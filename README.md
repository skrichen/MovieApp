# MovieApp
Prediction of movie genres and detection of spoilers in reviews

# Goals of the Project
Deciding what movie to watch with your significant other or with your friends can be the most difficult part
of movie night! It is not only time consuming but a real source of struggle. Agreeing on a movie genre usually
speed up the decision towards a common ground. Another way to help you decide which movie to pick is
to check out the reviews to find out if a movie is worth watching. However, many times people come across
spoilers that take away all the intrigue and ruin all the big moments!! As a movie lover, I have encountered
these situations several times and that is what motivated me into designing an app that predicts movie genres
and detects spoilers.
