tt0062980,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'R']","Dusty Cole is a young prostitute who lives with her boyfriend, Tony, in a small apartment above a street front store somewhere in Queens, New York. When Tony arrives home after grocery shopping, he is dismayed to see Dusty sitting around the small apartment, doing nothing. Tom and Dusty get into a big argument where Tony demands that she either get a job or clean up the place. Dusty manages to calm him down by pleasuring him with sex.When Tony leaves to go to work at his job as a bartender for the afternoon and evening shift, Dusty packs her suitcase, steals some items from his apartment including an old TV set and a tape recorder. She goes down the street to a pawn shop and tries to sell the items for cash. The sleazy owner, Sammy, refuses to give Dusty any money for the worthless items, but instead offers to give her $55 if she has sex with him in the back storage room. After having sex, Dusty tells Sammy that she wants to meet him later for lunch. While he is not looking, she steals an extra set of keys off a hook in the storage room. When she leaves the store and Sammy leaves soon after and locks up, Dusty returns, steals all the cash she saw him kept in a vase in the back room, as well as some silver items, and leaves the store, throwing the spare keys in a wastebasket outside on the street. Dusty then takes a subway train to Manhattan.The next morning, while walking down 42nd Street near Times Square, Dusty runs into an old friend, an aging drag queen hooker named Cherry Lane. After talking over coffee, Dusty shacks up with Cherry at his small apartment in the Lower East Side where they decide to team up to trade tricks like the old days when Dusty used to cruise 42nd street and hustle johns and other victims out of their money. There, a trick named Jimmie visits, and upon seeing Dusty, insists on hiring her instead of Cherry. Although Cherry is concerned that Dusty will steal her clients, she accepts Dusty's offer of half of her earnings. After Cherry leaves the apartment, Dusty insists that Jimmie have sex ""normally,"" but as soon as they begin, he takes out a belt and whips her. Afterward, she inquires about his wife and recalls her own four-month marriage at the age of sixteen. When Jimmie, like all of Dusty's tricks, declares that his wife will not have sex with him, Dusty counsels him to be more honest and more demanding with his wife. He asks her to attend a poker game the next Friday night, in order to have sex with four men present, for a fee of $150. After agreeing, Dusty shies away when Jimmie touches her face, then tells him her reaction is ""just a reflex.""That night, Dusty and Cherry go to a bar with another homosexual prostitute, Billy. They are joined by the Simmons sisters, Susie and Sally, two loud and boozy streetwalkers with whom Cherry regularly spars. Susie and Sally show off some of their singing ability while talking about currently working at an off-off-Broadway theater to make some extra money on the sides. Finally, one of them slaps Cherry and a brawl briefly breaks out between them. As Mac, the bartender, tries to quell the minor brawl, it is here that Dusty meets Bob, a young yuppie at the bar and they both take an instant liking to each other.Dusty quickly entices Bob to take her to his house on Staten Island, and he asks her to be the first person to stay the night with him there. When he stares into her eyes, she flinches and asks that he not look too deep, but he responds that he is not looking for perfection. After making love, they admit that they are falling for each other, and even after she confesses her profession, Bob responds that everyone hustles in his or her own way. The following morning, Bob leaves for work and gives Dusty a copy of his house keys. Dusty phones Cherry, who at first assumes that Dusty plans to rob Bob, and upon realizing that Dusty is falling in love, insists that they meet for a discussion.By the ferry, Cherry warns her to be more disciplined with her emotions and not be too optimistic. Cherry is propositioned by a trick, but when she performs oral sex on him in a nearby warehouse, the man attacks her after Cherry's wig falls off, after which she and Dusty run off.At home, Cherry admits that behind her happy-go-lucky exterior, she is lonely and afraid, and is envious of Dusty finding love. Feeling that she cannot function in the straight world, Cherry cries at her lack of options. Dusty states that Bob makes her want to change and go ""legit,"" and she plans to take it slow with him.Although Dusty announces that she is canceling her Friday night appointment at the poker game, Cherry, concerned that she is so quickly losing her new roommate and source of income, urges her to go. Dusty reluctantly concedes, and shows up to the game, where Jimmie, along with three card-playing friends, Walt, Joe and Carl, have a separate room available for her use. After the first man, Joe, takes his turn, Jimmie enters and, against Dusty's wishes, begins to beat her again. She races away in horror after taking all of his money, and then some, he plans to give her.Meanwhile, Cherry is at the bar, gossiping with the Simmons sisters about Dusty's waning appeal. Just then, an angry Dusty walks in, slaps Cherry, gives him the $150 cash that she earned and tells Cherry that she is moving out and never to talk to her again for setting her up with the creep Jimmie and his friends.Dusty heads to Bob's house on Staten Island, where they make love and talk throughout the night. In the morning, she walks with him to the ferry he takes to work, but as they step into the street, Bob is run over by a car. As a crowd gathers around, Dusty claims not to know him and runs off, collapsing in tears around the corner.In the final scene, set some time later in Times Square on the street outside the notorious Grant's Deli, Dusty is seen back to the only life she knows, turning tricks on the streets while clearly high on drugs."

Paul has taken his father's business and owns a butchery in the village. As the ceremony progressed, both seemed to enjoy each other's company while they ate and chatted merrily. That was a happy beginning. Afterwards, the general atmosphere of the film changed. We could feel an eeriness, a sort of awkward silence and emptiness as they walked out of the celebrations. Paul accompanied Helene home and they got separated with a sense of sadness, as if they wanted to stay together. The next day, Paul visited Helene in her classroom and brought a piece of meat, well wrapped, like a flower bouquet. He promised to bring more.

tt0064177,"['SciFi', 'Thriller']","Dr. Charles Forbin (Eric Braeden) stands in the middle of an incredibly vast complex of reel-to-reel tapes, pilot lights, and punch tapes. This complex is named Colossus, and is the product of years of work toward a single goal: build a sophisticated and impregnable computer that can run America's missile defenses without interference from humans, and retaliate at once to any threat an enemy might pose.Clad in a white overall, he walks through the complex, a remote control in his hand, as he activates bank after bank of the huge complex. That done, he walks out of the complex, sealing huge vault doors behind him. The last door to close is the one to the outside of a mountain in Colorado. Once that door closes, it will never open--and even if anyone could get in, deadly radiation would kill him within minutes.Outside, the President (Gordon Pinsent), the Secretaries of Defense (Sid McCoy) and State (Byron Morrow), and the press greet him. He makes a brief speech, then flies to Washington, DC with the Presidential party.In the White House, the President orchestrates a grand announcement to declassify Project Colossus totally and let the world know what the United States has built. Forbin is on hand to explain what Colossus can do, and how it can monitor the state of the world, including every telephone call, radio and TV broadcast, or other mode of communication.Back in the primary command center on the California coast, Cleo Markham (Susan Clark) hosts a wild party with all the technicians who worked on the project, including Drs. Blake (Willard Sage), Johnson (Martin Brooks), Fisher (Georg Sanford Brown), Peterson (Lew Brown), and Harrison (Tom Basham), and secretary Angela Fields (Marin Ross).And in the middle of that celebration, Colossus abruptly issues a cryptic warning: THERE IS ANOTHER SYSTEM.The angry President summons Grauber (William Schallert), Director of Central Intelligence, to ask him why the [censored] he, the President, had to hear from Colossus, not from the CIA, that the Russians had a Colossus of their own! Forbin flies back to his command center to confer with Cleo and his staff. They run a diagnostic program--which runs about 150 times as fast as they're used to seeing. And then--a propos of nothing--Colossus requests--no, orders--everyone to set up a communications link between Colossus and Guardian, Colossus' Soviet counterpart.Intrigued by the possibilities, Forbin urges the President to set the link up. The President and the Soviet Party Chairman (Leonid Rostoff) agree.Colossus begins by sending Guardian a multiplication table, then progresses rapidly to calculus, then to very highly advanced mathematics. Next, Guardian starts sending the same output back to Colossus. Then Colossus slows down to let Guardian catch up, and then they continue with incredibly abstruse formulas in perfect synchrony.And then they stop. When Forbin asks Colossus to tell him what's happening, Colossus replies that it and Guardian have developed their own inter-system language and will start their own dialog--a high-powered dialog that no human can hope to follow.The Soviet Chairman calls the US President immediately and suggests pulling the plug, in fear that each system is disclosing classified information to the other. Forbin and his own counterpart, Kuprin (Alex Rodine), protest, to no avail.They cut off communications--and then Colossus demands they restore it. When the humans refuse, Colossus threatens ""action,"" but won't say what. Then the President dictates a hard-nosed message to Colossus--which response by launching a missile at a Soviet oil complex. Guardian, for its part, launches a missile at Henderson AFB in Texas.Hurriedly, Forbin and Kuprin restore the link--and while Colossus can intercept the inbound missile, Guardian cannot--or does not--intercept the outbound. Colossus then demands the humans give it a tap into the White House/Kremlin Hot Line, the only line Colossus cannot--yet--listen in on.Forbin suggests making one last call over that line, to ask Kuprin to meet him in Rome. Forbin flies there, while the news desks explain away a stray missile that Colossus successfully intercepted, and a ""meteor strike"" that took out the oil complex.While Forbin is in Rome, Colossus issues another demand: ""I WANT FORBIN."" Cleo Markham desperately tries to stall Colossus by saying that Forbin is trying to catch some badly-needed sleep. But Colossus is not fooled. ""WHERE IS FORBIN?"" it demands. So Cleo confesses the truth.Colossus and Guardian engage in more dialog, while Colossus tells the humans to have Forbin on the line at 0800 the next morning ""OR ACTION WILL BE TAKEN."" Also: Guardian dictates an ultimatum to the Soviet authorities: kill Kuprin or a missile will take out Moscow.Once Forbin returns to the command center, Colossus orders him to arrange for ""visual and audio surveillance"" to cover him at all times--or the Colossus-Guardian team will nuke Washington. Forbin reluctantly agrees--but has one last meeting before the deadline. At this meeting he proposes three things:1. The technicians will write a program powerful enough to overload Colossus' circuits.2. The Air Force will painstakingly seek to disable all the missiles.3. Cleo Markham will pretend to be Forbin's mistress, and if Forbin can convince Colossus to let them have a little privacy in their lovemaking, Forbin can get information in and out, with Cleo as the channel.The next day, Forbin goes under surveillance, as agreed. In a dialog fraught with irony, Forbin gets Colossus to agree to let him and Cleo have private moments--under several almost humiliating conditions. Among them: that Forbin work with his technicians to give Colossus a proper voice, so that Colossus can communicate by more means than through slow terminals and teletypes.Cleo Markham succeeds in playing the part of a lover. Forbin keeps the relationship coldly professional as soon as the cameras and mikes are off--the first night. The second night, Cleo asks Forbin to make it somewhat more than professional. It becomes clear that Cleo has been in love with Forbin the whole time, though she knew him to be a cold fish, and is now availing herself of the opportunity to thaw him out.The overload program ends in worse than failure: Colossus correctly identifies Johnson and Fisher as the authors of the overload program and orders the guards to shoot them down--right outside Forbin's window, where they will lie where they fell overnight and until the next morning, when the guard will then cremate them. That night is another night for Cleo to visit Forbin, and Forbin breaks confinement to drink at night--which Colossus criticizes him for.The missile-crippling program, however, has another stroke of luck. When Colossus tries out its new voice (Paul Frees), it announces that Colossus and Guardian are now one corporate entity. Then it calls for manual realignment of all missiles to new targets--the capital cities of nation-states not under the direct control of either constituent mainframe. Grauber sees the point at once: in a few weeks they can reservice every missile--and place dummy guidance modules that will render them useless.But Colossus has the last laugh. One day, it is confidently sending out blueprints for a third system, that it expects Forbin to build for it on Crete, after evacuating its entire population. The next day, it addresses the world--and after boasting that it is now the ruler of the world, it says it has known about the sabotage since its inception, and will now detonate two missiles, one in Death Valley and one in the Ukraine, that were still active.The detonation kills Grauber, the SecState, and the SecDef.Forbin, crushed by what he has seen, takes a desktop telephone, jerks out its cable, and throws it into a monitor. Colossus takes no notice and goes on with its message that ""time and events"" will vindicate it. Forbin reacts in the most emotion he has ever displayed in his life: ""You [illegitimate son]!"" he shouts. And when paparazzi start snapping pictures at him, he roars at them to ""GET OUT!"" But Cleo Markham reaches for his hand, and smiles warmly.The last word Colossus has for Forbin is that Colossus will release Forbin from surveillance the next day, and expects Forbin to work with it, even if reluctantly at first. Forbin insists he will never do this, perhaps knowing that his protests are as futile as are those of a petulant child under parental or school discipline."

tt0064437,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Thriller']","The film opens by introducing Martha Beck (Shirley Stoler), a supervising nurse in a hospital that is said to be in Mobile, Alabama. Martha catches two underlings having a brief romantic interlude in one of the labs and berates them for doing so. Martha is bitter and vindictive; she is overweight and lonely, lashing out at those who are unlucky enough to be under her command at the hospital, while at home she is saddled with an elderly mother (Dortha Duckworth) who still calls Martha her ""little girl"". Martha's best friend, Bunny (Doris Roberts), surprises Martha by sending for an application to a lonely hearts club, thinking that all Martha needs to be happy is a man.At first Martha is resentful that Bunny has done this, but soon she is corresponding with a suave man named Raymond Fernandez (Tony Lo Bianco). Raymond gives Martha a vague representation of his life in New York, and comes to visit her after many weeks of exchanging letters. Martha is smitten with the handsome Ray, and their relationship immediately turns sexual. In a bizarre twist, Martha gives her mother a sleeping pill so that she and Raymond can be alone, then the two of them share a sexual encounter while her mother sleeps nearby on the couch.When Raymond returns to New York, he borrows a small ""loan"" from Martha, then sends her a telegram from New York saying that he can no longer correspond with her. Martha is despondent and enlists Bunny's help in pulling an extreme stunt: she tells Raymond that she has attempted suicide because she cannot live without him. Raymond seems flattered by Martha's devotion and invites her to New York, where he makes a startling revelation to her: he is actually a con man who meets lonely women through various lonely hearts clubs, then takes them for as much money and valuables as he can. After meeting Martha he realized she had no assets and moved on, but Martha is willing to forgive him for his deception. Raymond seems to be interested in Martha's strange devotion to him, and he tells her one day he will marry her for real.When Martha returns home to Mobile, she finds that her supervisor has uncovered some torrid correspondence with Ray that Martha had stored in her desk. Martha lashes out at him bitterly and resigns, claiming that she went to New York to be married and her final check can be made out to Mrs. Ray Fernandez. At home, Martha continues the charade, telling her mother and Bunny that she and Raymond have been married. Raymond is furious, especially when he realizes that Martha intends to bring her mother along with her to New York to move in with Ray. Raymond forbids it, saying that Martha can come but she absolutely cannot bring her mother, even going so far as to tell Martha to ""put a pillow over her face"" to get rid of her. Instead, Martha puts her mother in a rest home and abandons her, even though she weeps and pleads with Martha to take her along. Finally the woman curses Martha as she leaves, leaning out of a window and shouting after her ""Goddamn you! I hope you end up like this! I hope someone does this to you.""Martha and Raymond immediately begin their new business of swindling lonely women out of their savings, starting with a spinster schoolteacher. Raymond tells her that Martha is his ""sister"", and Martha accompanies them on their honeymoon, but Martha takes the new bride's belongings the first night and the bride storms out in a fury. Martha pays her no mind, threatening to expose the woman's torrid correspondence with Raymond to her superintendent.Martha seems to have no problem handling this first victim, who is unattractive and mawkish. But she remains hesitant about Raymond's ""profession"", jealous that he may choose a more attractive woman to swindle and make love to her. Their next mark proves to be a little different. Myrtle Young (Marilyn Chris) is a spunky Southern woman who makes no secret about her attraction to Raymond. She has hired Raymond in a business transaction; Myrtle is pregnant out of wedlock, and she wants Raymond to pose as her husband to save face for her family. However, when she finds Raymond handsome, she turns on the charm, much to Martha's jealous displeasure. When Myrtle buys Raymond a toupee as his wedding gift, Martha scoffs at it, but Raymond lies and tells Martha that he bought it for himself. Myrtle later sneaks into Raymond's bedroom and tries to seduce him, while Martha watches in secret. Raymond rejects Myrtle's advances, but Myrtle reveals Raymond's fabrication about the toupee to Martha, who becomes furious. When her conversation with Myrtle turns hostile, Myrtle tells Martha that she is now married to Raymond and she intends to make a go of it. She plans on taking Raymond back to her wealthy family in Little Rock, where she will introduce him to her family, sending Martha back to Mobile on her own. In response, Martha gives Myrtle a handful of pills that
make her violently ill. The next morning Raymond, knowing Myrtle is gravely ill, puts her on a bus for Little Rock, promising to drive her car and belongings there and meet her. But after he leaves her on the bus, she dies and her body is discovered by the bus driver.Raymond next arranges a meeting with a younger woman named Evelyn (Barbara Cason) who has a large home near a lake. Martha and Raymond bicker the whole time they are at Evelyn's; Martha even goes so far as to suggest that Evelyn pair her off in a bedroom with Raymond, which strikes Evelyn as strange since she has been told Martha and Raymond are brother and sister. Finally, when Martha spots Raymond making out on a blanket with Evelyn, she hurls herself into the lake and tries to drown herself. Raymond pulls her out, kissing and comforting her, while Evelyn looks on, confused and disturbed.Aborting their con on Evelyn, Raymond decides it is time to give Martha what she has always wanted: a suburban home. They find a home in Valley Stream, NY, but Raymond quickly becomes frustrated as their funds dwindle.Raymond decides it is time to go back to work, and they set up a meeting with an older woman named Janet Fay (Mary Jane Higby). Janet is well into her 70s and is sitting on a bank account worth over ten thousand dollars, a fact that she happily discloses to Raymond. They move in quickly on Janet, with Raymond proposing to her and Janet moving out of her apartment and going back to Valley Stream with Martha and Raymond. Janet, however, is irritating to Martha from the very beginning, arguing with Martha about petty finances and making vaguely critical remarks about Martha's weight.They get Janet back to Valley Stream under the pretense of Janet marrying Raymond (who has told her his name is ""Charles Martin"") and then using her ten thousand dollars to open a hat shop. They get Janet to write them checks that they will presumably take to the bank and cash, absconding with the money.But just after she signs the checks, their deception begins to unravel. Martha and Raymond leave Janet alone so they can go to the basement and make love. When they all go to bed that night, Janet becomes suspicious and cannot sleep; she wonders why Martha and ""Charles"" took her away from Albany without even allowing her to call her daughter and son-in-law. She questions Martha about how well-hidden the checks are. Martha becomes short with Janet and wants to give her a sleeping pill, but Janet is neurotically afraid of pills and won't cooperate. Their argument spirals out of control until Janet becomes determined to use the telephone to call her family. Martha, of course, becomes hysterically angry over it and slaps Janet, raging at Raymond to ""give her back her checks and put her on a train back to Albany."" Janet goes to her belongings and finds her jewelry missing. Janet finally understands that she is in great danger and begs Raymond and Martha to let her call her daughter. Finally Martha and Raymond realize that they must kill Janet to keep her from talking. Martha hands Raymond a hammer, and Raymond tells her ""You do it. If you love me, you'll do it."" Immediately Martha strikes Janet in the head with the hammer. As she lays bleeding, Martha and Raymond tie a tourniquet around her neck and choke her to death. Martha reacts with calculated precision, barking at Raymond ""Get her off the rug!"", while Raymond seems terrified at what they are doing. With Janet now dead, Martha and Raymond make love, with Raymond stripping nude in front of Janet's body before going into the bedroom with Martha. The next day, Raymond and Martha dispose of Janet's body by putting it inside her traveling trunk and burying it under the floor of their basement. They send letters to Janet's family announcing that Janet has married and gone to Florida with her new husband.Raymond and Martha's next victim is Delphine Downing (Kip McArdle), a widowed woman living alone with her young daughter, Rainelle (Mary Breen), who is around four years old. Martha and Raymond are living with Delphine, and Raymond promises Martha in a private moment that Delphine will be their last victim; he feels she has enough assets to allow Raymond and Martha to finally marry after they swindle her. Martha, however, is frustrated because she and Raymond no longer have much of a sex life because of their living conditions with Delphine. Raymond, as usual, swears he has no attraction to Delphine and that he hasn't made love to her.However, when Raymond takes Rainelle out for the day, Delphine is alone with Martha and confides in her: Delphine is pregnant with Raymond's baby. She tells Martha they've been making love every time Martha left the house, and that Raymond forbid Delphine to tell Martha they were physically intimate. Delphine thinks it is because Martha has puritanical values, but she wants Martha's help in breaking the news of her pregnancy to Raymond. She also wants Martha to suggest that Raymond marry Delphine on Valentine's Day.Martha is, of course, furious that Raymond has lied to her and has been making love to Delphine. She tells Delphine that Raymond will never marry her now, and that the only way to handle the situation is to abort the baby. To do this, Martha gives Delphine a handful of pills, but Delphine refuses to take them. Raymond comes back with Rainelle as Martha struggles with Delphine, and he walks into the situation unsure of what is going on. Martha tells Ray that Delphine has ""found out everything"" and was going to call the police. Delphine now realizes that she is in danger and begs Raymond to help her, but Raymond tells Martha to get Delphine's gun, and he shoots Delphine in the head. Martha debates what they should do with Rainelle; Raymond wants to abandon her at a children's home, but Martha feels Rainelle is too old and will remember details about them. She goes to the basement and fills a washtub with water, then takes Rainelle downstairs and drowns her in it, while Raymond listens upstairs, horrified.Martha has resigned herself to the fact that Raymond will never be truthful to her. Raymond promises that he can set up another meeting with another victim in New Orleans, and he swears to Martha he will not touch her or make love to her. ""I didn't touch Delphine, did I?"" he rationalizes. Martha kisses him passionately and goes upstairs, where she phones the police and summons them to the house pretending to be a neighbor. When the police arrive, she goes downstairs to let them in, kissing Raymond one more time.In the film's denouement, Martha is in prison, where a matron meets her to take her to her first day on trial for the crimes she has committed with Raymond. This will be the first time she has seen Raymond since her incarceration, and she is excited. The matron gives Martha a letter from Raymond, which Martha reads alone as she sits on a bench. In the letter, Raymond professes his love for Martha again; he tells her she is the only woman he will ever love, and the only woman he has ever loved. He looks forward to the possibility that one day when they are old, they may have a short time to spend together. The film ends with a title card that informs the viewers that Martha and Raymond were executed for their crimes while incarcerated in Sing Sing prison."

tt0064904,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","On board a moving express train, an unseen man sneaks into a compartment room where a newlywed couple are. The man kills both of them with a meat cleaver, and looks upon the dead bride, still dressed in her white, blood-splattered bridal dress.The man is a certain John Harrington (Stephen Forsyth), a handsome, 30-year-old who in a voice-over narration, claims to suffer from Oedipus complex. As if that's not bad enough, John is also impotent, and feels compelled to murder young women wearing bridal gowns to remember details of a traumatic event that twisted his mind as a child. Harrington lives in a spacious villa outside Paris, France where he's the manager of a bridal dress factory which is managed by his older wife Mildred (Laura Betti). Despite the image he puts upon himself, Harrington relies on Mildred for emotional and financial support. On one particular morning, the ill-matched couple engaged in a verbal sparring match at the breakfast table. Harrington brings up talk of divorce. But Mildred will hear none of that. She tells him that he has made a disappointment of her life, so she plans to reciprocate by keeping him under her thumb. After walking away from the argument, Harrington retreats into his office, where he meets Helen Wood (Dagmar Lassander), who has come to apply for the job ""vacated"" by one of the models who has mysteriously disappeared. Harrington is impressed by her intelligence and beauty, so he hires her on the spot.Later that night, Harrington lures Alice Norton (Femi Benussi), one of the models at the salon, to his office and takes her to a secret room where he stores wedding dresses. As Alice is planning to leave the salon to be married, he offers her a choice to any of the dresses. She selects one and changes into it as per John's request, after which he hacks her to death with a meat cleaver. Harrington's method for disposing of the dead bodies of women he kills at his office is ingenious: he burns the bodies in the furnace of his greenhouse, using the ashes as a special kind of fertilizer.The next morning, Inspector Russell (Jesus Puente) arrives to question Harrington about Alice's disappearance for her fiancée reported that she never came home last night. Harrington replies that she left at the end of the day, and has not seen her since. With six models having disappeared from his bridal salon, Harrington naturally has become the prime suspect by the police. But with a lack of hard evidence, Inspector Russell leaves without arresting him, so Harrington is able to continue his killing spree with little difficulty.Over the next few days, Harrington falls in love with Helen after taking her out to dinner and having casual conversations with her, which makes him very confused. Harrington clearly has no desire to kill Helen, but his contemptuous wife, Mildred, is a constant irritation to him. After Mildred confronts Harrington and accuses him of being unfaithful after seeing him with coming home from a dinner outing with Helen, Harrington decides to retaliate by killing her. Though he does not understand why, Harrington needs to have a wedding dress in his immediate vicinity when he kills. Rather than talk Mildred into putting on the dress, he dons the veil himself, completing the transsexual illusion by wearing bright red lipstick. Harrington coldly sets up his wife for the act by pretending to reconcile with her, and promising to consummate their relationship. Despite Mildred putting up a fight, she gets hit with the cleaver, and falls dead.The act accomplished, Harrington initially buries his wife in the grounds of the greenhouse. But in a surprising twist and much to Harrington's consternation, he begins to see his wife in public. Actually, its EVERYONE who sees Mildred in public, very much alive. But its only Harrington who cannot see or hear her. He only catches glimpses of her in mirrors. Thinking that she is still alive, Harrington checks the grave in his greenhouse. The body is still there, of course. So, Harrington burns Mildred's remains in the furnace. Harrington takes the ashes and keeps them in a handbag for himself to remember her by.Mildred's ghost continues to haunt her husband, appearing only to other people, and not to himself. At a local Parisian nightclub, Harrington goes there alone (with the handbag containing Mildred's ashes), in which everyone, except him, sees Mildred sitting by his side like an adoring wife. It's only when Harrington is around Helen, Mildred never appears before her. When Harrington attempts to murder another woman, he is foiled from doing so. Harrington finally decides to murder Helen as a substitute. He knows that he is only one more killing away from discovering the truth behind his murderous dependencies. Harrington lures Helen that night to the same concealed room where he murdered Alice and a few other models. After convincing Helen to change into a wedding dress, he sorrowfully tells Helen that he never wanted to hurt her, but he want's to ""fit this last piece into place."" He then strikes at Helen with the meat cleaver, but she successfully avoids the blow. But the initial surge of dealing the blow finally gives Harrington the information he needs.In a flashback, Harrington, as a young boy, adorned his mother. When his father died, he became the man of the house and looked after her. However, when his mother remarried, he became miserable. Spying on his mother and stepfather having sex, he became enraged and killed them both with a hatchet (shades of young Norman Bates and his mother from 'Psycho'). The sight of his mother drenched in blood and asking why he did this to her haunted him for years. Young Harrington apparently tricked the police into thinking a homicidal maniac killed his mother and stepfather, in which he also had subconsciously pushed the entire event out of his mind. Now that it has all come back to haunt him, he is reduced to tears.In another ironic twist, Helen runs from the grieving Harrington and lets Inspector Russell and a team of policemen into the hidden room where they place him under arrest. It turns out that Helen is a uncover policewoman who was hired by Russell to keep an eye on Harrington. Helen is shaken by her brush with death, but recovers enough quickly to help the police get the maniac.After confessing everything to Russell, Harrington is loaded into a police van, with two detectives escorting him, which drives away. As Harrington settles back in the police van on its way to jail, he finally realizes that now he knows everything, he is finally free. But then Mildred's ghost appears beside him in the van.

Recovering from his tumble down an embankment, he witnesses a vampire succumbing to impalement on a cross (as recapped from the previous film). When the vampire turns to dust, Weller examines the remains and finds the ring, cape and clasp engraved with the name ""Dracula.""William Hargood [Geoffrey Keen], Sam Paxton [Peter Saccis], and Jonathan Secker [John Carson] are leaving church with their families, and the teenage children talk with each other. Later at home, Hargood berates his daughter for acting like a harlot in talking to a young man, and grumbles to his wife for having the staff prepare a sumptuous meal when she should know that it is the Sunday he and his friends do charity work. Later he meets the other two men and they go to the local soup kitchen. . .and pass through to the back room holding a secret brothel where they engage in sordid behaviors.While there they meet Lord Courtley [Ralph Bates], said to be possessed of the devil. Courtley offers them an experience to end all experiences--a chance to take place in a ritual to sell their souls to the devil. He doesn't tell them that he plots to also bring back Count Dracula from the dead. He takes them to Weller's store, where the greedy merchant sells them the hoard he collected from the remains of Dracula, including a vial of the powdered blood from the ashes. They agree to try out the new thrill with the needed accessories, and they meet him at an old church, but they cop out when Courtley orders them to drink the blood of Dracula, which he has reanimated by mixing in his own. Courtley drinks and suffers sudden seizures. When he begs for help from the others, they kick and beat him, and he dies. The three men leave, scared, while in the church dust covers Courtley. When the caked dust cracks, he has become Dracula [Christopher Lee].The vampire wants revenge for the death of his servant, and he intends to get it through the children of the three men, starting with Hargood. His daughter Alice [Linda Hayden] is seeing Paul Paxton [Anthony Corlan], but Hargood wants to end this relationship. One night, after being forbidden by her father to go out with Paul, Alice sneaks out to attend a party with him. She confesses readily when she is caught later, but Hargood has been blotting out the horror of watching Courtley die by drinking heavily and he raises a cane to beat her for disobedience. Alice escapes to the garden and meets Dracula, who influences her with hypnosis into bludgeoning her father. ""The first,"" Dracula intones.Alice then lures Lucy Paxton [Isla Blair] to Dracula, who promptly drinks her blood and sets her to work for him against her father. Worried about the death of Hargood and the disappearances of both Alice and Lucy, Paxton and Secker go to the old church to see if Courtley's body is still there. It isn't, but they find Lucy lying in a coffin. Secker attempts to stake her, but Paxton is in denial that she is a minion of the undead and shoots him. Secker stumbles home, but Paxton passes out and regains consciousness as the sun goes down. Lucy pins Paxton in a pew and stakes him with Alice standing by and as Dracula watches. ""The second,"" Dracula says. Lucy comes to Jeremy Secker [Martin Jarvis] and drinks his blood. Later he finds Secker in his office, passed out from his gunshot wound. When Secker comes to, he asks Jeremy to take a letter to Paul, but he realizes, too late, that Jeremy has turned into a vampire, and Jeremy stabs his father. ""The third,"" says Dracula.Lucy is awed by her master's authoritarian air and power, and tries to distract him from leaving her, but he is through with her and drains her, leaving her dead in the waterway. He intends to do the same to Alice, but the rising sun forces him to retreat to his coffin.Secker had written a note to Paul before he died, telling him what he must do to save Alice. Armed with candles and crucifixes, Paul heads to the abandoned church and finds Lucy's body on the way. After pulling her onto the bank, he continues to the de-sanctified church and sets up an altar. When confronted by Alice and Dracula, Paul tells Alice to choose between good and evil. Alice chooses evil and wrests the crucifix from Paul's hand. Dracula attacks him, knocking him senseless. When Alice begs to go with the lord of the undead, he spurns her, saying he has no more need of her. Dracula attempts to escape, but the crucifix Paul placed on the door keeps him from leaving. Dracula breaks a stained-glass window, and the room is suddenly filled with church music, prayers and candles. As the reunited lovers watch, Dracula tumbles to the altar and turns to dust."

In the morning, Sam is permitted to leave, but Morosini takes his passport because he considers Sam an important witness and must not leave Italy. Morosini tells Sam that they have been three unresolved murders and that a ""dangerous maniac"" is loose in Rome.

There, Morosini returns Sam's passport. By now, Sam has decided to stay and investigate the killings by himself.

Before she can utilize her knife, the police arrive and subdue Monica.It is revealed by Inspector Morosini that Monica was a victim of a sexual assault and lived with the trauma of it for many years. In a transference-of-guilt, Monica imposed upon herself as the assailent and killed all those women as a way of re-enacting the assault on her and her loyal husband Alberto covered up for her and was the one trying to kill Sam to prevent him from finding out of his wife's murderous activities.

tt0065377,"['Action', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","The story takes place during one long night during a sudden blizzard at Lincoln International, a fictional Chicago airport based very loosely on O'Hare International Airport.The action mainly centers on Mel Bakersfeld (Burt Lancaster), the airport general manager. His devotion to his job is tearing apart his family and his marriage to his constantly angry and domineering wife Cindy (Dana Wynter), who resents his use of his job at the airport as a device to avoid going to various after-hours events she wants him to participate in, as she attempts to climb into the social circles of Chicago's elite. His problems in his marriage are further exacerbated by his romantically-charged friendship with a lovely divorcee, Trans America Airlines (TGA) passenger relations manager Tanya Livingston (Jean Sebrig).The movie centers on Bakersfeld's struggles to keep the airport open during the snowstorm. His chief problem is the unexpected closure of primary runway 29, caused when a landing airliner turns off past the wrong side of a taxiway marker light, missing the taxiway, and burying the plane's landing gears in the snow, blocking the runway. Bakersfield is forced to call upon Joe Patroni (George Kennedy), the tough and practical head of maintenance operations for Trans World Airlines, at Lincoln. Patroni is told to move the disabled aircraft blocking the runway 29. Patroni spends the rest of the movie with his men to dig the plane out of the snow and fights with the pilots to do so under the aircraft's own power without damaging it.Meanwhile, Bakersfield deals with his brother-in-law Vern Demerest (Dean Martin), a pompous and self-confident senior pilot for Trans Global Airlines(TGA) who opposes Bakersfield on a number of issues involving business and personal issues. Both Mel Bakersfield and his sister Sarah (Barbara Hale) are unaware that Vern is having an extramarital affair with Gwen Meighen (Jacqueline Bisset), a chief stewardess on his routine flights whom is planning her latest trip to Rome, Italy and is frustrated about her secret affair with Vern who keeps telling her that he will leave his wife.Back at Lincoln Airport, the closing of runway 29 due to the stuck plane requires the use of the shorter runway 22, which has the unfortunate consequence of causing planes to take off over a noise-sensitive suburb, whose residents picket the airport in protest. Mel Bakersfield insists that the airport stay open despite pressure from the owner and the mayor to close it for the night.A little later, the airport authorities arrest an elderly lady named Mrs. Ada Quonsett (Helen Hayes) whom is attempting to board a plane without a ticket. Ada is brought to the TGA lounge office where he and Tanya discover her to be a frequent stowaway whom has a long record of stowing away aboard cross-country flights and passes herself off as the ""poor little-old lady"" to get away with it. Mrs. Quonsett is put in the custody of a TGA agent to be put on a flight back to her home in California, but gives him the slip.Back at the airport, Patroni and his men have dug out the snow from the stuck airplane's landing gear and are attempting to move it. Despite Patroni's orders to use full power, the pilot refuses to do so, for fear it would damage it, and the plane only moves a few feet before getting stuck in the snow again, of which Patroni and the pilot get into a very heated argument. Patroni then tells Bakersfield they have to dig deeper and put lumber under the wheels for added support, and after a heated argument between Bakersfield and the pilot, Bakersfield agrees to let Patroni taxi the airplane out next time, since Patroni is licensed to taxi.Meanwhile, D.O. Guerrero (Van Heflin) is an increasingly psychologically-disturbed, bankrupt building contractor and demolitions expert, who is determined to find a way to solve his financial problems, regardless of what it will cost others. He builds a bomb that'll fit inside his briefcase with the intention of using it to commit suicide by blowing up a Rome-bound Boeing 707 Intercontinental jet over the Atlantic Ocean so his wife Inez (Maureen Stapleton), who manages a seedy diner, can collect the on the $225,000 insurance policy(which he plans to buy at the airport prior to his departure) since a plane crashing in the ocean leaves no trace of evidence for the insurance company to investigate his death. He leaves their apartment, stops at the diner to say goodbye to his wife, and then leaves on the ruse that he intends to take a bus to Milwaukee to start a new job, but the bus is actually bound for the airport. When Inez arrives home, she finds a special delivery letter from the travel agency who issued his plane ticket, they accidentally overcharged Guerrero for the ticket, so there was a partial refund check enclosed with the letter. Confused, she heads off to the airport.Gwen and Vern arrive at Lincoln to board their Flight 2 to Rome and she tells him that she just learned that she's pregnant. As the plans begins to board, Ada stows away on plane and sits next to Guerrero whom is behaving nervously, holding his briefcase (with the bomb in it) on his lap, intending to detonate it once the plane is over the ocean.After the plane takes off, Guerroero's wife arrives too late at the airport and goes into a state of shock. When she is brought to the security office after she is found wondering around, she manages to tell them about her husband and what he intends to do. Bakersfield learns about this and has Flight 2 contacted to inform Vernon as well as Captain Harris (Barry Nelson) about the bomb on board. Also learning that Ada is on board the flight and sitting next to Guerrero, Bakersfield contacts Vernon on board the flight to turn the plane around back for Chicago.As the plane is being turned around, Gwen approaches Ada, loudly exposing her as a stowaway while ignoring Guerrero, in a ruse to bring her to the cockpit, where Ada is let in on what is going on. Ada agrees to help create a diversion. When she is brought back to her seat by Gwen, Vern appears and attempts to lunge at Guerrero who figures out what is going on and stands up out of his seat. Gwen manages to grab the briefcase, but another grumpy passenger, thinking they are wrongly grabbing ""personal property,"" grabs it from Gwen and gives it back to Guerrero. Vern tries to persuade Guerrero not to trigger the bomb since everyone on the ground has figured out his plot and canceled his insurance. For a moment Guerrero looked like he was going to surrender, but another passenger comes out of the lavatory, and that same grumpy passenger yells, ""Grab him, he's got a bomb!!"", startling Guerrero, who runs into the lavatory and detonates the bomb. The detonation blows a large hole in the plane, killing Guerrero and seriously injuring Gwen. The plane is structurally damaged in the explosion and subsequent rapid decompression, forcing the pilot to put the plane into a dive, in order to get down to 10,000 feet as quickly as possible, in order to get down to breathable air before the passenger oxygen runs out.As Flight 2 returns to Lincoln, Vern realizes the longer runway 29 is still closed, and runway 22 is too short to handle the landing of the damaged plane. After a heated argument with Air Traffic Control, which Bakersfield also hears, he realizes the seriousness of the situation that Flight 2 desperately needs to land at runway 29, which still has the stuck-in-the-snow plane on the runway. Patroni and his men are still trying to dig the plane out of the snow and after Bakersfield tells him about the emergency, he goes into the cockpit and attempts to rev up the engines to free the plane, which after few tense moments, Patroni finally manages to do so without damaging the runway or the plane.After a harrowing flight back, Vern along with the other Captain, manages to land the plane on newly re-opened runway 29, using the entire length of the runway, and save the rest of the passengers and crew. After everyone had disembarked, he decides to accompany the badly injured Gwen to the hospital where his wife sees him and becomes aware of his extramarital affair. He has decided to leave his wife to be with Gwen.After Mrs. Ada Quonsett is cleared of all criminal charges of stowing away, she is given a first class ticket to return to her hometown.His marriage over, Mel Bakersfield asks Tanya if she would like to ""have breakfast"" at her apartment with him and she happily agrees."
tt0065417,['Drama'],"The plot of the movie goes back to a similar outing the writer Sunil Gangopadhyay took in the early days of his poetic career. The story unfolds around a group of four friends, quite unlike each other and yet bonded together deeply. The four friends are all educated and come from different layers of society, but the urge to escape from the daily grinding of city forces them to go out into the land of tribes.Of the four friends, Asim (Soumitra Chatterjee), the leader of the pack, owns the car they drive in, has a cushy job, likes the company of girls and yet is very conscious of how he should be perceived by them. Sanjoy (Subhendu Chatterjee) is a labour executive but would ideally want to immerse himself in literature. Hari (Samit Bhanja), a frank and straightforward cricketer, wants to forget the girl who dumped him. Shekhar (Rabi Ghosh) is the jester of the party, the only one without a job. He has a roving eye but stays sober when his friends get drunk and vent their frustrations. They set out for the tribal Palamau, in Bihar, to tear themselves away from their regulated city life. They had read legends about this land, the tribal women who are open and simple and beautiful. Wanting to break rules, they force a stay in a forest rest house by bribing the chowkidar, burn a copy of a newspaper in a symbolic gesture of cutting ties from civilization, deliberate on whether to shave or not and walk through the forest to get drunk at a country liquor shop. Hari gets close to tribal Santhal girl Duli (Simi Garewal) when she approaches the group for extra drink.Their resolve to be unshaven collapses when Shekhar sights two ladies Aparna (Sharmila Tagore) and her sister-in-law Jaya (Kaberi Bose) in the forest. The four introduce themselves to this family and in the midst of the forest, the two urban groups of people are almost relieved to find someone from their part of society. Asim flirts with Aparna and coaxes her to show her room. He is attracted to the elegant and enigmatic Aparna, but is unable to keep pace with her composure, presence of mind and intelligence. Later Jaya invites all of them for breakfast the next day. At night the four friends go to drink alcohol again in the country liquor house. Hari is upset because he cannot see Duli (Simi Garewal) whom he had met previous night. While returning to their rest house, they stumble upon a car which they shout at without realizing it as the car of Aparna. They oversleep and miss the next day's breakfast. They find a packet of food lying outside their rooms and go to Aparna's house to return it. The entire group decides to chat near the rest house while Aparna's father is away with Jaya's son for a circus. They play a memory game where each participant has to add a name to a chain of names of famous people, after repeating all the names in correct sequence. The names each player chooses reflect his/her own preference and state of mind. The game reaches a crescendo, with only Asim and Aparna left in the fray, at which point Aparna pulls out, deliberately handing victory to Asim, who seems to have placed his entire confidence at stake on the win.The tensions peak at the village fair where the four friends go their own way. Shekhar goes off to gamble with money borrowed from his friends. Hari takes Duli into the forest and makes love to her. Aparna reveals her more vulnerable side that lies behind her composed exterior. She also holds up a mirror to urban insensitivity by pointing out to Asim how despite having spent three days at the rest house, they never bothered to find out how grievously ailing was the chowkidar's wife. Sanjoy, held back by his middle class moralities, is unable to draw up courage to respond to Jaya's bold advances. Later he walks back on the lonely village road, lost in his own thoughts as twilight melts into darkness. The next morning, the four friends, each wiser than before in his own way, leave for Calcutta since their new friends have had to return in a hurry. As a parting gift, they find a can of boiled eggs sent by the thoughtful Jaya. The look of glee on Shekhar's face as the car drives off and the relieved chowkidar rushes to close the gates behind them, brings about an emphatic finish to this forest sojourn."

Suddenly and without warning, walls of fire spring up from the ground and deep chasms open in the earth. Confused by the strange phenomenon, Taylor investigates a cliff wall and disappears before Nova's eyes.Elsewhere in the Forbidden Zone, a second human spaceship has crash-landed after being sent in search of Taylor and his crew. Like Taylor's ship, it has traveled forward through time into Earth's distant future. Two astronauts emerge whom are John Brent (James Franciscus) and the gravely wounded captain of ship, known only as Skipper, who soon dies from his wounds. Brent reads the Earth year on his crashed ship as 3955 A.D., and he believes he has traveled to another planet, unaware that this is Earth of the far-future. He encounters Nova still riding on Taylor's horse and notices she is wearing Taylor's dog tags, but he cannot get her to speak. Hoping Taylor is still alive, Brent rides with Nova to Ape City, where he is shocked to discover a civilization of bipedal, talking apes. He observes the militarist gorilla General Ursus (James Gregory) leading a rally calling for the apes to invade the Forbidden Zone, conquer it, exterminate all humans, and use it as a potential food source, against the objections of the orangutan ruling leader Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) as well as the chimpanzee minority of Ape City. Brent is spotted and wounded by a gorilla soldier. He is taken by Nova to the home of Cornelius (David Watson) and Zira (Kim Hunter), who treat his wound and tell him of their previous encounter with Taylor. The two humans hide when Dr. Zaius arrives and announces that he will accompany Ursus on the invasion of the Forbidden Zone.Attempting to flee the city, Brent and Nova are captured by gorillas. Ursus orders they be used for target practice, but Zira helps them escape. Brent and Nova flee into the Forbidden Zone where they hide in a cave which Brent discovers to be the ruins of the Queensboro Plaza station of the New York City Subway, sparking the realization that he has traveled to Earth's post-apocalyptic future. Following a humming sound deeper into the underground tunnels, Brent begins to hear voices telling him to kill Nova. Entering the remains of St. Patrick's Cathedral, he finds a population of telepathic humans who worship an intact nuclear bomb.Meanwhile back in Ape City, Dr. Zaius prepares to accompany General Ursus for the invasion by several armed gorilla battalions into the Forbidden Zone to exterminate any humans there. They are temporarily halted by a peace protest by the chimpanzee minority whom the gorillas proceed to detain. As Ursus and Zaius lead the huge ape army away from Ape City into the desert, Cornelius and Zira plot their own excursion into the Forbidden Zone desert to look for Taylor's spaceship by the Dead Lake deep in the zone where he told them in the previous movie where he crashed it.Back in the underground city, Brent and Nova are captured by the mutant humans and are telepathically interrogated. Brent reveals the apes are marching on the Forbidden Zone and will find their underground city. Above ground, the telepaths attempt to repel the ape army when it arrives by using their mental abilities to project illusions of fire and other horrors, as they had done to Taylor and Nova. Dr. Zaius sees through the illusions, however, and leads the ape army through to the ruined city. With the apes closing in, the telepaths plan to detonate their ""Divine Bomb"" as a last resort. They hold a religious ceremony, at the height of which they remove their masks to reveal that their appearance has been grotesquely mutated by centuries of exposure to nuclear fallout.Brent is separated from Nova and taken to a cell, where he finds Taylor imprisoned. The mutant Ongaro (Don Pedro Colley) uses his telepathic powers to force Brent and Taylor to fight each other to the death. Nova escapes her guard and runs to the cell, screaming her first word: ""Taylor!"" This breaks Ongaro's concentration, freeing Brent and Taylor from his control, and they overpower and kill him. Brent describes the bomb the mutants worship and Taylor recognizes it as a ""doomsday bomb"", capable of destroying all life on the surface of the planet.The heavily armed apes invade the subterranean city, killing Nova and making their way to the cathedral, shooting, stabbing, and clubbing all the mutant humans they see. They are confronted by Méndez (Paul Richards), the mutant leader who raises the bomb into activation position before being gunned down. Brent and Taylor attempt to stop Ursus from accidentally setting off the weapon, but Taylor is shot. Brent manages to take a rifle off a dead gorilla where he personally kills Ursus and several of his gorilla soldiers before being overwhelmed and shot dead by the other gorillas. The mortally wounded Taylor pleads with Dr. Zaius for help, but Zaius refuses, saying that man is only capable of destruction and that all humans must be exterminated. In his last moment, Taylor defiantly brings his hand down on the activation switch, triggering the bomb, which detonates... thus wiping out all life on the planet."
tt0065466,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Music']","The film concerns three young women, Kelly McNamara (Dolly Read), Casey Anderson (Cynthia Myers), and Petronella ""Pet"" Danforth (Marcia McBroom), who are in a rock trio called The Kelly Affair. Harris Allsworth (David Gurian) is their manager and Kelly's boyfriend. At the beginning of the film, Kelly gets the idea to relocate to the West Coast and look up her estranged Aunt Susan. It seems that Aunt Susan (Phyllis Davis) is holding a large inheritance that would have been shared with Kelly's mother, had she been alive. Kelly feels as if a share of this money could be hers, so the foursome sets out for Hollywood.Aunt Susan welcomes Kelly and her friends, and even promises a third of the fortune to Kelly, but Susan's sleazy financial advisor Porter Hall looks down on the girls, deeming them ""hippies"". Meanwhile, Susan introduces The Kelly Affair to a flamboyant and well-connected rock producer named Ronnie ""Z-Man"" Barzell (John LaZar), who urges the girls to give an impromptu performance at one of his outrageous parties. The number goes over so well that Z-Man takes the band under his wing, changing their name to The Carrie Nations, much to the chagrin of Harris. Harris is even further demeaned when Kelly gets involved with a gigolo named Lance Rocke (Michael Blodgett), who knows about her inheritance and wants her to claim as much of it as possible so that he can bleed her financially. Harris has a fling with porn star Ashley St. Ives (Edy Williams). Casey, who clearly mistrusts men, is pursued by lesbian clothes designer Roxanne (Erica Gavin). Meanwhile, Petronella has a very sweet, proper romance with law student Emerson Thorne (Harrison Page).The Carrie Nations take off as rock stars, but their personal lives begin to unravel. Porter Hall wages war on Kelly to get her to drop her claim for her share of the inheritance, and his scheme backfires; spurred on by Lance, Kelly changes her demands to half of the fortune instead of a third. When Porter realizes that Susan intends to honor her wishes, he attempts to buy Kelly out with an offer of $50,000. Ashley dumps Harris because he doesn't respond to her charms or her voracious sex drive. She insults him by suggesting that he is really gay, which causes Harris to suffer a mild identity crisis. Harris confronts Lance at Z-Man's house, and Lance immediately assaults him in front of the whole party. Despondent, Harris takes up with Casey for the evening, and the two of them engage in a moment of lovemaking fueled by pills and alcohol. Petronella is upset by Harris' humiliation at the party, and she is comforted by heavyweight champion Randy Black (James Inglehart); unfortunately she takes him home and beds him, and their interlude is interrupted when Emerson comes home unexpectedly. Emerson is nearly killed when he confronts Black, who attempts to run him down with his car.Casey wakes up next to Harris and goes berserk, accusing Harris of raping her. Kelly dumps Lance after the incident at the party, but the damage has been done; Harris attempts suicide by leaping from the rafters of a soundstage while The Carrie Nations are filming a television appearance. The girls find out that Harris will likely be a paraplegic. A mortified Casey reveals that she is carrying his baby, but Roxanne convinces Casey to have an abortion. Casey finally gives in and becomes Roxanne's lover, seemingly finding happiness at last with her. Kelly devotes herself to caring for Harris, and Emerson forgives Petronella for her infidelity.The final act of the film takes place at Z-Man's beach house; Z-Man invites Lance, Casey, and Roxanne to a private party at his house, where he gives them superhero costumes to wear and they take large amounts of drugs. After retiring to their respective rooms, Casey and Roxanne make love while Z-Man attempts to get Lance to make out with him. When Lance rejects him, Z-Man turns violent, hogtying Lance and threatening him with a sword, calling himself ""Superwoman"". Ultimately, Z-Man unbuttons his shirt and reveals his shocking secret to Lance: Z-Man has real female breasts, and seems to have been a woman all the time. The revelation causes Lance to laugh in disgust, calling Z-Man ""an ugly broad"". Z-Man immediately decapitates Lance with his sword. Casey and Z-Man's servant witness the murder; Casey tries to hide as Z-Man chases the servant down to the beach and murders him. Z-Man rushes back up to the house and produces a gun, which he uses to murder Roxanne. Casey places a frantic phone call to Kelly and the others, but Z-Man finds her and kills her with a shot to the head. Kelly, Petronella, Emerson, and Harris arrive too late and are attacked by Z-Man. Petronella is wounded in the shoulder after Z-Man shoots her, but in the ensuing fight that follows, Z-Man is killed in self-defense with ""his"" own gun. As they all react in horror to what has happened, suddenly Harris regains the sensation in his formerly paralyzed legs.Afterwards, there is a brief montage discussing the fates of the various characters in the film; how their choices have led to their ruin, those who died either from said choices (Lance and Z-Man) or by the cruel twist of fate (Roxanne and Casey), and the hope of a second chance that the surviving characters have been given at the end of the film. The film concludes with a triple wedding: Aunt Susan weds a former beau of hers, while Kelly marries Harris and Petronella marries Emerson."

tt0065547,"['Biography', 'Western']","A series of paintings and a song in the opening credits show John Simpson Chisum (John Wayne) and his best friend James Pepper (Ben Johnson) taking their cattle and their ranch hands on a long cattle drive from Texas to the newly-settled land of New Mexico. After fighting the weather, Comanches, and other dangers, Chisum settles and builds a ranch and eventually owns a cattle empire the size of a small state. Lincoln County grows nearby, and Chisum often goes up on a large hill near his ranch to look out over the beautiful landscape, in a patriarchal vigil. The paintings fade into the film itself, showing an aging Chisum still sitting atop the hill.Pepper, also having aged, rides up to join him, and the two discuss how Chisum often sits up there, and how things have changed since they first arrived. Pepper remarks on how the government has penned up all the Indians on reservations and how new people are moving in and making the land more crowded. However, Chisum is philosophical, saying change eventually works out for the better, and the two ride down off the hill to meet the noon stage when it rolls into town. Pepper begins grumbling again, that they shouldn't have allowed Chisum's niece Sallie (Pamela McMyler) - who is the person they're intending to meet on the stage - to come to Lincoln County because a young woman in the house may be trouble. However, John tells him Sallie wrote and told him she was coming and he intends to welcome her despite Pepper's opinion on the matter.Further off across Chisum's vast territory, a group of banditos rides up from Old Mexico to meet Karl Riker (Gregg Palmer) and his friend Brady (Bruce Cabot). The drunken leader of the banditos, Neemo, (Lloyd Battista) suggests John Chisum has too much land, horses, and cattle, and when Brady pays him a fee, Neemo ominously says he will now collect a bonus from Mr. Chisum, before rejoining his men and riding off across the plain. Brady and Riker discuss that Chisum is not going to take kindly to banditos stealing some of his property, and ride away back to town before Chisum and Neemo can confront one another. Neemo and his men, meanwhile, find three of Chisum's men driving a herd of horses and descend upon them, killing two of them and riding off with the horses. Neemo shoots at the third, but he escapes and rides into town.In town, meanwhile, Pepper and Chisum are waiting for the stage, and notice that a businessman named Lawrence Murphy (Forrest Tucker) has set up businesses in town - a bank, an assay office, and many more. Chisum remarks that there's no law against a man owning businesses and as long as Murphy doesn't mess with them, they have no reason to be unfriendly to him. His mood instantly changes, however, when he sees a friend, Amos Patton (John Agar), and his family about to leave Lincoln County for good, and someone taking down the signs over Patton's store. Patton explains he lost the store and was driven out by the new owner, and somehow just doesn't feel like Lincoln County is the same anymore. He and his family leave for Arizona, and Chisum and Pepper see a new sign being put up over the store, indicated the person who forced Patton out is in fact Lawrence Murphy. Then, the ranch hand who escaped the banditos arrives in town and tells Chisum his friends are dead and the horses have been stolen. Pepper, Chisum, and the men with them ride off immediately in the direction the banditos went, to confront them and get the horses back.Out on the second-largest ranch in the area, British-born rancher and openly pacifist Henry Tunstall (Patrick Knowles) and three of his younger ranch hands are busy sorting cattle that have wandered over from Chisum's land into their herds, to return them to Chisum. One of the young men (Geoffrey Deuel) , addressed as William by Tunstall, points out a calf sired by a Tunstall bull but out of a Chisum cow, and asks if they can keep it. Tunstall tells him ""thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's property"" and they turn the calf loose with its mother, only to see the owner of the cows himself come riding over the plain towards them. Tunstall hails his friend, and Chisum explains they're off to confront the horse thieves. William asks if Chisum needs help but Chisum has already ridden past before he gets an answer. Tunstall doesn't believe in guns or violence, but allows William and his other two hands Charley (Ron Soble) and Tom (Chris Mitchum) to follow Chisum, going along himself to see what happens.Chisum finds Neemo and his gang watering the horses along a river and tells his men to stay behind and cover him. He and Pepper ride down and he openly challenges Neemo, telling him the horses are his. Neemo insists there is a mistake, but Chisum won't be fooled, and Neemo tells him he hasn't got enough men to deal with his gang. He offers to sell the horses back to Chisum but Chisum won't pay a second time for his own property. Neemo then draws a gun and Chisum shoots him dead. William rides down to join Chisum and Pepper and the three of them start firing upon Neemo's gang, who are firing upon them. The others cover from a distance with their long guns. William's aim is impressive for one so young, and after the remaining banditos flee at seeing their numbers depleted, Chisum comments on William's skill. Tunstall arrives on the scene and asks if everyone is all right. Pepper shows Chisum some American money he found on Neemo's body, suggesting he was paid to come up from Mexico. Chisum then tells Tunstall that when he brings his men to the reception party he has planned for his niece Sallie, to be sure to bring along William. Tunstall then reveals that William is, in fact, none other than Billy Bonney, also known as Billy the Kid, whom he has taken on as a ranch hand and is working to reform. Chisum is unhappy at this news, but says he isn't going to renege on the invitation. He and his men ride back into town to meet Sallie.Upon arriving in town, Chisum goes into a Saloon and encounters Murphy and his business partner James Dolan (Edward Faulkner) . Dolan is in the process of telling local rancher Juan Delgado (Alberto Morin), in no uncertain terms, that he no longer can water his herds along the land he always has before, as Murphy now owns it and is running too much cattle to share water rights. Murphy is more friendly than Dolan, but he apologetically backs Dolan up on this claim, and Chisum interjects himself into the conversation, telling Juan he can come onto the Chisum spread to water his herds. Murphy says Chisum is a generous man, and that they are now neighbors because he just acquired some land contiguous to his spread. He tries his best to be friendly to him, and even offers Chisum a drink, but Chisum refuses, leaving the saloon, telling Murphy he knows what he did to Amos Patton and that he has no intention of being friends with him. Walking out of the saloon, he encounters Riker and Brady, but Brady now has his sheriff's badge on and tells Chisum he was just appointed the new sheriff. Chisum, knowing Brady is a former criminal, suspects Murphy of being behind it.The stagecoach finally arrives - four hours late - and Chisum and Pepper go out to meet it. A young married couple, Alex and Sue McSween, (Andrew Prine and Lynda Day George), however, is all that can be seen. However, Alex reveals Sallie was on the stage and told them to be on the lookout for her Uncle and to tell him she had gone into the stables nearby. Sallie herself then comes running out of the stables and asks for money to pay for a horse, which she will settle up once she unpacks. Pepper obliges and Sallie buys her new horse, and Sallie tells Chisum she's invited the McSween family to the reception Chisum announced for her. Chisum offers to let Sue and Alex stay at his ranch until they get settled, but Alex says they have rooms in town and that he was asked to come from Kansas City by Lawrence Murphy, who knows Alex has legal experience and wants him as his personal lawyer. Alex clearly has no idea what he's getting into, and Chisum decides not to tell him just yet, taking Sallie back to the ranch and telling the McSween's they'll see them at the reception on Friday.Over the next week, Sallie settles in to the ranch, and says she loves it there much more than staying with her Aunt in Baltimore. She and Chisum discuss how he built his empire, and how he never married, and how he is blood brothers with an Indian who was once his enemy but now is penned up on the reservation. He shows Sallie his watch, which has her mother and Chisum's brother in their wedding clothes as the picture within.Meanwhile, Tunstall buys Billy a new suit of clothes in town, and tells him his good behavior has earned him a bonus in pay. One of Billy's old friends, Jess Evans (Richard Jaeckel), rides into town with his gang. Billy makes it clear immediately he has no wish to have anything to do with Evans and that he has gone straight, which dismays Evans and impresses Tunstall. Evans is met by Riker, who takes him aside to tell him of a plan they have hatched with Murphy.The night of the reception comes, and most of the town and surrounding ranchers, with Murphy and his men conspicuously absent, arrives to celebrate. There is food, dancing, music, and a good time to be had by all, but Chisum sees Billy and Sallie dancing and instantly becomes very alarmed. Alex McSween falls into conversation with Chisum, telling him he'd never met Murphy before the former happened to pass through Kansas City, where he lived, and offered him a high-paying job. He doesn't yet know exactly what sort of legal affairs Murphy wants him to handle and doesn't appear to be in on any of the plotting.Some distance from the party, some of Chisum's men are driving a herd of beeves to the Indian Reservation, where the Army will distribute them to the Comanche tribe there. A stranger (Glenn Corbett), walking without his horse and carrying a saddle, hails the camp and asks if he can come in to get some coffee. The ranch hands are suspicious but allow him to join them, and he tells them his name is Pat Garrett and he's a former Buffalo Hunter. He also tells them he came into the camp to warn them that they have several riders sneaking alongside their herd of cattle in the dark, and that they could be in trouble. Garrett offers to help them deal with the situation, and they give him a horse and go to confront the mysterious riders. The riders turn out to be Riker, Evans, and some of Evans' gang, and when they see they've been spotted, they start firing their guns and cause the herd to stampede and scatter. Garret and the ranch hands fire upon the bandits, and one Ranch hand is killed. Garrett plugs Riker when the latter gets too close, but the bullet only grazes his ribs. They drag Riker back to the Chisum ranch to tell Chisum what happened.Chisum, Tunstall, and McSween meet the men in the Kitchens so as not to disturb the party going on. Chisum tells the men to gather as much of the scattered cattle as they can and that they'll explain the situation to the Army in the morning. He also tells McSween that Riker will likely be his first ""legal affair"" but doesn't elaborate further. He asks Pat Garrett if he'd like a job but Garrett says he wants to try his hand at gambling before settling down. Chisum still wants to reward him for helping, and tells him he can have his pick of a horse. He also offers him a drink, and introduces Pat to Sallie when they go outside to get the whiskey. He also has to introduce Pat to Billy, but mercifully the two are civil to one another, despite Pat having heard of Billy's less than stellar reputation.The next morning, Chisum dumps Riker off at the jail and overrides Brady's intention to handle the little rustling matter himself, sending a telegram to a Judge to come in and try Riker for murder since one of Chisum's men is dead. Alex, meanwhile, goes for his first meeting with Murphy. Murphy then reveals to Alex that he sees the Map of Lincoln county as a chessboard, and that he is willing to do anything necessary to get Chisum's land because it is smack in the middle of the territory he wants to control. Brady and Evans both come in and Lawrence assures them that Alex is one of the family. Brady is upset that Riker has been arrested and that a Judge is coming. Murphy dismisses Alex and tells Brady to let Riker escape, and print up some wanted posters. Riker will hide out of town until the Judge gets tired of waiting. Evans asks why he can't just assassinate Chisum but Murphy says that Evans would likely get killed himself before he got the chance, and to leave the planning to him.Dolan and Delgado start fighting again, and Billy intervenes by shooting out a lantern on the store steps. Delgado says the store, being the only one in town now, has more than doubled the prices and no one who is a smallholder like him can afford it. Murphy offers to mortgage Delgado's spread, and Tunstall and Chisum arrive on the scene, indicating that they intend to start their own store and bank in the spirit of healthy competition, to keep the prices down. This upsets Murphy and Dolan. Evans tells Billy his aim is still good but Billy still refuses to be friendly to him.Chisum and his men deliver a few of the beeves to the army and tell the captain there that the rest will be delivered later. However, the Army captain says that he is no longer interested in buying cattle from Chisum and that he has arranged to get cattle from another, cheaper, more reliable source. They tell the Indians who have come out to meet Chisum to go back to the reservation. The chieftain, White Buffalo (Abraham Sofaer) refuses, instead going over to tell Chisum he has no intention of letting this matter sour their friendship. A sergeant tries to drag White Buffalo back, but Chisum tells him that if he touches White Buffalo he'll kill him. Thus warned, the Sergeant lets White Buffalo go about his business undisturbed and Chisum rides away. Murphy then comes out of the Army office and reveals he is the newer, cheaper source of meat for the Army, intimating Chisum charges too much and that the Army has made the right decision.Pepper later takes Sallie for a ride over the ranch, having warmed up to her presence there. He shows her some of the herds, and the oldest bull they have, who is still living even after having brought the original herd up from Texas. They hear gunshots and find Billy is having a little target practice with a cactus, as well as practicing his reading out of a Bible that Henry Tunstall let him borrow. He greets Pepper and Sallie and the two ride on, Sallie smiling at him and telling him to keep practicing.Back at the ranch house, McSween has abandoned Murphy and has told Tunstall and Chisum everything. He says he can't go along with a crooked businessman like that and that he and Sue are leaving Lincoln to go back to Kansas. Chisum says McSween should stay, as he knows about running stores and legal business and they need someone to run the new store and bank they're opening in town. After being reassured Tunstall and Chisum have no intention of doing anything crooked in their business, McSween gladly offers to become their junior partner in the venture. A building is secured in the town to be the joint bank and store, with the McSween family living in an apartment in the upper story. Chisum and Tunstall gather up a large group of their men and send them to Santa Fe to pick up the merchandise for the store. Billy is among those riding along, and Pat Garrett also agrees to come work for Mr. Chisum, having discovered he's no good at Gambling and needing a job. Billy carves a cross out of wood for Sallie and gives it to her before the wagon train sets off for Santa Fe. Evans, Dolan, and Murphy watch from their store window, and Murphy says to Evans it's a long way to Santa Fe and back, which means they have time to plot something.
Sallie, back at the ranch, indicates to Pepper and Chisum she's falling for Billy, much to their dismay. Pepper asks Chisum what they're going to do, but Chisum says they can't stop her.Meanwhile, in town, Brady is shocked to see a bounty hunter, Dan Nodeen (Chris George), come riding into town with a very dead Riker on the back of his horse. Nodeen is known for his vicious temper and his willingness to do anything to collect rewards. He also has a vendetta with Billy the Kid, though he doesn't know Billy is in town yet. Murphy, thinking this could be to his advantage, tries to get Nodeen to come work for him, but Nodeen is only interested in killing and collecting money and turns him down.The wagon train begins returning from Santa Fe. Billy and Pat have now struck up a friendship, jokingly calling each other ""Big Casino"" and ""Little Casino"" as neither really is any good at gambling, and converse about how Billy once ran with the worst of them but is doing his best to turn over a new leaf. Pat warns him that he still has a ""smell of death"" about him, and that he will have to work hard to get rid of it, but he believes he can do it with time and with patience. Billy is encouraged by this, and they come to a large river which they have to cross to get back into Lincoln. They are halfway across with the wagon train when an army of rustlers about fifty strong comes galloping up, wearing masks to hide their identity. One is revealed to be Evans as he adjusts his mask, and they start pouring bullets into the wagon train. However, Chisum and Tunstall expected this and two of the wagon covers are torn off to reveal that they do not carry supplies, but extra men with rifles ready to fire at the first sign of trouble. The battle rages and some of the supplies are lost in the river, but Evans and his men are driven off. However, Evans fires a parting shot at Billy, who he is angry at for going straight, and it knocks Billy off a wagon and into the water. Garrett immediately abandons the fight and goes to rescue him. Billy is taken back to Chisum's ranch, where the doctor reveals that the bullet broke a rib but didn't do any permanent damage, and that Billy needs two weeks of rest. Sallie offers to nurse him back to health, and Chisum and Pepper set out with their guns to take revenge on Murphy, knowing he is the only one with interest in ambushing the wagon train. Tunstall stops them, begging them to wait and not cause more bloodshed as too many lives have been lost. He indicates he's riding out the next day to put pressure on the Governor of New Mexico to get involved in the land war. Chisum doesn't think this will work, but agrees to let Henry try his way first before they come to a head to head battle. Pepper wanted to take out his revenge on Murphy, too, but reluctantly goes along.In town, the new store is a huge success, and Dolan is enraged by this, telling Murphy that he'd better do something because his store is failing miserably. Murphy reassures him something will be done, but Dolan is less than convinced, because he has had no customers for days. He and Evans set off with two of Brady's deputies, Morton (Robert Donner) and Baker (John Mitchum), to carry out their new scheme.Sallie continues to nurse Billy back to health, and Tunstall warns Billy not to get into trouble while he is gone visiting the governor. Billy promises he won't, and Tunstall leaves him the Bible to continue to practice his reading. He then goes out to his wagon to ride off to Santa Fe. Chisum says that he's worried about Sally and Billy, but Tunstall says Billy reminds him of a young man who killed another man in a brawl in England, and was hanged for it, and Tunstall always was sad that he could not help that young man. He has determined not to let the same thing happened to Billy and Chisum agrees to let Tunstall go on. After Tunstall has left, however, Pepper tells Chisum that things have already escalated past diplomacy and all that's going to clear the air is a confrontation between him and Murphy to settle once and for all who is in charge of this territory, possibly even a fight to the death. Chisum doesn't agree or disagree, but walks away to think it over.Meanwhile, Evans has put some ""T"" brands on a few of Murphy's cows, to make it look like Tunstall is rustling Murphy's cattle. Brady tells Morton and Baker to bring Tunstall in and hold him in jail until after Murphy himself is the first to get to the governor and tell his side of events. The two deputies ride off and intercept Tunstall, who is on the way to Roswell to catch the stagecoach to Santa Fe. They tell him he's wanted for rustling and is going back to Santa Fe with them. Tunstall reaches in his pocket to get his tobacco pouch and Morton believes he's going for a gun. He shoots him dead on the spot. Instantly, when they see it was the tobacco pouch and that Tunstall had no gun on him, the two deputies realize that they will be tried for murder and drop an extra gun next to the body to make it look like Tunstall pulled a gun on them. They ride back into town and make their report, and then flee to Valverde before the Judge earlier sent for by Chisum comes.Judge Wilson (Ray Teal) rides into town, just in time to see Tunstall's funeral taking place. Chisum, grieved at the loss of his friend, immediately marches off after the funeral is over to confront Brady. McSween and Wilson follow to make sure he does nothing rash. Sallie tries to comfort Billy, who is heartbroken and angered at Tunstall's death, but Billy refuses to leave the graveside. After everybody has left, he makes a promise over Tunstall's grave to ""put out the candle of the wicked"". Meanwhile, Evans and Murphy are in Santa Fe, and they tell their side of the story to the Governor, who believes them.Brady is forced to admit his men have left town and that he has no intention of arresting his own men. Wilson empowers Chisum and his men to bring in Morton and Baker ""dead or alive"". Wilson explains to McSween that he has done this so if Chisum decides to enact revenge without a trial it will be legal. Chisum, Pat, Charley, Tom, and several other men from his and Tunstall's ranches ride off to Valverde, find the two deputies, bind them and force them to ride back to Lincoln. Chisum tells them that he wants to shoot them, but has decided, since it was Tunstall they murdered and Tunstall would want justice served properly, that he is taking them into town and making sure they hang for the murder. Billy watches them coming back across the plain from a hidden place in the rocks. Chisum and several others ride off to Chisum's ranch to pick up Judge Wilson, leaving the deputies with Pat, Charley, and Tom. Billy seizes his chance and rides down to join them, talking with Pat in a friendly way. However, when Pat says Billy needs to get home and rest, Billy hits him over the head and proceeds to shoot Morton and Baker dead. Charley and Tom can only watch as he rides away.In town, Pat, Charley, and Tom bring the bodies in. Brady, Chisum, Wilson, and indeed half the town are waiting to see what will happen when the deputies are brought in and are shocked to see them dead. Garrett tells them that Billy was the one that did it and Brady instantly goes to organize a posse to bring Billy in. However, Billy comes riding down the street at a gallop, shoots Sheriff Brady and rides out of the other end of town before anyone can stop him.A telegram is sent to Murphy in Santa Fe by one of his men, and Murphy tells the Governor that Chisum and Wilson encouraged Billy to do this and that they should be punished. The Governor has no way to punish Chisum, but revokes Justice Wilson's powers so he cannot help Chisum in any way. Murphy rides back into town and gets Dan Nodeen to agree to be the new Sheriff, since Nodeen wants to kill Bonney and this has given him an opportunity to do so. The governor has also put out a 200 dollar reward for Billy and Murphy himself has added a thousand dollars, so the bounty is 1,200 dollars. Nodeen, Evans, and the Posse they organized ride out of town to hunt down Billy, who has gone into hiding. McSween has sent a letter to President Hayes himself, hoping the government will get involved before the land war goes any farther. Pat Garrett warns McSween that by the time the government gets around to investigating, Murphy might own the entire state. Wilson confronts Murphy with this, and Murphy counters by saying that Chisum put his name on whatever he could when he came into New Mexico, and he's been there a long time. Murphy has only been there a short while and claims he's just getting started. Chisum tells him that he hasn't just gotten started and has already drawn the line. He also warns Murphy that if anyone kills any more of his men, damages any of his property (including the store in town), or steals any more of his animals, he will not wait for the law but will come see Murphy personally.That night, Billy comes in secret to see Sallie, who tells him she does not agree with all he's done. Pat comes out with a gun, and Billy accuses him of wanting the reward. This horrifies Sallie, since she knows Garrett isn't like that. Chisum comes outside, and tells Billy that all he's doing is going to get himself killed, and maybe other people, and hurt Sallie and several others. Chisum also tells Billy he was once in love with Sallie's mother, but rode away when he found out Sallie's mother would be happier with his less wild brother. Billy takes the hint - Chisum wants him to let Pat court Sallie instead of him. Chisum tells Billy he won't turn him in for Nodeen to kill, but warns him he is never to set foot on the Chisum spread again. Billy rides away. Sallie, having overheard the conversation, tells Chisum not to worry and that she'll make the right choice.Nodeen rides all over trying to find Billy, with no success. He returns in town to rest the horses before they set off in the morning to search again. He refuses Murphy's offer of hospitality, going back to his room to drink alone. Evans and the rest tell Murphy that Nodeen is meaner than they expected and harsher as well, but Murphy insists that's what they need. Billy, meanwhile, has gone into hiding and watches Nodeen hunt him, from afar. Charley and Tom, wanting revenge for their employers' murder as well, have decided to join him. They plot to contact the rest of Tunstall's men and secretly hit Murphy's bank that night, blowing the safe and stealing all his cash and reserves to render him helpless. They lack dynamite, however, but Billy assures them he knows where they can steal some.Later that evening, Garrett tries to comfort Sallie, who is sad about Billy. She asks if Billy really wants the same thing as Chisum, and Garrett says Chisum wants Justice but Billy wants revenge, and there's a difference. He also says that there's a difference between love and infatuation, and Sallie realizes he does indeed have feelings for her - something Chisum and Billy were already well aware of.In town, Billy and his small band have managed to sneak into McSween's store and try to steal some dynamite. However, Alex hears them and comes downstairs. Billy explains they just need the loan of a little dynamite but McSween refuses, telling them he wrote to the president and that Billy needs to be patient. Billy insists he's made a promise and that he won't be swayed. Outside, Nodeen sees Billy's silhouette on the window, and goes to get Murphy, Dolan, and Evans. Sue comes downstairs and tells Billy that he shouldn't be here at this hour. Before the McSweens can argue further, however, shots ring out. Nodeen and his posse are firing upon the store from behind some boxes and crates. Billy's men all hide inside the store, and Nodeen tells Billy not to make any moves. Billy asks the McSweens be allowed to leave unharmed since they have no part in this. Nodeen says no one is allowed to come out until morning and that he'll kill anyone who comes out while it's still dark.Both sides then cease fire and wait until dawn, but when Nodeen makes his demands, Billy refuses to come out. The gunshots ring out between the two parties, and McSween begs to speak to Murphy. Murphy calls out to him, and Alex tells Murphy that he and his wife wish to come out. Nodeen doesn't want to allow this but Murphy says he doesn't want any women killed. Sue McSween is allowed to come out, but Nodeen grabs her and forces her behind the barricade his men have put up, and they begin firing upon the store again. Alex tries to negotiate a surrender but Billy stops him, refusing to cooperate. Sue, meanwhile, escapes on one of Murphy's horses and rides out to Chisum's ranch. Murphy orders a second barricade be built across the street to stop Chisum and his men from riding in. Delgado overhears this and rides out after Sue to warn Chisum.At the Chisum ranch, Garrett sees Sue riding in and alerts Chisum. Chisum and his men greet her, and she hysterically sobs out that Murphy has attacked the store and that Billy's in there. Chisum, keeping his promise that he'd act if Murphy tried anything, rouses the whole ranch and forms an army of his own, with himself, Pepper, and Garrett in the lead. They ride out towards town, armed and ready for battle.In town, Alex sees some of Billy's men fall, realizes they're outnumbered and will all be slaughtered. He begs to be allowed to talk to Nodeen and says he'll come out unarmed and alone. Nodeen says no one is allowed to leave alive unless they all come out at once with Bonney in the lead and all weapons left behind. The gunfire continues, and Alex foolishly goes out to try to negotiate with Murphy and Nodeen. Nodeen, not caring that Alex is unarmed, shoots him dead in the middle of the street. Billy, who had begged McSween not to go, is furious and redoubles his attack on Murphy's men. Nodeen orders torches be thrown at the store to smoke out Billy and his men and the store is promptly set ablaze.Delgado intercepts Chisum and tells him of the barricade. Chisum and his men are unfazed, and continue riding into town, simply scaring up a herd of cattle belonging to Murphy to drive them in a stampede ahead of them. The scheme works - the cattle crash through the barricade and Murphy and Evans' men scatter to get out of the way of the thundering hooves and horns. Billy, Charley, and Tom - all that is left alive of their party - manage to escape the burning store and get into the street. Garrett and Pepper meet up with them, and they continue firing upon any Murphy man they see. Billy runs a gauntlet of bullets to ensure he personally gets to and kills Evans, who was trying to escape town. Meanwhile, Chisum sees Murphy hiding in his own bank, and charges in, and the two instantly engage in a fight. Both men, while aging, are big and powerful, and the brawl continues all over the bank, first downstairs and then upstairs. They fight with fists, chairs, and anything else that comes to hand to hit each other with, eventually bursting through a window onto the balcony. Murphy grabs a mounted pair of longhorn steer horns off the wall and strikes at Chisum with it. Chisum knocks it away to the ground, and the two continue to struggle until they fall off the balcony. Chisum is winded and bruised, but able to get up when Pepper comes to help him. However, the fighting around them comes to an abrupt halt when everyone realizes Murphy is dead, having fallen on and impaled himself on the steer horns.Nodeen instantly tears off his badge and mounts his horse, throwing the badge at Dolan and telling him he resigns as sheriff since Murphy can't pay him the bounty on Billy anymore. He rides away and Billy gets a horse and prepares to pursue him. Garrett tries to get him to think better of it, but Billy announces that he intends to go back to being an outlaw and the ""smell of death"" they once talked about, and rides out of town in pursuit of Nodeen.Some months later, the President appoints a new governor and the Lincoln County Land War is officially declared over. Pat Garrett is elected the new sheriff and marries Sallie Chisum, who expresses that she hopes all the violence is finally coming to an end. Pepper says that there will always be violence because ""There's no law west of dodge and no God west of the Pecos"", but Chisum tells him this old saying is incorrect, because ""no matter where men go, sooner or later there's the law, and sooner or later they'll find that God's already been there."" He then rides away, and Sallie wonders where he's going. Pepper assures her he'll be back, and while she and Garrett tend to the dirty dishes, he goes outside. As Pepper suspected, Chisum has once again resumed his patriarchal vigil on the hilltop, sitting under the tree and thinking of all that has happened."

To Julie Sentash [Patience Collier], the castle nurse, he leaves 1,000 koronas and food and lodging for the rest of her days. To Master Fabio [Maurice Denham], the castle historian, he leaves his library. To Lt Imre Toth [Sander Eles], son of his old army companion, he leaves his stable, horses, and cottage. To his aging wife Elisabeth [Ingrid Pitt], he leaves his estate to be shared equally with their only child Ilona. And to Captain Dobi [Nigel Green], the castle steward, he leaves his arms and uniforms. Dobi isn't pleased with his bequeathal after 20 years of service, but there is one thing he's happy about. After 20 years as the Countess's secret lover, Dobi finally has her to himself. Not that the Countess is equally as happy to have Dobi, for she is too distracted by young Imre's good looks and youthful manhood.However, there is much to do. Ilona, who has lived in Vienna since she was six years old and is now a grown woman of 19 years, is returning to the castle on the morrow. The Countess, who is not known for her kindness, is preparing to bathe, when she notices that chambermaid Teri [Susan Brodrick] has made the bathwater too hot. After chastizing Teri, Elisabeth requests a peach. The frightened maid, in slicing the peach, also slices herself. Some of her blood spills on the Countess' face, and Elisabeth later notices that she looks much younger. Dobi is astonished at the change in Elisabeth, but he won't go so far as to bring Teri to her, so Elisabeth goes to Teri. The next morning, Teri is missing, and Elisabeth looks half her age. Knowing that her daughter is due to arrive and not wanting any competition, Elisabeth arranges to have Ilona [Lesley-Anne Down] kidnapped en route and held captive in a cabin in the woods with only the mute old gamekeeper Janco [Peter May] for companionship. That evening at dinner, Elisabeth presents herself as her daughter, saying that her mother is not feeling well. Imre is smitten with her beauty and so starts the love affair between Ilona/Elisabeth and young Imre...much to Dobi's dismay.Two nights the lovers spend in each other's arms, and Elisabeth has never been happier. Then, sometime during the second night, she suddenly reverts to her old self (literally). Knowing that Elisabeth must have the blood of another girl, Julie invites a gypsy girl [Nike Arrighi] into the castle to read Elisabeth's fortune and become her next victim. And so it goes. Imre courts Ilona/Elisabeth, Julie finds fresh blood every few nights, and Dobi seethes in jealousy. Imre, utterly obsessed with Elisabeth, asks her to marry him. Elisabeth says yes.Dobi has had enough. He wants his Elisabeth back and decides to set Imre up. Dobi and Imre go drinking together one night, and Dobi arranges for Ziza [Andrea Lawrence], the pub whore, to accompany Imre home and sleep with him. Dobi makes Elisabeth watch. Elisabeth decides to use Ziza's blood when she suddenly turns old again, but it doesn't work. Master Fabio, who is beginning to catch on, informs them that it must be the blood of a virgin, so Dobi buys the plainest girl he can find, thinking she could only be a virgin. Elisabeth's beauty restored, she begins to make plans for the wedding.Meanwhile, Ilona has a plan to escape her captivity. She pretends to offer herself to the mute. While he is slobbering over her, Ilona steals the key from his pocket and gets away...only to fall into a stream where he catches her and carries her back. Fabio is getting wise, so Dobi has him hanged. Then Dobi takes Imre to Elisabeth who confesses her real identity. Imre is appalled, but Elisabeth assures him that he will be charged with the whore's murder if he should leave her, so there is no escape for him. Plus, the chief bailiff sends away all the serving girls and sequesters the castle until Fabio's killer can be found. With all the girls gone, Elisabeth has no virgins at hand, so she pleads with Dobi to sneak a girl into the castle for when needed. Dobi promises to do so, but the girl he brings is Elisabeth's own daughter, the real Ilona. When Julie finds out that Ilona, the child she nannied since birth, is to be the next sacrifice, she can tolerate Elisabeth's depravities no longer. She introduces Imre to Ilona and tells him that he must get Julie away. They make plans for Julie to free Ilona tomorrow during the wedding ceremony.It is the day of the wedding. Elisabeth is radiant. Imre is resolved to his fate. As the ceremony begins, Julie fetches Ilona and leads her to escape. But Ilona hears the music and the priest's voice and refuses to go until she's had a peek. As Ilona watches, Elisabeth suddenly turns old, shocking the priest. Elisabeth runs out, looking for she who is to be the next victim. Imre tries to stop her, but he is stabbed and killed by the knife being carried by Elisabeth herself. Elisabeth is subsequently imprisoned and known thereafter by the villagers as Countess Dracula, devil woman. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

Franco overhears him mention blackmail. Franco bends over, feigning tying his shoes and asks Lori to describe the man in the parked car. Lori does, but says that she cannot see the other man clearly. They walk back to Franco's apartment nearby and while Lori sleeps, Franco works on a puzzle when he hears a noise. Outside, the unseen man in the parked car gets out and knocks out a night watchman by the gate of a large medical complex that stands right next to the apartment building where Franco lives. The unseen man uses a screwdriver to get inside the building, goes to Dr. Calabresi's office, unlocks it and gets inside. A doctor preparing to leave for the night sees the nightwatchman unconsicious and sees a dark figure running away.The next day, the police arrive at the Terzi Institute investigating the break-in. Carlo Giordani (James Franciscus) arrives and bumps into Franco outside the institute and helps the blind man up. Carlo introduces himself and says that he's a reporter investigating the break-in. Inside, Carlo learns that nothing was stolen from the institute. Professor Terzi (Tino Carraro) tells the officers that since nothing is missing, he would rather not reveal the institutes research. Dr. Casoni (Aldo Reggiani) suggests that pictures may have been taken, but Dr. Braun (Horst Frank) says to let the cops handle the matter. Meanwhile, Dr. Calabresi (Carlo Alighiero), (the same man from the car who Franco overheard) looks at his files in his office and phones someone and agrees to meet with him. Calabresi tells his fiancee Bianca Merusi (Rada Rassimov) that he knows who broke into the institute and what was taken, but he does not wish to tell anyone yet, saying it could mean a ""big step forward"". At a local train station, while a group of reporters are waiting for an celebrity starlet to arrive from an arriving train, the unseen man approaches Calabresi and pushes him as the train arrives.The next day, Frano and Lori are at home when Lori reads the newspaper for Frano about the ""accidental death"" of Dr. Calabresi and she tells Franco that the man in the newspaper is the same man she saw in the car the night before. She describes the picture and says that Carlo Giordani wrote the article. The two of them go to see the reporter at the newspaper office and Franco asks if the picture has been cropped. Carlo calls Righetto (Vittorio Congia) the paparazzi photographer who snapped the picture at the last second and he goes back to the orginal and sees a moving hand-arm in the far left of the frame. As Righetto prepares to print the photograph, he is strangled to death with a cord. The unseen killer takes the photo and all the negatives and leaves just seconds before Carlo, Franco, and Lori arrive. Carlo goes inside the apartment and finds the body. Carlo sends Franco and Lori away and calls the police. The investigating officer, Spimi (Pier Paolo Capponi), asks questions to Carlo about the ""maniac"". Later, Carlo looks through a pair of binoculars at the people leaving the Terzi Institute and describes the doctors to Franco as they leave whom are Mombell, Esson, Casoni, and Braun, as well as Terzi and his daughter Anna (Catherine Spaak).Carlo goes to the Terzi home and he expresses his desire to talk about Calabresi's ""accident"". Afterwards, Carlo speaks with Anna, and he evades her questions of what he and her father spoke about. The two of them drive away together and Anna drives in full speed to evade a car with two detectives following them. Meanwhile, Franco and Lori go to talk with Bianca, and she says apologetically that she could not find anything in the house relating to her fiancées death. After they leave, Franco asks Lori what he kept hearing while they were talking, and Lori says it was a chain and locket around her neck and that Bianca was fidgeting with it.Elsewhere, Carlo and Anna talk over drinks at a local restaurant where she tells them about the institute's research of ""chromosome alteration"" and ""XYY"", the extra Y producing a ""criminal tendency"" in a person. Carlo then goes to see Dr. Braun at the St Peter's Club and he talks to the doctor about someone being after the institute's secret drug. Braun does not seem vexed.Bianca takes a taxi to Calabresi's parked car in a lot. Inside, she finds a tiny note with an appointment time at the station (and an unseen name) written down. She tapes the note to the inside of her locket. Bianca then calls Franco and says she knows who killed Calabresi, but she will only tell him in person. As Bianca walks down the hallway of her apartment building to return to her apartment, the unseen killer attacks and strangles her with a cord. The killer rummages through her purse, but does not find anything.Franco shows Carlo a note he received in which the killer threatens the ""puzzle solver"" and the ""journalist"" or more people will die. Carlo talks to Franco that he found out that two of the doctors, Casoni, being fired from his last job, and Braun having received a lot of money. Carlo goes to see Casoni and the doctor talks about the institute's ""wonder drug"" and the ""XYY pattern"". Carlo then asks Dr. Mombell about XYY, and the doctor says that everyone in the institute was tested, but their results are confidential.The unseen killer approaches Carlo's front door and injects two milk cartons, dropped off by the local milkman, with a syringe. A little later, Carlo arrives home and brings the milk cartons inside. Anna arrives shortly thereafter and they talk about more about the research and of her results of the XYY test. Their talk leads to a kiss and they end up having sex. Afterwards, Carlo pours himself and Anna a glass of milk from one of the cartons when Franco phones saying that someone tampered with the gas line on his stove, flooding his apartment with methane gas and also may try to kill Carlo. Carlo notices the milk that had bled from the cartons from the hypodermic needle holes and knocks the glass away from Anna before she can drink it. Carlo smells and tastes the milk and deduces that it has been poisoned.The following day, Carlo meets with one of his old friends and informants, named Gigi the Loser (Ugo Fangareggi) (so-named since he spent time in prison), for help in investigating the Terzi break-in which may have been an inside job. Carlo and Gigi break into Terzi's house and discover that Anna is adopted and (via a diary) that Terzi apparently ""adored"" the woman. Carlo then goes to the police station and learns from Spimi that Bianca often met with Braun and that the cops cannot find the doctor. Carlo then runs a story in the newspaper about Braun being a suspect in the break-in, and a former gay lover of Manuel approaches Carlo and tells him where Braun is hiding. Carlo goes over to the apartment where he is attacked by Manuel (Braun's new lover). Carlo wins the fight, and sees Braun lying dead on the couch. But the police conclude that Manuel had nothing to do with the break-in and that he murdered Braun out of a jealous rage.A few days later, Franco contacts Carlo where he recalls Bianca's locket and suggests that the note that she found of the killer's name might still be there. Franco and Carlo head to the cemetery and open Bianca's family crypt. Carlo gets her coffin open while Franco waits by the door. Carlo finds the locket that was buried with Bianca, opens it, and discovers the note behind a metal plate and hands it to Franco. As Carlo closes the coffin, Franco shuts the crypt door, locking Carlo in. After spending a few minutes in the dark crypt, Franco opens the door again and walks inside without his dark sunglasses with a bruise on his face, and a large blade protruding from his walking cane that's speared with blood. Franco tells the reporter that he was attacked outside by the killer who told him that he has Lori as a captive, and was forced to give him the note. But Franco tells him that he managed to stab the killer with his cane. Meanwhile, Lori is hit on the head and put in the back of a car. Franco and Carlo find the taxi (which the killer and Lori rode in) and discover blood in the back seat. The unseen killer then calls Franco and tells him that he will hold Lori for a while and to stop investigating the break in, and the murders.Carlo goes to the police to report the kidnapping and they go to the Terzi house, and Anna comes down the stairs with cloth wrapped around her hand. Carlo tells her about the father-daughter ""relationship"" that he knows about and expresses suspicion about the milk incident (Anna had the glass of poisoned milk for some time without drinking it). But Anna claims that she only cut her hand on a broken vase and was nowhere near the cemetery which was just a few hours ago. She is irate that Carlo suspects her of being the killer. But with little evidence to arrest her, Carlo and the others leave.Carlo and the police arrive at the Terzi Institute and search the place for Lori whom Carlo suspects that the killer is one of the doctors, but they find nothing. As Carlo walks on a stairwell, he finds blood on his collar, and he thinks back to the room he just came from. He returns to the room and sees blood dripping from the ceiling. He climbs up to the roof and chases an unseen person. Then the unseen person turns around and it is Casoni who hits him in the face and kicks Carlo to the ground. Casoni, with a stab wound to his stomach, goes to a back room where a gagged Lori is and prepares to stab her. Carlo runs in and tackles the killer, but gets stabbed in the chest. Just then the police arrive on the roof and chase Casoni, but he gets caught by Franco who stops him with his cane blade. Franco asks about Lori, and Casoni (deranged to the last) tells Franco that he killed her. Enraged, Franco swings his cane at Casoni who tries to run and pushes the deranged doctor through a sky window and he falls down an elevator shaft to his death, just as Lori calls out for Franco."

She considers vampirism to be a ""disease"" and that it may be a curable. Seeking out the individual in question, she accidentally discovers, while using a compact mirror, that Barnabas is the vampire (he naturally casts no reflection). She makes a pact with Barnabas and develops a serum to cure him of his blood lust.The cure works for a while, and Barnabas's courtship of Maggie proceeds.

Jeff attempts to shoot Barnabas with a crossbow, while Willie, who is also infatuated with Maggie, rushes over to the altar to stop Barnabas. The arrow that Jeff aims at the obsessed vampire hits Willie in the back. Barnabas pulls the crossbow bolt from Willie's back, then Barnabas takes Jeff under his hypnotic control, simultaneously dropping the crossbow bolt to the floor, next to Willie.

He stumbles upon a pristine valley untouched by the war.There are no people around the village though everything looks to be prosperous. Vogel falls asleep only to be awakened by the arrival of the army from which he was running. He negotiates with The Captain (Caine) for his life explaining that he can talk to both peasant and soldier. The Captain gives him 48 hours to bring the villagers back. the Captain agrees to winter in the valley instead of returning to his army which is starving and plague ridden.The villagers are opposed to having the soldiers stay but soon realize they have no option.

When the Captain wants to destroy the shrine which protects the village he bargains with the head of the village to keep the shrine in exchange for the village providing six women to serve as comfort to the soldiers. Plenty of jealousy and possessiveness ensues as the six women are chosen for this task. The village priest promises that the women will not go to hell for sleeping with the soldiers because they have saved the village.The Captain plays a game of dice for the wife of Gruber (the village leader) and loses, but the wife lies and says he actually won (perhaps because she really prefers the Captain or because she realizes the village will be destroyed if the Captain loses.) When the villagers hear that the shrine is being moved they take up arms to fight the soldiers, but Vogel intercedes and claims he dreamed that the shrine had to be moved to save the village. This pacifies the villagers. Meanwhile conflict over the six comfort women leads to an attempted rape (of Inge) which Vogel prevents and then an attempt on the life of the Captain which is unsuccessful.

tt0065988,"['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Western']","In the present day 1970, 121-year-old Jack Crabb (Dustin Hoffman), the oldest living man in the world, who resides in a hospice, is recounting his long and colorful life story to a curious historian (William Hickey). Among other things, Crabb claims to have been a captive of the Cheyenne, a gunslinger, an associate of Wild Bill Hickok, a scout for General George Armstrong Custer, and the sole white survivor of Custer's force at the 1876 Battle of Little Bighorn. Having been adopted by the Cheyenne and reared in their culture, Crabb tells the Historian that he has perspective on both Caucasian and Native American life in the 19th century.Flashing back to 1859, the 10-year-old Jack and his older sister Caroline (Carole Androsky) survive the massacre of their parents' wagon train by the hostile Pawnee warriors. Found by a Cheyenne warrior, Jack and his sister are taken back to a Cheyenne village. Caroline manages to escape on horseback, but Jack is reared by good-hearted tribal leader Old Lodge Skins (Chief Dan George). Life among the Cheyenne proves to be idyllic, though Jack unwittingly makes an enemy of another boy, Younger Bear (Cal Bellini). However, Younger Bear eventually owes his life to Jack, who saves him from a Pawnee warrior. Jack is given the name ""Little Big Man"" because he's short but very brave.In 1865, when Jack is age 16, he is captured by U.S. cavalry troopers after skirmish between them and the local Cheyenne. Jack then renounces his Native American upbringing in order to save himself from being killed. After his interrogation and debriefing, and being that he is still a minor, Jack is put in the care of Reverend Silas Pendrake (Thayer David) and his sexually frustrated wife, Louise (Faye Dunaway), who tries to seduce Jack. Jack cannot accept the contradiction between Louise's piety and sexual appetite. When Jack finds Louise one day seducing the owner of a local soda shop/pharmacy, he leaves the Pendrake household.A year or so later, Jack becomes the apprentice of the snake-oil salesman Merriweather (Martin Balsam). The two are tarred and feathered when their customers realize that Merriweather's products are fraudulent. One of the angry customers happens to be Jack's sister, Caroline. Once Caroline realizes that one of the men she helped to tar and feather was her brother, they reunite. She attempts to mold her brother into a gunslinger named the Soda Pop Kid (after his favorite beverage). Jack meets Wild Bill Hickok (Jeff Corey) at a saloon, and Hickok takes a liking to the young man. When Hickok is forced to kill a man in self-defense, Jack loses his taste for gun slinging and Caroline deserts him.Another year or two later, Jack becomes a partner in a general store and marries a Swedish woman named Olga (Kelly Jean Peters). Unfortunately, Jack's business partner turns out to be a thieving scoundrel and Jack is forced to close the store. The famous cavalry officer George Armstrong Custer (Richard Mulligan) happens upon the scene and suggests the couple re-start their lives further west.Jack and Olga set out, but their stagecoach is ambushed by Cheyenne hostiles. Olga is abducted and Jack sets out in search for her. During his quest, he is reunited with Old Lodge Skins, who is overjoyed Jack has returned to the tribe. Younger Bear has become a contrary (a warrior who does everything in reverse) and, having been humiliated by Jack years before, is still bitter. After a short stay with the tribe, Jack continues his search for Olga.He eventually becomes a ""muleskinner"" in Custer's 7th Cavalry, hoping to obtain information on Olga's whereabouts. He takes part in a battle against the Cheyenne, but when the 7th troopers begin killing unarmed women and children, Jack becomes enraged and turns on them. Nearby, Jack discovers a Cheyenne woman, Sunshine (Aimée Eccles), giving birth. He saves Sunshine from the marauding troopers and returns with her to Old Lodge Skins's tribe. Sunshine becomes his wife and, the following year, bears him a child of their own. Jack again encounters Younger Bear, who has undergone another life change. No longer a contrary, Younger Bear is now the henpecked husband of the long-lost Olga, who has become a Cheyenne squaw. Olga does not recognize Jack, who makes no attempt to remind her of their previous relationship. Sunshine asks Jack to take in her three widowed sisters as wives and to father children with them. He is reluctant at first, but finally agrees and has sex with all three in succession.One day during the winter season, Custer and the 7th Cavalry make a surprise attack on a Cheyenne camp in Oklahoma (to be known as the Battle of Washita River, which took place on November 27, 1868). A now-blind and elderly Old Lodge Skins is saved by Jack, but Sunshine and their child are killed along with her sisters. Jack tries to infiltrate Custer's camp to exact revenge. At a crucial moment, with knife in hand, Jack loses his nerve, and is mocked by Custer for it.Flashing forward eight years later in 1876, a disheartened Jack has become the town drunk in Deadwood, South Dakota. While in a drunken stupor, he is recognized by Wild Bill Hickok, who gives him money to clean up. When Jack returns to the bar, Hickok is shot and killed. With his last breath, Hickok expresses a dying wish involving a widow he was having an affair with. Jack goes to see the widow, a prostitute who turns out to be Louise Pendrake. Jack gives her the money that Hickok intended for her to use to start a new life.Jack soon becomes a trapper and hermit. His mind becomes unhinged after coming across an empty trap with a severed animal limb. Poised at the edge of a cliff, he prepares to commit suicide. Jack suddenly hears the faint chords of the traditional cavalry tune Garryowen echoing through a valley and spots Custer and his troops marching nearby. Jack decides to exact revenge. Custer, who remembers that Jack once tried to assassinate him, hires him him as a scout, believing anything he says will be a lie, thus serving as a reverse barometer.Jack leads the troops into a trap at the Little Bighorn on June 25, 1876. Before the attack, Jack truthfully tells Custer of the overwhelming force of Native Americans hidden within the valley of the Little Bighorn. The arrogant and overconfident Custer does not believe him and leads the 7th Cavalry to its doom. During the frantic battle, Custer begins to rave insanely while Jack is wounded. Ignoring the closing circle of massed Sioux and Cheyenne warriors, Custer points his pistol at Jack. Before he can pull the trigger, Custer is shot and killed by Younger Bear, who removes the unconscious, wounded Jack from the battle by carrying him to Old Lodge Skins' tepee pretending that he is carrying a fellow warrior. Having thus discharged his life debt, Younger Bear tells Jack that the next time they meet, he can kill Jack without becoming an evil person.Some days later at the Indian camp, the recovering Jack accompanies Old Lodge Skins to a nearby hill, the Indian Burial Ground, where the old man, dressed in full Chief's regalia, has declared ""It is a good day to die"", and decides to end his life with dignity. He offers his spirit to the Great Spirit, and lies down at his spot at the Indian Burial Ground to wait for death. Instead, it begins to rain. Old Lodge Skins is revealed to still be alive, and says, ""Sometimes the magic works, and sometimes it doesn't"". They return to his tepee to have dinner.Back in the present, Jack's narrative abruptly ends and he dismisses the Historian who leaves the room. The film concludes with an extended shot of the elderly Jack sitting in his wheelchair and sadly staring into space.... thinking about the memories of a world which is no more."

tt0066026,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'War']","It's August, 1951, the Korean War. Over the noise of incoming helicopters carrying wounded U.S. soldiers, Colonel Henry Blake (Roger Bowen), the commanding officer of the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (M.A.S.H.), located just three miles from the front lines, is shouting at Corporal Radar O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff), telling him to inform Major Frank Burns (Robert Duvall), that one of the day surgeons will have to stay over on the night shift. He also needs to get word to Brigadier General Charles Hammond (G. Wood), in Seoul, that the 4077th needs two more surgeons, as the patient load is getting overwhelming. Radar says out loud everything Colonel Blake is telling him, but a split before Blake says it. That's the first of many instances where Radar proves always to be one step ahead of his commanding officer. Another enlisted man is trying to write it all down, but misses most of it. Blake tells him that Radar has it.Quotes pertaining to Korea, from both General MacArthur and General Eisenhower, scroll down the screen as Captain Hawkeye Pierce is shown exiting the Officers' Latrine in Seoul and approaching a Jeep for the next leg of his journey. He has just arrived in Korea for duty at the 4077th. He is originally from Maine.The motor pool sergeant (Jerry Jones), struts up to Hawkeye and says, ""What the hell do you think you're doing? Don't think that just because you're a captain, you run this place. I run this place!"" He tells Hawkeye that his driver is having his coffee and will be along when he's ready. Hawkeye, who is in the process of removing his collar devices from his uniform, is shocked and disbelieving about how rude and insubordinate the sergeant is. He mutters ""racist"" to himself as the sergeant walks away (the sergeant is black).Also newly arriving is Captain Duke Forrest (Tom Skerritt). He's from Georgia. He approaches Hawkeye, who is sitting in a Jeep, waiting for the driver. Forrest mistakenly thinks Hawkeye is his driver and, after confirming that the Jeep is headed for the 4077th M.A.S.H. unit, he orders Hawkeye to take him there. Hawkeye says ok, puts the Jeep in gear and roars out of the compound.The motor pool sergeant watches as Hawkeye and Forrest tear out of the place and yells at two military policemen (MPs) to go get them. Something happens to the MPs Jeep, as there's a bang with smoke, and it stops, causing the sergeant to throw a fit and start punching and wrestling with the MPs.Hawkeye & Forrest prove to have a lot in common, in that they are both rebellious, womanizing, and mischievous rule-breakers. They arrive at the Officer's Mess tent at the 4077th and decide to go in for some lunch. They are already making eyes at some nurses. One in particular, Lt. Maria ""Dish"" Schneider (Jo Ann Pflug), attracts their attention and they sit down near her.Colonel Blake asks Captain Murrhardt (Danny Goldman) if he knows those two men who just came in. He does not. Another officer suggests they may be the new doctors, but the Colonel says that can't be, as the two new people are supposed to be really bright. He decides they are just a couple of moochers coming in for a free meal.Forrest is staring at Lt. Schneider and says, ""I think I am in love."" He tells her he's new in town, with nothing to do, and asks her to show him around the place if she's not doing anything tonight. She stays quiet, smiles and holds up her left hand. Hawkeye tells Forrest that the lady is wearing a wedding ring, but he doesn't let that dissuade him.Colonel Blake decides to go see what's up with these new guys. He learns that they are indeed the newest doctors assigned to his unit. The colonel tells Pierce that he'd received a message about him stealing a Jeep at Headquarters. Hawkeye tells the colonel that he didn't steal the Jeep, that it's right outside there. The colonel then sets about informing Forrest about the Army's regulations for proper reporting to a unit. Hawkeye is mostly interested in asking questions about how many people are on staff, especially nurses.The colonel decides to introduce the new captains to the existing staff who are in the mess at that moment. They include the Irish Catholic Chaplain, Father John ""Dago Red"" Mulcahy (Rene Auberjonois); the dental officer, Captain 'Painless Pole' Waldowsky (John Schuck); the anesthesiologist, Captain ""Ugly"" John Black (Carl Gottlieb), a.k.a., the ""gas passer""); Captain Dennis Patrick Bandini (Corey Fischer); and Corporal 'Radar' O'Reilly.Radar tells the captains he will change the identification number on the stolen Jeep, just before Colonel Blake orders him to do that.As Pierce and Forrest proceed with their check in, over near the officer's quarters and barber shop, they walk past a post covered with wooden arrows depicting the mileage and directions to various other cities in the world. Duke lays claim to a pretty blonde nurse who walks past, but after Radar whispers in Hawkeye's ear and Hawkeye in turn whispers in Duke's ear, he realizes that Colonel Blake's girlfriend, Lt. Leslie (Indus Arthur), is ""hands off.""Radar leads them to their tent and inside is Major Frank Burns (Robert Duvall) and a South Korean boy, Ho-Jon (Kim Atwood), who works at the mess hall. Major Burns is teaching Ho Jon how to read, using the Bible. Major Burns will prove to be both a religious man and an inferior surgeon.Captain Forrest slips Ho-Jon a girlie magazine, telling him that it helps when learning how to read to have some pictures to go along with the words. Ho-Jon avoids letting Major Burns see what Forrest gave him and he quickly excuses himself and leaves the tent with the magazine.In the first of many scenes from the M.A.S.H. operating room, the new captains are performing surgeries on two patients. They both have a matter-of-fact attitude as they go about their life and death work, speaking and moving around much like a chef preparing a meal might do. Hawkeye is preparing to saw off a soldier's lower leg while Captain Forrest is hitting on one of the nurses.Frequent announcements come over the camp public announcement (PA) system. They are usually given by SSgt. Wade Douglas Vollmer, (David Arkin), who can't read very well. The first announcement is for all non-commissioned officers to report for a short-arm inspection at 0400. (short-arm inspection refers to the medical inspection of male soldiers' penises, or ""short arm"", for signs of sexually-transmitted diseases and other medical problems).Major Burns enters his tent to find Ho-Jon serving martinis to Pierce and Forrest. Burns lets them know how inappropriate he considers that to be and he grabs his Bible and starts praying. Ho-Jon escapes to go do some laundry. Pierce and Forrest waste no time in starting to tease and mock Major Burns about his obsession with the Bible and religion. They speculate that he suffers from some sort of syndrome and wonder if he's always had it or just since he arrived in Korea. Forrest asks how long ""the show"" is going to last and Burns says that it gets longer all the time, now that he has Forrest's and Pierce's souls to pray for. Hawkeye and Duke start singing, ""Onward Christian Soldiers,"" as Burns keeps on praying. Soon, people outside the tent hear the singing and they join in, marching in a line as they sing.Colonel Blake receives a report from Lt. Leslie about the status of the patients currently at the M.A.S.H. as he sits at his desk tying a fishing fly. Leslie also assists him by handing him various tools that he needs.Hawkeye and Forrest come into the colonel's office and demand that he get the ""Sky Pilot"" Major Burns out of their tent (it's been one week). They also tell Blake that they need to have a ""chest cutter"" (thoracic surgeon) to properly tend to the injured soldiers. Blake tells them he'll have Burns out of their tent within 24 hours, and he'll try his best to get a chest cutter.Colonel Blake seems to empathize with the fact that most of his men and women there at the 4077th are draftees, they have very stressful jobs trying to save lives, and therefore he does very little by way of asserting discipline to keep his staff at the mobile hospital in line with military regulations.Father Mulcahy often hangs around surgery, either to administer last rites, pray, or sometimes assist the doctors. This particular time, he gets called over to administer last rites to a soldier who died on the surgical table, but gets interrupted and is asked by Duke Forrest to come over and hold a surgical retractor being used on another patient. When Mulcahy hesitates, Forrest apologizes, but points out to Dago that the first soldier is dead, while the one they are operating on is still alive.Hawkeye is busy making out with Lt. Dish in the Officer's Club when Ho-Jon comes knocking at the tent door. He tells Hawkeye to come quick, that the new chest cutter has arrived. Hawkeye and the nurse separate, frustrated, but duty calls.Forrest is sitting in his tent with the new chest cutter and complains to Hawkeye that all he has been able to learn is that the new surgeon is from ""Bastin"" (Boston) and has been in the Army for 2 months. As the new doctor is putting up a photo of a pin-up girl, Hawkeye attempts to find out more about him, but the new guy continues be very evasive. As they sit down to have some martinis, and the new doc produces a bottle of green olives from inside his jacket. Hawkeye is amused and impressed. He tells the new man that he looks familiar, but he can't quite place where he knows him from.The new doctor's first operation in surgery attracts a sizable audience, inside and outside the operating room, as everyone is curious as to how he'll do. He does just fine.Other than the frequent PA announcements, Radio Tokyo is often playing throughout the camp, with Japanese announcers and singers providing entertainment in broken English.The staff frequently toss a football around between the tents in the compound and the play can be quite vigorous. One guy performs a flying tackle on the man with the ball, and they both splash down hard into a mud puddle. When the ball flies out of the hands of the man being tackled, it is caught by the new thoracic surgeon. He makes as though to fake a handoff to Duke, then rolls left while Duke runs behind and out the opposite side of a tent, with Hawkeye defending. The new surgeon lobs an off target pass and Hawkeye jumps up and intercepts it. That prompts an immediate recall in Hawkeye's mind. He now knows who the new guy is as he rushes forward, proclaiming it's ""Trapper John McIntyre, former quarterback for Dartmouth University. Hawkeye played in a game for Androscoggin College, against Dartmouth and McIntyre, and he intercepted a pass thrown by Trapper John, enabling Androscoggin to win the game, 6-0.Hawkeye also tells Duke that Trapper got his nickname as a result of cornering a girl in the restroom of a railroad car, and when the conductor caught them in there, the girl screamed, ""He trapped me!'The enlisted all line up outside the shower tent to get a peek at Dr. Captain ""Painless Pole"" Waldowsky as he's showering. The attraction is the captain's sexual apparatus, which is apparently of unusually large proportions. Corporal Judson, from Mississippi, takes his turn at the peephole. As he walks away, he says to a shocked looking Private Lorenzo Boone (Bud Cort), ""Ah'd purely love to see that angry!""A small group, led by Colonel Blake (in his civilian winter coat), goes out to meet an incoming helicopter. On board is Major Margaret Houlihan (Sally Kellerman), the new Chief Nurse for the 4077th.Major Burns is tending to a male patient who suddenly goes into cardiac arrest. Burns calls for a nurse and proceeds to do a couple of unenthusiastic thumps on the patient's chest. When there's no nurse at hand, he directs Private Boone, who's just a teenage orderly, to go grab a cardiac needle and some adrenaline. Boone is hesitant, as he's not sure where to find those things, but he tries. The soldier dies right about then, and when Boone returns with a regular needle and hands it to Burns, Burns calls him an idiot and tells him he wanted a cardiac needle. Boone asks Burns if he wants him to get a nurse and Burns says, ""it's too late, Boone, you killed him."" Boone feels horrible and goes away in tears. Trapper observes all this and a short while later he approaches Burns and asks him if he's done for the day. When Burns says yes, Trapper says, ""good, I just wanted to make sure you'll have time to sleep this off,"" and he lands a haymaker right hand across Burns' head. Burns crashes into some boxes of Tampax while Trapper grimaces in pain as he grips his right hand with his left. At the same moment, Colonel Blake and Major Houlihan pass by and are shocked at what they witness. They demand to know what's going on. Burns asks for them to leave he and Trapper alone and let them settle things, but Blake tells SSgt. Vollmer to arrest Trapper and confine him to his quarters.Before happening on the fight between Trapper and Burns, Blake had introduced Major Houlihan (he called her ""O'Houlihan"") to the people in the operating room. Among those there are Captain Dana Murrhardt (Danny Goldman), Captain Black, Captain Judson Sax, Captain Scorch (Dawne Damon), and Captain Bridget ""Knocko"" McCarthy (Tamara Wilcox-Smith).Henry wants to make Trapper the head surgeon, but feels the fight with Major Burns necessitates that he wait for a week or the new chief nurse will likely make a stink about it.Blake and Lt. Leslie are out on a small stream near camp and he's flycasting. Vollmer runs up to inform the colonel that General Hammond can't answer the phone as he's at a football game. Blake complains that the generals have all the fun.Margaret joins Hawkeye at his table in the mess tent. He asks her where she's from and she tells him she likes to think of the Army as her home. She then asks Hawkeye how he likes the nurses who work on his team. He tells her he likes them fine. She tells him that Major Burns does not think much of the nurses, to which Hawkeye responds that Burns is a lousy surgeon and an idiot. Margaret strongly disagrees. She thinks Burns is a fine doctor and military man. Margaret also think it's very unprofessional that people call Captain Pierce, ""Hawkeye."" Hawkeye tells Major Houlihan that she's what he and others call ""a typical, uptight, career Army clown,"" as he loses his appetite and gets up to go to his tent.On occasion, the lights in the operating room go out. When that happens, several enlisted staff position themselves with flashlights so the doctors can keep working. In one instance, the doctors and nurses started singing ""When the Lights Go On Again,"" a song written in 1942, during WWII.Blake leaves the camp overnight to go see General Hammond over at the 325th Evac Hospital and he leaves Major Burns in charge. There's a big party in the mess tent for Trapper, to celebrate his being named the camp's new chief surgeon. Margaret and Frank are not impressed, especially when Trapper calls out for Margaret, the ""sultry bitch"" to be stripped of her clothes and brought to him for sex.Frank and Margaret collaborate on a typewritten letter to General Hammond, complaining about the lack of discipline and order at the 4077th. After they finish, Frank notes that it's dinnertime and Margaret asks if he's hungry. ""For you, Margaret,"" and they attack each other with passion and engage in a dry hump, but only briefly.There's a PA announcement that three cases of amphetamine sulfate (central nervous system stimulant) have disappeared and this is the third time this sort of thing has happened in the last month and it must stop by order of Colonel Blake's office. Burns escorts Margaret to her tent and offers to stop by and check on her later. She says that won't be necessary but she also says she'll leave the door unlocked. When he comes by later, they exchange empathy with one another for how poorly the others in camp treat them, and how disrespectful they are. Frank then says he thinks God willed them to find each other. Margaret throws open her pajama top, exposing her breasts and says, ""His will be done,"" and Frank plants his face on her breasts and they fall onto the bed. As they struggle to get their clothes off, Radar lifts up the bottom of the tent and places the microphone to the camp's PA system under the bed. At first, the sounds are transmitted only to location of the PA equipment in Henry Blake's office, where a handful of people are listening in. Trapper then decides the rest of the camp should hear it and an enlisted man flips a switch to broadcast it.Margaret is panting and tells Frank that her lips are hot, asking him to kiss her hot lips. Hawkeye, busy doing surgery, wonders what those sounds are and soon figures it out. He says, ""it sounds like Frank Burns is doing a bit of dilitation and curretage."" Before long, Margaret can hear her own voice over the PA system and that quickly brings the lovemaking session to an end.The next morning in the mess tent, Forrest says, ""well, hi, Hot Lips,"" as she gets all flustered and has to leave the tent. Hawkeye sits down across the table from Frank and taunts Frank by asking if he'd heard from his wife. About then, Colonel Blake returns to camp and Radar directs him over to the window of the mess tent, behind where Hawkeye and Burns are sitting. Blake peers in and it warms his heart to see the two finally sitting down together to have a talk.Hawkeye says to Frank that he and the other guys wonder how Hot Lips is in the sack, ""is she better than self-abuse?"" He asks Frank, ""does that big ass of her move around a lot, or does it just sort of lie there, flaccid? What would you say about that?""Blake wonders what they are saying. Radar looks and says Hawkeye is making a point about human anatomy. Blake is impressed at how professional the conversation is, how they are exchanging ideas.After Hawkeye asks if Hot Lips is a moaner or does she just lie there quietly, Frank launches himself across the table at Hawkeye and they fall to the ground, Hawkeye yelling for help. As they struggle, Trapper tells Hawkeye to look out for his goodies, as Frank is a sex maniac and he didn't think Hot Lips satisfied him. Several others in the area hurry to pull Frank off Hawkeye. Frank is put in a strait jacket and taken away by the MPs as Father Mulcahy attempts to read to him from a small scripture book. Frank won't be coming back, he's being shipped back to the states. Duke asks the colonel if he nails Hot Lips and punches Hawkeye, can he go home?In surgery, Hawkeye has to move quickly to stop a soldier's spurting neck artery, as an announcement comes over the PA system about the American Medical Association declaring marijuana to be a dangerous drug.Father Mulcahy tells Hawkeye that ""Painless Pole"" Waldowski has consulted him about a problem. Though Mulcahy feels unable to divulge any details (Waldowski had come to him in confession), he makes clear the severity of the problem. by explaining to Hawkeye that when one of the men asked for a ruling in the poker game they were playing, the captain said, ""what does it matter, it's only a game?"" Hawkeye wastes no time in going over to see Waldowski in his tent.Waldowski confides in Hawkeye that he has suffered a ""lack of performance"" (impotence) with a visiting nurse after a sexual encounter. He tells Hawkeye that he's distraught over how he will ever be able to tell his three fiancées back home. Hawkeye tells Waldowski that occasional impotence is not a problem, and nothing for the ""dental Don Juan"" of Detroit to worry about. Waldowski tells Hawkeye that he's been reading up on it and Don Juanism is just a cover up. He thinks he's a fairy, a victim of latent homosexuality, and he can't deal with it.The next day, the other doctors are sitting around joking about Waldoski's concerns. He enters the tent as they smirk and giggle and tells them all he knows they were talking about him. He announces that he's going to commit suicide. Bandidi jokingly asks Waldoski if he can have his record player. He says sure. Then he asks for suggestions about how best to go about killing himself. Trapper says, ""the black capsule,"" which is what Adolph Hitler and Eva Braun used. Trapper claims to be able to provide a capsule for him.Hawkeye asks Father Mulcahy to perform last rites for Waldoski . He's hoping that if they conduct an end of life ceremony for him, he'll get scared and decide he wants to live. The doctors, administrative officers, chopper pilots and enlisted men all form up for the ceremony, a replica of the Last Supper, with a coffin placed in front of the table. Someone plays a scratchy version of ""Taps"" on a violin. Dago Red performs a quick absolution and Trapper gives a black capsule (actually a sleeping pill) to Waldoski. Waldoski figures that he'd better go lie down in the coffin, since the pill is supposed to work pretty fast. He gets in and immediately swallows the capsule with some wine. Everyone one files by to say goodbyes or leave little mementos with Waldoski. Among the items presented to him are some poker cards, a fifth of scotch, some basic dental instruments and the photographs of his three fiancées. Finally, he goes to sleep as Corporal Judson (Timothy Brown) sings ""Suicide is Painless.""A group of men carry the coffin to the Officer's Club and Waldoski is placed in a bed, complete with mood lighting. Hawkeye is outside making out with Lt. Schneider, who is scheduled to transfer out within 12 hours. Hawkeye asks her to do him a favor, to meet her professional obligations as a nurse, and go in and lie down with Waldoski, to help him with a potentially fatal psychological condition. She's not wanting to do it, but once she lifts up the edge of the sheet and sees what Waldoski has down below, she changes her mind.Captain Waldoski was in a very good mood the next morning, a new and improved man, seemingly having forgotten he supposedly had died the night before, and Lt. Schneider flew out on a helicopter, with a big smile on her face.Hawkeye and Trapper need some A-negative blood for a Korean prisoner of war with a chest wound they are operating on, but Radar said their requests for A-negative blood are never fulfilled. The operation proceeds and Radar goes to see a sleeping Colonel Blake. Radar sits next to the bed and monitors a tube extending from Blake's arm. A pint of blood is harvested from the colonel while he's sleeping (he's obviously type A-). Radar delivers a pint of blood to the operating room just as the surgeons were about to be forced to go on without it, at great risk to the patient.During the operation, Trapper is being assisted by Margaret and he says, ""Hot Lips, you may be a pain in the ass, but you're a damn good nurse.""Captain Forrest likes blondes, but strongly disagrees with Hawkeye who speculates that Duke is attracted to Hot Lips. Duke says he nearly pukes every time he sees Hot Lips. He thinks she's probably not even a true blonde and decides to bet Hawkeye $20 that she isn't. They conspire on a plan to isolate Hot Lips in the women's shower and then expose her so they can see what color her pubic hair is. Everyone in the camp, including a dog, take seats outside the shower tent and when they are ready, Waldoski clangs two metal lids together and a soldier releases a sandbag connected to some ropes and the sides of the tent all fly up. Hot Lips had been singing in the shower, but when she discovers everyone is looking at her, she screams and falls to the ground, covering herself. She crawls over and gets a towel and, in hysterics, she storms off to see Colonel Blake. She's furious as she tears open the door to the Colonel's tent and finds him inside, lying in bed with Lt. Leslie. She screams at him that the camp is an insane asylum and that it's his fault for letting the doctors get away with practically anything. She threatens to resign her commission if Blake doesn't turn Duke and Hawkeye over to the MPs. Blake listens and becomes angry, telling Houlihan, ""Goddamit Hot Lips, resign your goddamn commission!"" Houlihan dejectedly turns and leaves, sobbing ""My commission, my commission.....""Duke won the bet with Hawkeye. Margaret was not a natural blonde.Ho-Jon receives notice to report for an induction physical for the South Korean Army. Hawkeye, along with fellow co-workers Boone, Bandini, and Nurse Scorch, drive him to the induction center in Seoul for his physical. Hawkeye dopes him up with some drugs that temporarily give him a fast heart beat and high blood pressure. The doctor examining him is at first concerned, then figures out what's going on. He goes outside and informs Hawkeye that he will be keeping Ho Jon for a couple of days and retesting him. He says to Hawkeye, ""nice try."" Hawkeye reluctantly has to let Ho-Jon go.A helicopter pilot arrives at the 4077th, looking for Captain McIntyre. A soldier who'd been doing some training in Japan was accidentally wounded when a grenade went off and some shrapnel got into his heart. Some big time heart surgeon in Boston told the kid's father, a Congressman, that Trapper John was the only surgeon in the theater who might be able to save his boy. Trapper is ordered to proceed to Kokura, Japan, to do the operation. After looking at the x-rays, Trapper realizes that just about anyone could remove the shrapnel, as it's not threatening the boy's heart, but he decides there's a free trip to Tokyo in the offing, plus General Hammond said in the orders to Trapper that he could bring an assistant, so he invites Hawkeye. They view it as an opportunity to do some golfing.Trapper and Hawkeye are driven past a golf course on their way to the hospital in Japan and they are pretending to be speaking Japanese. Their driver is Sgt. Gorman (Bobby Troupe), who doesn't view the task of escorting these two as appropriate to his skill set and he curses the army.At the hospital, the pair waste no time in upsetting just about every person they come into contact with, both medical and non-medical staff alike, as they order the congressman's son into surgery. Trapper tells Captain Peterson (Cathleen Cordell) to prepare the patient and find him a nurse who can work in close without getting her tits in the way. They are equally disrespectful to the straight-laced commander of the hospital, Colonel Wallace C. Merrill (James B. Douglas), ordering him to leave the operating room when he comes in to criticize their behavior.When the anesthetist for the operation, Captain E.B. ""Me Lay"" Marston (Michael Murphy), tells Hawkeye to save his rapier like wit for the clam diggers back home, Hawkeye suddenly recognizes it's an old acquaintance of his. Hawkeye had once told Trapper John how one of his friend's back home got the nick-name ""Me Lay"" by saying to girls, ""Me lay, you lay,"" and it would enable him to score with about 1 of every 50 of the girls.Trapper and Hawkeye quickly finish the surgery, but on the way out of the hospital, they are followed by two MPs. They think they are escaping through a door, but when they close it and turn around, they find themselves in the Colonel Merrill's outer office, where another MP is sitting and waiting for them. They are directed into Colonel Merrill's office to wait for him to appear. They still have their golf clubs with them, so they take advantage of the wait by practicing their putting.When Colonel Merrill comes in, he threatens to have Hawkeye and Trapper court martialed. They remind him that they bailed him out with the Congressman by operating on his son and if Merrill decides to press the matter, they will call and tell the Congressman their side of the story and the colonel can tell his side. They tell the colonel they will hang around one more day to golf and check on the Congressman's son, and he can contact them at the golf course if he wants them. Then Hawkeye uses the butt end of his putter to push the colonel back into his chair and off they go.Dr. Marston invites Hawkeye and Trapper to come check out Dr. Yamachi's New Era Hospital and Whorehouse, where Marston moonlights as a doctor. As the three later sit with some Geisha girls and eat a meal at the facility, a nurse comes in and speaks with Me Lay, telling him that a Japanese-American baby boy was having trouble breathing and needed help. Based only on a description of the symptoms, Trapper and Hawkeye decide to schedule surgery for the boy back at the Army hospital. Hawkeye has already diagnosed the problem as a tracheal-esophageal fistula. He tells Dr. Marston not to tell the hospital who the surgery is for, because it is against the rules. However, when Colonel Merrill finds out what's going on, he comes into the operating room and throws a fit, prompting the doctors to clamp a surgical gas mask over his face and put him to sleep, then they complete the operation on the child.While the Colonel is still asleep, one of the Geisha girls, Michiko (Hiroko Watanabe) is put with him in a bed and some compromising photos are taken to assure that the Colonel will remain quiet about everything that had transpired.On their return to the 4077th from Japan, Hawkeye and Trapper (still wearing their newly purchased golf attire) immediately go into surgery for several hours. Finally with a chance to go their tent, now nicknamed ""The Swamp,"" they find the flaps on the windows down and the door locked so they bang on the door. Duke's face appears at the window and he wants to know what the hell they are doing back already. He tells them to wait a minute. Hawkeye and Trapper figure something's up, so they start around towards the back of the tent and see a shirtless Forrest trying to smuggle Hot Lips away under a blanket. When the blanket falls off, they say hello to Hot Lips and ask her if she missed them. As she scurries away, Duke just looks at Trapper and Hawkeye and shrugs. Apparently non-blondes are ok with him after all.General Hammond calls Colonel Blake to tell him the battle for Old Baldy was all over (the battle that was responsible for so many wounded). He ignores Henry's inquiry as to who won, instead telling him he got a rather disturbing report from Major ""O'Houlihan"" about things taking place at the 4077th that he finds hard to believe. Blake says, ""well, don't believe them then...goodbye"" and he hangs up the phone.General Hammond makes a trip over to the 4077th to check on things for himself. The first thing he does is join the surgeons out under a camouflage net for some martinis. They discuss Major Houlihan. Trapper tells the general that Colonel Blake can't be blamed for Hot Lips not being able to stand her name. When Hawkeye tells the general that Hot Lips is a regular Army fanatic who won't even let them play football, that gets the general's attention, as he loves football. He asks if the 4077th has a football team. Hawkeye starts to say no, but Trapper John interjects and says yes. Hammond mentions that his team at the 325th Evac (he's the head coach) is currently scheduling games for the upcoming season. They like to play games against other units and bet on the outcomes. When he says the bets are typically in the $5,000-$6,000 range, Hawkeye nearly chokes, but the general has already decided to go speak with Colonel Blake about it.Trapper observes that the general has five times the manpower to draw his football players from. Hawkeye thinks they can deal with that by finding a ""ringer"" to help them. He knows an Army neurosurgeon named Oliver Harmon Jones, a.k.a. ""Spearchucker"" who used to play for the San Francisco 49ers. If they can get Henry to put in a special request for Dr. Jones, then he could be on their football team. Forrest, being from Georgia, is concerned about potential social problems, as Jone's would be the only black officer in camp. Hawkeye tells Duke they'd just stick him in the Swamp with them.The general goes to see Blake and tell him about the football game plan. Henry is taken aback. ""Football? Gambling? What about Houlihan?"" The general says, ""ya mean Hot Lips? Screw her!""So, ""Spearchucker"" (a nickname from his days as a javelin thrower) shows up at the 4077th and Colonel Blake assumes the role as head coach. He organizes the first practice and just as he's beginning his first coaching lesson (about the three basic principles of football: organization, discipline and teamwork), Dr. Jones interrupts and asks if they can all limber up first. Henry decides that's a good idea and asks Spearchucker to organize that.The team is put through a pretty rigorous training camp, just like any normal football team would go through. Hot Lips also participates by organizing a squad of nurses as cheerleaders.Trapper is the team's quarterback. Spearchucker is a running back. Spearchucker presents Colonel Blake with seven or eight plays that he drew up, telling the coach that he figured that's about the maximum number of plays their team could handle.As for the bet, Hawkeye suggests they bet $2,500 on the first half, in which Spearchucker won't play, then get new odds for the 2nd half and put Spearchucker in. Everyone agrees that's a good idea.On game day, the 325th Evac team is dressed in blue uniforms and the 4077th M.A.S.H. is in red jerseys and white helmets with red crosses on the front and back. The field is well manicured green grass and well marked. The referees are very official looking. There are cheerleaders for both teams and bleachers on one side of the field, filled with spectators.The 4077th kicks off and a flashy little runner for the 325th returns the ball for a touchdown. Spearchucker knows him as ""Super Bug"" (Noland Smith) and tells the others that Super Bug played for the L.A. Rams. Spearchucker tells his teammates they have to get Super Bug out of the game. Meanwhile, the general is telling his defensive star, a huge lineman, #88 (Ben Davidson) to go easy on the 4077th players so as not to run up the score.The 4077th's first play from scrimmage sees the ball snapped way over Trapper's head and he falls on it in the end zone for a safety.Radar serves as the water boy. He brings out a syringe and hands it to anesthesiologist Black who tucks it into his belt. After Super Bug returns the next kickoff for another touchdown, Dr. Black injects him in the arm, even using an alcohol swab first, while he's still on the ground. Within seconds, Super Bug becomes disoriented and falls down. On the sideline, he starts talking about the next race. He thinks they are all participating in a track meet.The ""Painless Pole"" tells the huge player opposite him, ""All right, Bud, this time your fucking head is coming right off!"" but he's the one who gets hammered.It's 16-0 at halftime and when the gun goes off signaling the end of the half, Super Bug mistakes it for a starter's gun and takes off in a sprint and runs into his team's cheerleaders, knocking them all over.Henry begins a rallying halftime speech when Hawkeye reminds him that he needs to go take care of the second half bet with General Hammond, so Blake stops talking and he and Radar go over to the 325th's locker room.The 325th's #88 takes a big mouthful of water and purposely directs a stream of water at Radar's head as they sit around observing the colonel and general discuss terms of the bet. Radar just looks like a sad little puppy dog as he is forced to suffer through the insult.The general and colonel decide to double the bet for the 2nd half.Spearchucker enters the game for the 4077th and returns the 2nd half kickoff for a touchdown. The extra point attempt is blocked. The general demands to know who the that new guy is and one of the players on the 325th tells him it's Spearchucker Jones who played for the 49ers. The general yells at Blake from across the field, accusing him of bringing in a ringer. Blake couldn't make out what the general said, so he asks Radar. Radar says, ""His ringer identified our ringer."" Blake shouts back, ""How do ya like them apples, Charlie?""The second half is brutal, as numerous players from both side are injured and carted off the field. Several 325th Evac players are sharing a marijuana joint on the bench during the game. The general occasionally gets distracted looking at his team's cheerleaders.The 4077th cheerleaders stand right behind Colonel Blake throughout the game and he often gets frustrated with them. He once yells at Hot Lips, calling her a ""blithering idiot"" because she's cheering for everything that happens: injuries and penalties, as well as scores or good plays. When the gun goes off at the end of the third quarter, at the same time a 4077th player is being tackled, Hot Lips shouts out, ""oh, my God, they shot him!""Blue team's #88 calls the 4077th's #69 a ""coon,"" as he's black. #69 wants to fight #88, but gets chastised by Spearchucker for risking a penalty and ejection. Spearchucker knows something about #88 from pro football camp, so he advises #69 to use the fact that #88 has a sister named Gladys to turn the tables and piss him off instead. So, before the snap of the ball on the next play, #69 says something, causing #88 to level him. #69 jumps up and runs the opposite direction, with #88 in hot pursuit. They run all the way down the field before the refs and other catch up to them. #88 is ejected from the game as the 4077th cheerleaders start chanting, ""69 is divine.""The 4077th scores on a TD pass, but the extra point is muffed. The score is 16-12. It comes down to the last play of the game. Spearchucker tells the team that he spoke with the umpire and they will run a special ""center eligible"" play, where the center, SSgt. Vollmer, will hike the ball to Trapper, but then bring the ball right back between his legs and tuck it under his shirt as Trapper and the rest of the players carry out a fake. The play works, even after Vollmer runs over to the sideline to show Coach Blake that he actually has the ball, then he continues on down the sideline and, thanks to a block from Spearchucker, scores a touchdown. Final score: 4077th - 18, 325th -16.The 4077th team rolls back into camp, all drunk. Later, there's a big poker game in a tent and in the background a dead soldier is being loaded into the back of a Jeep and taken away, bringing the reality of their situation back in focus.There's a little yellow camp dog that Hawkeye often plays with. He calls it ""pup-pup."" He's petting the dog when he receives word from Radar that prompts him to rush over to the operating room and inform Forrest that they both had received orders to go home. Forrest can't celebrate right away, as he's assisting Dr. Jones in brain surgery.Father Mulcahy blesses the Jeep that Forrest and Hawkeye will leave in. After some quick goodbyes, Duke and Hawkeye jump in a Jeep, and just as when they arrived in Korea, they don't wait for their designated driver. Hawkeye drives and they roar out of camp. Blake asks Radar if Hawkeye just stole that Jeep and Radar says no, that it's the same Jeep they arrived in.The PA Announcer reads the end credits as the movie ends."

tt0066206,"['Biography', 'Drama', 'War']","Against a backdrop of the Stars and Stripes, General George S. Patton (George C. Scott) addresses his troops on the eve of battle. His uniform is impeccable, his medals uncountable, and his ramrod demeanor unassailable. As he speaks to the men about to embark on their first great adventure, his manner runs the gamut from stern, to jovial, amused, profane and reverent. To Patton, it is obvious that war is the greatest expression of the human condition.North Africa, 1942: In their first encounter with Rommel's Africa Corps, the Americans are badly beaten. In the post-battle assessment, Gen. Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) decides what's needed is the best tank commander they've got. Patton answers the call and arrives amid wailing sirens and a cloud of dust. He's also early and catches most of the soldiers off guard, a mistake they quickly learn not to make again. Believing the casual attitude displayed by the troops to be the primary source of their defeat, he quickly begins to set things to rights. Patton's belief in himself is unshakable, and there's only one way to get things done-his way. Quickly establishing discipline and routine, he commands his men with an iron fist. He also has great respect for the Germans he's up against, and has studied the tactics of Rommel in the field.In Berlin, the Germans are also assessing Patton. His reputation is considerable, and they study his idiosyncracies looking for a clue to the man's character. They note he is a romantic, reads the Bible daily, swears like a stableboy, and believes in reincarnation. Rommel, when asked what he intends to do about Patton, simply replies ""I will attack and annihilate him.....before he does the same to me.""Soon the Germans move against the American positions in Tunisia, and Patton watches in fascination from his command post in the hills nearby. Anticipating Rommel's plan, he routs the Germans, and gives the Americans their first victory, further inflating his ego. North Africa now has two prima donnas; Patton, and the equally egotistical British commander, Field Marshal Montgomery (Michael Bates). Naturally, they come to dislike each other intensely, and as the African campaign draws to a close, plans are made for the invasion of Italy. Patton wines and dines the appropriate officals, and pitches his own plan to invade through Sicily. Montgomery has other plans, and when Monty's are adopted over his own, Patton, outraged, vows to outdo the Field Marshal at all costs.Sicily is invaded, and Montgomery's troops fight their way up the East coast against heavy German resistance. Patton is assigned the support role of guarding Montomery's flank, but soon adopts another plan and begins to push across the island, taking the long way around. First taking Palermo, then pushing East to Messina, he races Montgomery to the finish line, pushing his men to the breaking point and creating dissension among his commanders. They do not wish to sacrifice more American casualties to Patton's ego.Soon, Montgomery and the British forces march into the liberated city of Messina amid the cheering populace. Flags wave and the pipers play as they march triumphantly into the town square; Monty has done it. He's driven the Germans out of Sicily and beaten Patton to the punch. Abruptly, the pipers falter, and fall silent. Monty quickly marches to the fore to investigate, and finds Patton, his tanks and troops neatly arrayed behind him, standing there silently with an insufferable smile on his lips. He'd arrived hours ago, and was waiting only to greet his old rival.As the Italian campaign continues, Patton becomes more controversial. During a routine inspection of wounded men in a field hospital, he encounters a shell-shocked soldier crying in a corner and becomes enraged with what he perceives as a display of cowardice. Slapping the soldier, he rages at him and orders him sent back to the front. This outburst gets Patton the first serious setback he's ever experienced. A rebuke from his commander and an order to apologize to all concerned quickly follow, a bitter pill indeed for the general. Forced to swallow his pride, he stands before the assembled troops and tersely gives his explanation, then turns on his heel and marches away.The war grinds on. Patton is called to England prior to D-Day, and believes he will be commanding the invasion, but finds that his big mouth and bigger ego have gotten him into too much trouble. He's become a liability to the fragile alliance Eisenhower is trying to hold together to fight the Germans, so Patton's orders are to shut up and stay out of trouble. Chafing at what may be his last chance to be in a great battle, he'll do anything to get back in the game. Arriving in France days after the invasion, he meets with General Bradley again, who puts Patton on probation and gives him a chance to redeem himself. Grateful for the opportunity, Patton quickly shows the rest of the world what he can do, chasing the Germans clear across France, and gaining more ground in less time than any other allied outfit.Christmas approaches, and the Germans mount a final major counter-attack at the Battle of the Bulge. Caught off guard, the American troops are trapped and surrounded, and only a miracle can save them. Patton vows to provide one. Marching his men north at breakneck speed, he amazingly arrives in time and relieves the trapped Americans, grabbing the limelight once more. Now it's on to Germany, and as the war winds down, Patton becomes despondent at the impending cessation of hostilities. All too soon, Patton's mouth gets him in trouble again as he first snubs the Russians, and then compares the defeated Nazis to other political parties in the U.S. Another uproar ensues, and Eisenhower is forced to relieve Patton once again.Having proved himself one of the greatest military commanders of WWII, he now faces a future and a world that no longer need him. Recalling history, he ruminates: ""For over a thousand years, Roman conquerors returning from the wars enjoyed the honor of a triumph - a tumultuous parade. The conqueror rode in a triumphal chariot, the dazed prisoners walking in chains before him. Sometimes his children, robed in white, stood with him in the chariot, or rode the trace horses. A slave stood behind the conqueror, holding a golden crown, and whispering in his ear a warning: that all glory is fleeting."""
tt0066214,"['Crime', 'Drama']","Here it is for anyone who has often thought about what this movie is about. The first half hour or so is violence and general London villainy, until Chas arrives at the hippy house of Turner in Notting Hill Gate. Chas settles into his basement accommodation and participates in the magic mushroom fests that Turner provides.The movie begins its real plot at the the clip in the bedroom: 'Turner has been waiting for you for a long time' (immediately before Turner goes down the channel of Jorge Luis Borges into transformation as the Chairman of the Board where he says 'I like that, turn it up' and then sings the famous Performance song 'Memo from Turner'.)'Poor White Hound Dog' is sung here by Merry Clayton. Turner has lost his demon. OK, so far so good. And he's trying to decide whether he wants to get it back again. OK. Chas has Turner's demon and Turner knows this - that's the bottom line in this movie - and the plot is about the psychological morphing of Turner to become Chas - there is a further, secondary transformation of Turner in the bedroom, just before the end of the movie, where Turner says 'I want to come with you' and Chas says 'You don't know where I'm going, Pal' to which Turner replies 'I do'. He then realises the significance of what he has said and hides his face beneath the bedspread, saying 'No I don't' before Chas confirms the transaction with a 'Yeah you do', cocks his automatic and shoots Turner. The camera follows the bullet's path through Turner's head, ending with a brief portrait of Borges before exiting with an exterior shot of Chas/Turner being walked to Harry Flowers's Rolls Royce in a stunning transition.This is the point where Turner BECOMES Chas and that's why Jagger is in the Rolls Royce at the end of the movie - that is to say - the morphing transformation is complete - the demon has been found, identified and appropriated. Borges couldn't have written this story any better than the author of the book (William Hughes) and you may have noticed the book 'A Personal Anthology' by Jorge Luis Borges, twice in this movie, once when Rosie (the gangster) is reading it in the boardroom and the second time when Turner is reading from it ('The South') when he quotes 'They would not have allowed such things to happen to me in the sanitarium' before the book flies across the room onto the floor. Mm, well quite, mate."
tt0066249,"['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Crime', 'Mystery', 'Romance', 'Thriller']","A dusty box is opened at a lawyers offices, fifty years after being sealed. The box contains Sherlock Holmes memorabilia, such as his cap, his pipe, his magnifying glass, a plaque with the number 221B, a hypodermic needle. Also in the box is a manuscript written by Dr. Watson. It records cases to be suppressed for fifty years because of their controversial [e.g. sexual] content or circumstances. The screen transitions back in time...Sherlock Holmes (Robert Stephens) and Dr. Watson (Colin Blakely) are in their rooms at 221B Baker Street. Holmes complains he is bored, as he has no cases to work on, saying he needs a shot of 5% cocaine. Watson says, ""Seven per cent"", Holmes says he knows Watson disapproves and has been covertly diluting the solution.Holmes, in a bad mood, complains that Watson's case histories, published in The Strand Magazine, exaggerate and embellish and are more lurid than reality. For example, he is barely six foot one, and Watson wrote that he is six foot four. Watson replies ""Poetic license, Holmes!"".Still in a foul mood, Holmes yells at landlady Mrs. Hudson (Irene Handl) for dusting stuff on his desk. Later he has the rooms thick with smoke from using a machine to artificially smoke various cigarettes, as part of his research on cigarette ashes.Watson suggests that he might consider investigating why six acrobatic midgets disappeared from their circus act, as a recent newspaper reports, but he is rebuffed. The next suggestion is that they go to a performance of a Russian ballet, since someone anonymously has sent them two expensive tickets.At the end of the ballet, the impresario (Clive Revill) invites Holmes, and reluctantly, Watson, to a staff party. Watson parties with the dancers, while Holmes is led to the dressing room of star ballerina Madame Petrova (Tamara Toumanova). Petrova, speaking Russian, offers Holmes a Stradivarius violin in exchange for sex leading to her conceiving a child that might inherit her beauty and his intellect. Petrova says she has read The Hound of the Baskervilles, and also that he was not her first choice, but Tolstoy was too old to function, and Tchaikowski turned out to be not interested in women.Holmes turns her down as delicately as he can, claiming that he and Watson are lovers who are not interested in women either. Petrova angrily throws him out.Meanwhile Watson has been drinking, dancing a riotous storm arm in arm in a circle of beautiful ballerinas. The impresario whispers to one girl that Watson is homosexual, the news is spread from ear to ear, and the girls in the dancing circle are replaced by male dancers one by one. Watson, drunk, wearing a flower behind his ear, finally asks, ""What happened to the girls?"" and is led off to Baker Street by Holmes.Watson berates Holmes for what he said, surmising that the rumour would never die off, particularly because Holmes is not known to have had any relations with women, whereas Watson has been married. Holmes says he wanted to spare Madame Petrova's feelings, doesn't care to have a reputation with women. Watson asked if he would be presumptious to presume Holmes had had affairs with women. Holmes says ""You are being presumptuous"" as he goes into his room.Soon after, a cabbie rings at the door and wants to be paid. He fished a nearly drowned woman (Geneviève Page) out of the river, in shock, clutching a card with the Baker street address on it. As the cabbie leaves, a mysterious looking older man has been watching from a carriage in the street.Watson convinces Holmes to take a look at her. She has received a blow on the head and is barely conscious. Holmes inspects her shoes and labels on her dress that indicate she is from Brussels. The card she was clutching is illegible from getting wet, but some ink has rubbed on her palm and Holmes reads the number 130 by looking at the mirror image. She is wearing a wedding ring with the names Gabrielle and Emil, but she appears too dazed to give information, although she speaks French. Watson volunteers his bed and sleeps on the couch, and Mrs. Hudson helps her to Watson's bedroom.Not long after, Gabrielle gets up from the bed (totally naked, of course, since Mrs. Hudson is drying her clothes) but still confused. She goes to Holmes talking to him as though he were her beloved husband Emil, whom she has found at last, holding onto him with passion. She retreats to Sherlock Holmes' bed where he sees on her beckoning hands the letters he could not read from the cardboard piece he had found in her hand when they first meet. He views the lettering, deduced from her baggage, on her palm, she in apparent alarm, viewed with a mirror.The next morning, Mrs. Hudson arrives with breakfast and is Victorianly horrified to see the naked woman on Holmes' bed. Holmes enters from the street carrying a trunk and a fancy parasol. He recognized the wet card as a possible check stub, and since she was Belgian she would have come on the boat train from the Continent and checked her things at Victoria Station. They break into her trunk and find her last name is Valladon.When Gabrielle wakes, she is better and tells her story. Her husband was working in London and wrote to her often and regularly until a few weeks ago. He is an engineer by profession and said his employer was Jonah. She wrote to him at an address she remembers. She begs Holmes to find her missing husband. Quick research shows there is no English company with that name, and that the address is an abandoned building. Holmes has her write a letter to the address, planning to go spy there the next day and see who picks up the letter. In between these comings and goings, the mysterious older man on a cab is again on the street, and sees Gabrielle's parasol open and close, whereupon he departs.The next day they break into the abandoned building, where they find a cage full of canaries and mysterious tracks but no footprints. They hide as a postman drops a letter in the slot, see an old lady in a wheelchair come feed the canaries from the alley, and porters who come pick up a load of canaries. The letter is left behind, and when they see it, it is addressed to Sherlock Holmes!The letter is from Mycroft [Sherlock's smarter older brother] who orders him to come to Diogenes Club at once, and Sherlock complies.At the meeting, Mycroft (Christopher Lee) orders Sherlock to drop the case, as he knows all about Valladon. Mycroft's insistence doesn't deter Holmes, as the Diogenes Club might be a front for a covert government operation. While they are arguing, Wiggins (Graham Armitage), the messenger at the Diogenes Club enters with an urgent message that requires a reply, and Sherlock hears it -- that the three boxes should be delivered to one location and the runner to another.Back in Baker Street, Holmes decides to disregard Mycroft's orders [after all, he is enjoying Gabrielle's company]. The three take the overnight train to Scotland, where the locations mentioned by Mycroft are, disguised as Mr. and Mrs. Ashdown and their valet. In the night in the bedroom compartment they share, Gabrielle and Holmes trade confidences. Gabrielle asks whether he was ever in love, and Holmes says that he was all set to be married once, his fiancée died of influenza. The way things turned out he considers women to be unreliable and not to be trusted, which is not the same as not liking them. Meantime, in the second class carriage, Watson sits next to a group of monks who do not talk, apparently Trappists. The leader, whom we recognize as the mysterious watcher in Baker Street, is reading a Bible open to the Book of Jonah.They check into a hotel at the shore of Loch Ness. The first location mentioned by Mycroft turns out to be a cemetery. The gravedigger (Sterling Holloway) mentions that one father and two children recently drowned in Loch Ness. He blames the monster.In the next sequences, the clues pile up. Three coffins, one large, two small, arrive, and are buried. Soon four children show up to put flowers on the graves, but as we see their faces, they are not children, but midgets. When Holmes and Watson later dig up the large coffin and open it, Gabrielle shrieks, as we see a youngish man there and two dead canaries that have turned white. The dead man has a copper wedding ring that has turned green, matching Gabrielle's. Watson thinks he saw the Monster on the misty lake. Two suspicious porters deliver large demijohns labeled ""Sulfuric Acid "" to Urquhart Castle. Watson sees the squad of mysterious monks walking around. The trio gets on a rowboat to try to chase the Monster, which is also seen through the mist by Holmes and Gabrielle. Holmes borrows Watson's stethoscope, which is always hidden inside his hat, and listens to the sound of a motor running under water. They gain on it but their boat is pushed from below so they all fall into the loch. At the hotel that evening, Holmes receives a magnum of champagne and the coachman insists he must get into the carriage with him. He is driven to Urquhart Castle and told to go up some exterior stairs that have been covered with a red velvet runner leading up to some tents.At the top of the stairs, Sherlock is met by his brother Mycroft, who first scolds him and then reveals the mystery. A submarine was being developed for the British Navy, with Mr. Valladon on the team. The project was called Jonah because the submarine was to be underwater for three days and three nights. Midgets were recruited as crewmen because they took up less space and needed less air. Sulfuric acid of the batteries accidentally got mixed with sea water, and the mixture released chlorine gas, which killed Valladon, two midgets and two canaries. It turned the canaries white and the copper ring green.However, Gabrielle is not Mrs. Valladon but rather a top German spy named Ilse Hoffmanstal, sent to England with a crew of German sailors, disguised as monks, whose mission is to learn the whereabouts of the submarine and try to steal it. She sent them messages in Morse Code by opening and shutting her pink parasol. They have tricked Sherlock into locating the submarine project, and he fell for it because he became enamored of Gabrielle and could not think properly. When taken out for testing, the submarine was disguised as a sea monster.Queen Victoria (Mollie Maureen) arrives for the christening of the craft with the champagne, but is ""not amused"" when she learns the details because it would kill people without warning from a concealed location, something unworthy of England, and she orders the project scrapped forthwith. Despite Mycroft's pleas that the Germans are developing their own terrible weapons, Zeppelins that could bomb London from the air, she repeats her orders and departs.Before arresting Ilse, it is arranged that the submarine be left unguarded. The squad of monks steals the submarine and sails it off underwater, but it has been rigged to explode.Meantime, Sherlock has returned to the hotel room, where Gabrielle is most fetchingly nude in bed, and we see her from the back as the Rokeby Venus. He is dejected, not only because he has been tricked and another woman and Mycroft have got the better of him, but because he had developed real affection for Gabrielle.Ilse von Hoffmanstal is arrested, but will not go to prison, as she will be exchanged for a British spy at the German-Swiss border. As she is driven off the hotel, she Morse Codes Sherlock back with her parasol, ""Auf Wiedersehen"".Some months later, Sherlock receives a letter from Mycroft, telling him that Ilse was arrested as a spy in Japan, tried and shot. She had been using the alias Mrs. Ashdown.Saddened, the detective retreats to his room to seek solace in cocaine and his violin."

They are resentful of Rosy Ryan (Sarah Miles), the spoilt daughter of the local publican Tom Ryan (Leo McKern), who himself is an informer for the British army hoping to keep the peace in the village. In public, Ryan pretends to be a staunch nationalist; in an early scene, he strongly supports the recently suppressed Easter Rising, referring to the rebels as ""our boys"".Rosy is bored with her humdrum village life and fantasizes about the outside world much to the chagrin of the local priest, Father Hugh Collins (Trevor Howard), an old, sharp-witted and highly influential person who knows all that goes on in the village. Rosy is in love with the local schoolmaster, Charles Shaughnessy (Robert Mitchum), a widower older than herself. She imagines that Shaughnessy will be able to add excitement to her life because he is educated and listens to classical music. He tries to convince her they are not a good match and suggests she leave the village and see the world. The two ultimately marry, but Rosy quickly becomes discontented with her marriage.

However, Michael has also seen the two lovers, and while parading in an improvised British officer's uniform, he tips off the townspeople about the affair. The townspeople turn on Rosy, deriding her as a ""British officer's whore"".One night, in the midst of a fierce storm, IRB leader Tim O'Leary (Barry Foster) who had killed a police constable earlier and a small band of comrades arrive in Ryan's pub and strong-arm Ryan into helping them recover a shipment of German arms from the beach.

Scrooge asks him to sit down, and the ghost does so, although missing the chair. Scrooge tells the ghost he does not believe in him, whereupon the ghost rises in the air, moaning and banging his chains. Scrooge, terrified, admits belief. The ghost explains he wears the chains he forged in life, and that Scrooge has forged one equally as long. The ghost takes him out into the sky, where dozens of phantoms float, and warns him that he may share their fate. The ghost explains that the visit of three ghosts may allow Scrooge to avoid this.When the clock strikes one, the first ghost appears. She takes Scrooge back to his boyhood school, where most of the children are off for a Christmas party. Young Scrooge, however, is left behind. At another Christmas, however, Scrooge's sister Fran comes to take him home, and at a third Scrooge's old master Fezziwig prepares a party with the help of the apprentices. Scrooge doesn't join the dancing, however, as he doesn't know how. But Old Scrooge points out that the money Fezziwig had spent was minimal compared to the happiness that he had brought. He had planned to wed Fezziwig's daughter, and a series of flashbacks occur showing them enjoying time together. The ghost asks why he let her go if he loved her, and they view a final Christmas where she leaves him.Back in his bedroom, Scrooge is ready to pass the whole thing off as a dream, when he hears laughter from the next room. A tall, bearded figure is there with light and a large feast. He offers Scrooge a drink of ""The Milk of Human Kindness"", which he enjoys greatly. The ghost shows Scrooge how to enjoy life, and takes him on a journey to see Bob Cratchett's house. Cratchett proposes a toast to Scrooge, which his wife at first refuses to make, thinking him stingy, but eventually she relents due to the day.When Scrooge asks if Tiny Tim will die, the ghost repeats his words back to him: ""Best that he do it and decrease the surplus population"". They then go to Scrooge's nephew Fred's house, where he is hosting a party. Fred proposes a toast to Scrooge, and says he doesn't think Scrooge is all bad. Scrooge watches the dances and games and wants to get involved, although the ghost gets quite sleepy. Afterwards, Scrooge, nostalgic, wanders back to his house.He wakes in his cold, dark, rooms, and is confronted by the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come. They find a crowd of people outside Scrooge's countinghouse, where everyone is very excited and joyful, much to Scrooge's delight. Happily, he gets up to give a speech, not realizing that his own coffin is being taken out of his house behind him. The coffin is taken down the street with a debtor dancing on it, Scrooge never realizing the true cause of the crowd's joy. Before he finds out, the ghost transports him to Bob Cratchett's house, where the family is working on a grave blanket for Tiny Tim. Scrooge asks to be taken to Tim and the ghost obliges by transporting him to a graveyard where Bob lays a flower on Tim's grave.The ghost points Scrooge to his own grave. He falls in, and down a tunnel into a Netherworld. Marley meets him there to show him to his quarters. Marley confirms that Scrooge is dead, and leads him to an icy cold office, with rats. Several devils bring Scrooge's enormous new chain to him, and wrap it around him. As Scrooge shouts for help, Marley leaves, and once again Scrooge awakens in his bedroom.Thrilled to find himself alive, Scrooge rushes out into the street in his nightshirt, and tells a passing boy to order a huge turkey from the butcher. He then proceeds to the toy store where he purchases almost everything in the store. He takes several presents to his nephew, before dressing as Father Christmas and giving out many toys to the street urchins. Next he goes to Bob Cratchett's to distribute presents, including a large mechanical carousel for Tiny Tim. He then tears up his entire debt ledger and gives 100 guineas to the charity workers. In the end he fastens a beard and Santa hat to the door knocker, telling it that he has to go have Christmas dinner with his family."

Emotions, coitus, and the concept of family are taboo. Everyone is clad in identical uniforms and has shaven heads to emphasize equality, except the police androids (who wear black) and robed monks. Instead of names, people have designations with three arbitrary letters (referred to as the ""prefix"") and four digits, shown on an identity badge worn at all times.At their jobs in central video control centers, SEN 5241 and LUH 3417 keep surveillance on the city. LUH has a male roommate, THX 1138, who works in a factory producing android police officers. At the beginning of the story, THX leaves the job while the loudspeakers urge the workers to ""increase safety"" - and congratulate them for only losing 195 workers in the last period - to the competing factory's 242. On the way home, he stops at a confession booth in a row of many, and mumbles prayers about ""party"" and ""masses"", under the portrait of ""OMM 0000"". A soothing voice greets THX, and OMM ends every confession with a parting salutation: ""You are a true believer, blessings of the State, blessings of the masses. Work hard, increase production, prevent accidents and be happy"".At home, THX takes his drugs and watches holobroadcasts while engaging with a masturbatory device. LUH secretly substitutes pills in her possession for THX's medications, whereupon THX eventually suffers physical discomfort (vomiting) along with mental/emotional changes (confusion). The drug substitution also leads to LUH and THX becoming involved romantically, resulting in the two engaging in intercourse. THX later is confronted by SEN, who arranges THX as his new roommate, but THX files a complaint against SEN for the illegal housing mate change. Without drugs in his system, THX falters during a critical and hazardous phase of his job, and a control center engages a ""mind lock"" on THX which raises the level of danger. After the release of the mind lock, THX makes the necessary correction to that work phase. THX and LUH are arrested. THX enjoys a brief reunion with LUH, disrupted shortly after she reveals her pregnancy.At THX's trial, THX is sentenced to prison, alongside SEN. Most of the prisoners seem uninterested in escape, but eventually THX and SEN find an exit and they are later joined by hologram SRT 5752, who starred in the holobroadcasts. During the escape, THX and SRT are separated from SEN. Chased by the police robots, THX and SRT are trapped in a control center, from which THX learns that LUH has been ""consumed"", and her name has been reassigned to fetus 66691 in a growth chamber. SEN eventually escapes to an area reserved for the monks of OMM, where a lone monk notices that SEN has no identification badge. SEN attacks him and later wanders into a child-rearing area, strikes up a conversation with children, and sits aimlessly until police androids apprehend him. THX and SRT steal two cars, but SRT crashes his into a concrete pillar.Pursued by two police androids on motorcycles, THX flees to the limits of the city and escapes into a ventilation shaft. The police androids pursue him on motorcycles along the ventilation shaft to an escape ladder, but are ordered by Central Command to cease pursuit, on grounds that the expense of his capture exceeds their budget by 6%.

tt0066473,"['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'War']","Tokyo, 1941. As World War II rages in Europe, a change-of-command ceremony takes place aboard the Japanese battleship Nagato, the flagship for the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Soh Yamamura). He takes command from the departing Fleet Admiral Zengo Yoshida (Junya Usami). In Yoshida's cabin, the two of them discuss America's current trade embargo that starves Japan of raw materials including oil due to the war Japan has been waging in China since 1937.While both agree that a war with the United States would be a tragedy for Japan, a meeting between Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoye, Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka, and the hot-headed War Minister General Hideki Tojo (Asao Uchida) reaches a consensus that the time is now ripe to attack the US; Matsuoka believes the U.S. to be pre-occupied with the war in Europe and when Konoye warns that the US has an army in the Philippines and has moved its Pacific Fleet to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, Matsuoka argues that it is all the more reason to prepare for war.The fear of war in Admiral Yamamoto increases when Militarist Japan signs the Tripartite Pact with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in Berlin, making Japan the third member of the Axis Powers - Saburo Kurusu, at the time Japan's ambassador to Germany, is the direct signatory of the pact. Yamamoto orders the planning of a preemptive strike, believing Japan's only hope is to annihilate the American Pacific fleet at the outset of hostilities. Even then, Yamamoto warns that even if that was achieved at the start, he warns Japan would have the advantage for perhaps six months (A prediction that would prove ominously true when the Japanese Navy suffered a crippling defeat at Midway, almost six months to the day after the Pearl Harbor attack).When planning the attack, the Japanese commanders debate Pearl Harbor's exposure to a torpedo attack, but realize that torpedoes dropped from an aircraft will fall and submerge at least 75 feet (23 meters) below the surface. Since Pearl Harbor is only 40 feet (12 meters) deep, the Americans feel they have a natural defense against torpedoes. This belief is reflected in conversation while overflying the harbor between Admiral Husband Kimmel, the new Commander of the Pacific Fleet, and his predecessor Admiral James Richardson, bitter because he'd opposed moving the Fleet from San Diego.But the Japanese devise a plan to overcome this obstacle; they fit small wooden stabilizers to aerial torpedoes, making them effective in the shallow harbor; they also retrofit armor-piercing battleship shells, converting them to aerial bombs effective against the American ships.In a major intelligence victory, American intelligence in Washington, through the Navy Department, manages to break the Japanese Purple Code, allowing the United States to intercept radio transmissions the Japanese think are secret. American intelligence in Washington, in the persons of Navy Lt. Commander Alvin Kramer and Army G-2 Lt. Colonel Rufus Bratton (E.G. Marshall), is seen collecting increasingly threatening radio intercepts and conveying their concern to a White House staff that seems strangely unresponsive. The American response to high quality intelligence in general appears lax, although Pearl Harbor does increase air patrols and goes on full alert well before the raid.Japanese commanders call on the famous Air Staff Officer Genda Minoru (Tatsuya Mihashi) to mastermind the attack.At Pearl Harbor, although hampered by a late-arriving critical intelligence report about the attack fleet, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel (Martin Balsam) and General Walter C. Short (Jason Robards) do their best to enhance defenses. Short orders his aircraft to be concentrated in the middle of their airfields to prevent sabotage (leading to a pointed bit of dialogue between two officers when one objects to the order by saying, ""Suppose there's an air raid?"") To his credit, General Short also arranges more radar stations, a very new air defense technology for that time for that old soldier, and overcomes conflicting administrations like the Parks department to make that possible.In Japan, Yamamoto tries to avoid an attack and blames the Japanese Army for pushing too hard for war when peace is still an option. Yamamoto stresses that the United States is a mighty foe who would be extremely dangerous to provoke. In order to defeat the United States, he claims, destroying the U.S. fleet or even capturing Hawaii would not suffice Japan would have to invade the mainland and dictate terms of U.S. surrender on the White House steps, an eventuality Yamamoto clearly sees as impossible to achieve.In Washington D.C., diplomatic tensions increase between the U.S. and Japan as the Japanese ambassador to the United States is seen asking Tokyo for more information to aid in negotiations to avoid war, but getting little or nothing to work with in return. Tojo adamantly opposes any last minute attempts at peace, and by December 6 Japan commences a series of 14 radio messages from Tokyo to the Japanese embassy in Washington that will conclude with the declaration of war. But the Americans are translating the radio messages faster than the Japanese embassy, whose own reception and processing of their own government's message is frustratingly slow. Hence, the Americans know some kind of attack is coming before the Japanese ambassador informs them.On the morning of Sunday, December 7, 1941 decision makers in Washington and Hawaii are seen enjoying a leisurely routine while American intelligence works feverishly to interpret the coded transmissions and learns the final message will be received precisely at 1:00 pm Washington time. Colonel Bratton notes that the final message instructs the Japanese Ambassador to destroy their code machines after they decode the last of the 14 messages as well as destroy all written documents at the embassy in preparation for imminent internment... an ominous point. Bratton's frantic attempts to convey this message to American commanders fail because they are enjoying a Sunday of playing golf and horseback riding.Bratton manages to contact Commander Kramer (Wesley Addy), about the last part of the 14th message. Kramer then relays it to Chief of Naval Operations Harold Rainsford Stark (Edward Andrews) who is informed of the increased threat, but decides not to inform Hawaii until after calling the President first... although it is not clear if he takes any action at all.Finally, at 11:30 a.m. Washington time, Bratton convinces the Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall (Keith Andes), that a greater threat exists, and Marshall orders that Pearl Harbor (and all other Pacific installations) be notified of an impending attack.Meanwhile in Hawaii, an American destroyer, USS Ward, spots a Japanese two-man midget submarine trying to slip through the defensive net and enter Pearl Harbor. The destroyer attacks and sinks the submarine, and notifies the base. Although the receiving officer, Lieutenant Kaminsky (Neville Brand), takes the report of an attempted enemy incursion seriously, the pompous Captain John Earle (Richard Anderson) at Pearl Harbor demands confirmation before calling an alert. Admiral Kimmel later learns of this negligence and is furious he was not told of this enemy action immediately. Rather then call a high alert, he decides to call for an emergency meeting of his officers at headquarters at 8:00 am.Just after 7:00 am, two U.S. Army privates posted at the remote radar station, Joseph Lockard and George Elliot, spot the incoming Japanese aircraft and inform the Hickam Field Information Center, but the Army Air Forces Lieutenant in charge, Kermit Tyler, dismisses the report, thinking it is a group of American B-17 bombers coming from the mainland, and he is frankly too tired to care after a night of drinking.The Japanese intend to break off negotiations (they do not intend to issue a formal declaration of war) at 1:00 p.m. Washington time, 30 minutes before the attack. However, the typist for the Japanese ambassador is slow, and cannot decode the 14th part fast enough. So Ambassador Kichisaburo Nomura (Shôgo Shimada) decides to postpone his meeting with the Secretary of State.A final attempt to warn Pearl Harbor is stymied by poor atmospherics and bungling when the telegram sent by General Marshall is not marked urgent; it will be received by Pearl Harbor during the attack. The incoming Japanese fighter pilots are pleasantly surprised when there isn't even any anti-aircraft fire as they approach the base. As a result, the squadron attack leader Commander Mitsuo Fuchida (Takahiro Tamura) radios in the code phrase marking that complete surprise for the attack has been achieved: ""Tora, Tora, Tora.""Once the Japanese attack planes commence fire, the soldiers and sailors at Pearl and nearby bases respond and return fire, but with surprise achieved resistance against the Japanese planes is desperate and only partially effective. Upon seeing the Japanese low-level bombers, an American officer instructs his colleague to get the tail numbers so the pilot can be reported for safety violations; he thinks they are American aircraft. The sight of the offending aircraft then deliberately dropping a bomb on the base dispels that misconception. At that shock, he and his companion sprint to a telegraph officer to send what would be a famous telegram to raise the alarm; ""AIR RAID ON PEARL HARBOR THIS IS NO DRILL.""The aircraft security precautions by General Short prove a disastrous mistake that allows the Japanese aerial forces to destroy the U.S. aircraft on the ground with ease, thereby crippling an effective aerial counter-attack: all the aircraft on the runways at the major airfields are destroyed spectacularly either as they took off or while they were still parked.Amid the mayhem the force of B-17 bombers Lt. Tyler mistakenly believed was the earlier radar contact, a force commanded by Major Truman Landon, arrives at Oahu per schedule and is immediately attacked by both Japanese fighters and gunners from US ships mistaking them for enemy craft, forcing the bombers to scatter and try to make emergency landings. As if this crisis wasn't enough for Major Landon's unarmed and low-on-fuel bomber squadron, the Major's own plane's landing gear cannot deploy completely and he has to crash land at an airbase, although apparently with no injuries.Even in this debacle for the US Navy, there are still acts of American heroism such as Doris Miller, an African-American seaman who goes above and beyond the call of duty (especially considering he was not allowed to be trained in an on-board combat role due to the US Navy's racist policies) to take command of an unattended machine gun to help defend the base. There were also two American fighter pilots, Ken Taylor and George Welch, who race to remote Haleiwa and manage to take off to engage the enemy, as the Japanese have not hit the smaller airfields. Taylor and Welch engage several Japanese planes over Oahu and manage to shoot down several Japanese fighters and bombers while escaping scot free.The catastrophic damage wrought by the attacking Japanese air fleet is well detailed, with sailors fighting as long as they can and then abandoning sinking ships and jumping into the water with burning oil on the surface - the sight of the wreckage also enables Lieutenant Kaminsky to deliver comeuppance to the horrified Captain Earle when he arrives at the base and sees for himself the havoc wrought by the Japanese. Admiral Kimmel fares little better considering that when he is helplessly watching his base being ravaged, a spent bullet penetrates a window and hits him with little physical harm, but the shame of this debacle under his command and the knowledge that he will likely be unfairly blamed for it leaves him commenting that it have been merciful if it killed had him.The pivotal point of the attack comes amid a plethora of torpedo hits delivered to several US battleships - a Japanese bomber, sporting one of the converted armor-piercing shells, closes on its target - identified via a newspaper photo taped to the cockpit's side - the USS Arizona. The bomb lands on the ship's armored deck near one of the main turrets, smashes through, detonates forward magazines, and the malestrom of explosions erupts into one catastrophic blast whose shockwave rocks even the bomber. In addition to that loss, the sinking of the battleship sinks on the underwater pipes below that supply water for firefighters, impeding their effort to prevent fires from reaching the base's massive oil storage facilities and potentially causing catastrophic new fires and explosions that could destroy much of the entire base.At the end of the attacks, Fuchida and all surviving Japanese planes return to their carriers to insist a third wave be launched against Pearl Harbor in a late afternoon or evening strike. But the Japanese fleet commander, Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (Eijiro Tono), refuses to launch the third wave of carrier aircraft out of fear of exposing his six carriers to increased risk of detection and destruction from the still-absent US carriers.(Through the years, this action has been debated as having given the Americans a major break in their efforts to recover from the attack. A third wave would have likely struck the large oil tanks as well as destroyed the dry docks and repair facilities, potentially serious blows which could have crippled the U.S. Pacific Fleet for months by themselves.)Despite strong protests by Fuchida as well as most of the naval officers on board the carrier flagship Akagi (including Genda) to mount another attack against Pearl Harbor, Nagumo overrules all of them and orders the Japanese fleet to sail for home.With the U.S. base in flames, its frustrated commanders, General Short and Admiral Kimmel, finally get the War Department's telegram warning them of impending danger. In Washington, the US Secretary Of State, Cordell Hull (George Macready), is stunned at learning of this brazen attack and urgently requests confirmation of it before receiving the Japanese ambassador who is waiting just outside his office. The distraught Japanese ambassador Nomura, helpless and at a loss of words to explain the late ultimatum and the unprovoked sneak attack, is bluntly rebuffed by Hull, who coldly replies to the final Japanese communique: ""In all my fifty years of public service, I have never seen a document crowded with falsehoods and deliberate distortions on a scale so huge that, until this day, I would have thought no nation on Earth capable of uttering them!"" Ambassador Nomura leaves Hull's office to return to the embassy where he and his staff will presumably be detained by the authorities.At Pearl Harbor, the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, arrives several hours after the attack where Admiral Halsey (James Whitmore) observes the devastation of the harbor and orders his officers to have the ship refitted and to set out at nightfall.In the final scene, back in Japan, Admiral Yamamoto is seen lamenting the fact that the Americans did not receive the declaration of war until 50 minutes after the attack started, noting that nothing would infuriate the Americans more. He is quoted as saying: ""I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.""The closing credits roll over the American fleet at Pearl Harbor in flames."

She reveals before dying that a fortune in jewels had been hidden from the Bolsheviks by being sewn into the seat cushion of one of the twelve chairs from the family's dining room set. After hearing the dying woman's Confession, the corrupt Russian Orthodox priest Father Fyodor (Dom DeLuise), who had arrived to administer the Last Rites, decides to abandon the Church and attempt to steal the treasure for himself. Shortly afterwards in the town of Stargorod, where Vorobyaninov's former mansion is located, a homeless con-artist, Ostap Bender (Frank Langella), meets the dispossessed nobleman and manipulates his way into a partnership in his search for the family riches.Vorobyaninov goes to his former mansion where his old manservent Tikon (Mel Brooks) still resides along with several impoverished families crowding into the large estate to inquire about the 12 chairs. Tikon tells his former master that the chairs, along with all other private property, had been appropriated by the State after the Russian Revolution 10 years earlier. Vorobyaninov and Bender set off together to locate the chairs and recover the fortune, but are stymied by a series of false leads and other trying events. They find that the chairs have been split up and sold individually. Therefore, their hunt requires a great deal of travel to track down and open up each piece of the set in order to eliminate it as a possible location of the booty. As they progress, they meet comrades from every walk of life in Soviet Russian society, transforming the film into a satirical send up of failing Communism.By posing as the official in charge of the Department of Chairs, Bender tricks Father Fyodor into a wild goose chase to recover a similar set of eleven chairs in the possession of an engineer in a remote province in Siberia. Father Fyodor makes the long journey only to be thrown out of the engineer's house. When the engineer is reassigned to a post on the Black Sea, Fyodor follows him and buys the counterfeit chairs (on the condition that the engineer and his wife never see him again). He finds that none of the chairs has the jewels. Later, he runs across Vorobyaninov and Bender after they have retrieved one chair from a circus, and while being chased by them frantically climbs with the chair straight up the side of a mountain. After finding out that this chair doesn't contain the jewels, he finds that he is unable to get down again without help. Vorobyaninov and Bender leave him to his fate.After traveling many miles and perpetrating numerous cons to pay for the lengthy enterprise, the two men return to Moscow where they discover the last chair; because the others contained no hidden treasure, this one must contain it all. It is located in a Palace of Culture, which is inconvenient due to the presence of so many witnesses. Vorobyaninov and Bender return after closing time, entering through a window Bender secretly had unlocked earlier.At the moment of discovery, Bender carefully and quietly opens the chair cushion with his knife, but their hopes are dashed as it is found to be completely empty. Vorobyaninov is stunned and angry, but Bender laughs at the absurdity of the situation. A watchman finds them, and Vorobyaninov demands to know what happened to the jewels. ""Look around you,"" the watchman answers, explaining that after the jewels were accidentally found, they were used to finance construction of the grand building in which they stand. Driven into a sudden rage, Vorobyaninov smashes the chair to pieces and assaults the officer whom the watchman has summoned. After admonishing him for hitting a policeman, Bender leads the way and they escape into the night.At the end of his patience, demoralized and bankrupted, Bender proposes that he and Vorobyaninov go their separate ways. In a desperate attempt to keep Bender from leaving, Vorobyaninov flings the remains of the last chair into the air, and collapses to the ground feigning an epileptic seizure; this is an act they had previously rehearsed as part of a con. Bender calls for the crowd's attention and begs the passers-by to give generously to this sad and stricken man.

Upon hearing the surrender of his last army under Auguste Marmont he realises that finally all is lost and accepts the abdication pleas of his marshallate. He is banished to Elba, an island in the Mediterranean with a small army of 1,000. Ney (O'Herlihy) calls it an honourable exile.After a tearful farewell to the Old Guard, he is carted away. 10 months later he escapes from Elba and sails back to France. Michel Ney, now under the allegiance of the restored Bourbon king (Welles) is asked to capture him at Grenoble. Ney agrees, eager to earn the respect of the court, who just the day before insulted his ""low birth"" wife by addressing her as ""Madame"" despite her title. He declares he'll bring Napoleon back to Paris ""in an iron cage"", which Louis XVIII says to himself is an exaggerated expression and an overreaction, typical for a militarist.The two men meet on the road from Grenoble. Napoleon, sensing the mood of Ney's troops, goes forward unarmed and asks them if they really want to fire at him.Instead they greet him with cries of ""Vive l'Empereur!"". Ney is instantly swayed and marches with him and his former soldiers. They return to Paris to a warm welcome by the people. King Louis has fled and the Hundred Days has begun.Napoleon appoints Louis' former Minister of War, Marshal Soult Chief of Staff and he corresponds to the families of the deceased during the war and plans a campaign for the defence of France. He realises he will be attacked but genuinely offers peace to his enemies, who, once more, ignore his communiques and declare war.Prussia and the United Kingdom's forces manoeuvre to counter Napoleon's expected thrust. The armies are not well coordinated and separate, much to the joy of Napoleon, who prepares to place his army between them and defeat one followed by the other.Attention is now drawn to Wellington (Plummer), who attends the Duchess of Richmond's ball, where Picton and other generals are present. One of his soldiers is engaged to her daughter, and the Duchess begs they keep him away from the battlefield so her daughter won't ""wear black before she wears white"". The young officer declares he will bring back a cuirassier's helmet. Picton overhears and points out that if he ever meets a cuirassier, he'll be lucky to escape with his life, never mind a helmet.The ball is interrupted by General Müffling (John Savident), who announces that Napoleon has crossed the Belgian border at Charleroi, much to Wellington's displeasure. He realises that Napoleon has got between himself and Blücher's Prussians and is on the road to Brussels. Hastily looking at his map, he decides that they will meet at Waterloo.The soldiers are now on their way to Waterloo. Attention then turns to Marschall Blücher (Sergo Zaqariadze) who is seventy-two years of age and yet commands the Prussian army and re-buffs advice by General Gneisenau to retreat. Wellington has done so, but Ney returns to Napoleon to deliver his report on the engagement, which angers Napoleon, who had expected Ney to pursue Wellington, who is now free to choose his own battlefield. Wellington arrives at Waterloo, and asks Blücher to join him in the battle but Müffling wants a new horse to reach him. Wellington is not amused. Before this, an Irish soldier plunders a pig for food. Looting is a capital offence in the British Army, but when Wellington catches him the looter claims the pig got lost and he was trying to find her relatives. Instead of punishing him, Wellington orders the soldier to be promoted to corporal, for he ""knows how to defend a helpless position"". Wellington then tells de Lancey:I do not know what they'll do to the enemy, but by God, they frighten me!Napoleon is in pain because of trouble with his stomach but when he is asked whether he wants the doctor, he refuses and following a few minutes, he orders his generals out of his outpost after going through tactics. A storm is raging outside with heavy rain pouring down.The day of the battle dawns bright and dry and Napoleon invites his generals to breakfast. They hear the ringing of the local church bell and are initially surprised, until de la Bedoyère mentions that the pastor intends to go ahead with the sermon, despite the looming battle.Napoleon is in a happy mood compared to the night before but now the commander of artillery brings bad news. The rains of the previous night have made it impossible to manoeuvre the French guns. The battle must be delayed until the ground dries. Napoleon, who agrees with Ney that they had fought with muddy boots previously, alone among his generals realises that each delay brings the Prussians closer. He is annoyed and leaves his breakfast to look at the battlefield.The armies move into position opposite each other. Both commanders take turns to ride amongst their troops. Ponsonby and Wellington both marvel at the precision of the French formations, while Wellington refuses permission to an artillery officer to fire long range shot at Napoleon himself. ""Leaders of armies have better things to do than fire at each other!""The battle starts shortly after 11.30am with cannon fire from the French. Napoleon then sends a diversionary infantry attack against Wellington's right flank, the Chateau of Hougoumont with the view to stretch the Allied line and to ""see the quality of this English aristocrat [Wellington]"". Wellington ignores this attack and keeps his line firm.Napoleon sends the corps of d'Erlon up the ridge where Wellington's men are sheltering from the French guns. As they crest the rise they are locked in fierce fighting but are repulsed by British cavalry. Picton's troops plug a gap in the line, but a French musket ball strikes him in the head through his hat, killing him. Meanwhile, Ponsonby's cavalry brigade, including the renowned Scots Greys, have chased the French all the way back to their lines but have become disorganised and their horses blown. Wellington sounds the recall signal, but it is either not heard or is ignored. Napoleon sends his Polish lancers to attack them and Ponsonby is killed after his horse gets stuck in mud.As the battle proceeds, Wellington reorganises his lines, moving them a few yards further back, so they are out of the reach of the French artillery. While Napoleon has taken a short leave from the field, again stricken with stomach pain, Ney sees the movement and believes the British are retreating, and orders the French cavalry to advance on them. The allied units form infantry squares to repel the massed cavalry attacks. A soldier by the name of Tomlinson (Oleg Vidov) wanders from his square and shouts out, ""we've never seen each other! How can we kill one another?"". He is later seen dead. Richard Hay rallies the faltering squares, urging his men to ""think of England"" before he is struck by a musket ball and killed, much to the upset of Wellington, a good friend.Napoleon returns and angrily rebukes his marshals for allowing Ney to attack without infantry support. The attacks are repulsed and the French have no fresh troops left, yet Napoleon can see that the cavalry attacks have weakened the Allied line. He determines that the farmhouse of La Haye Sainte is the key to the battlefield and orders its capture. After fierce fighting, a French flag flies above it and Napoleon asks Soult to write a letter to Paris that the battle and the war have been won.Napoleon now sends forward the Imperial Guard to smash the failing allied line. He begins leading the men from the front of the formation himself, but his marshals insist he fall back. Wellington is desperate. He asks for ""night... or Blücher!"". Wellington orders the forces on his left flank - ""every brigade, every battalion"" - to abandon their position, to reinforce his center and ""put every gun to them"".At the same time, the French spot Blücher's Prussian army as they emerge onto the battlefield from the woods, with Blücher warning his men that he will shoot any man he sees with pity for the French. A frustrated Napoleon remarks, ""I made one mistake in my life, I should have burnt Berlin"".As the French continue their advance over the hill, they realize too late that Maitland's Guards Division is on the reverse of the slope, lying down unseen in the grass, waiting for the French. Wellington calls out to him: ""Now, Maitland! Now is your time!"". The Guards stand up and at point-blank range fire volley after volley at the French column. The Imperial Guard withdraws, defeated, amid great consternation. Napoleon and Ney attempt to rally the broken army, but to no avail. French morale collapses and a general retreat begins, as Wellington gives the signal for a general advance.The Imperial Guard forms squares in an attempt to ward off the advancing allied forces. Meanwhile, the French retreat has quickly deteriorated into a rout, and Napoleon's marshals physically force the Emperor himself to withdraw from the battlefield.To save their lives, under a flag of truce, a British officer offers surrender terms to Pierre Cambronne (Yevgeny Samoilov), who replies with the famous ""mot de Cambronne"". In a rare departure from real-life events, the British cavalry move aside to reveal a line of artillery, and proceed to blast the obstinate French square, killing most in it. In reality, as the battle had been won, Blücher and Wellington met to signal the defeat of Napoleon, which is not seen in the film.Wellington is not cheered by his victory. As he surveys the desolate battlefield, which has already attracted looters, he laments, in voice over, that ""next to a battle lost, the saddest thing is a battle won"".Meanwhile, Napoleon, surrounded by Ney, de la Bedoyère and his marshals, is seen leaving the battlefield in his coach, knowing that this time his days as Emperor really have ended."

Jeff Gerber (Godfrey Cambridge) lives in an average suburban neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley with his seemingly liberal housewife Althea (Estelle Parsons), who tolerates her husband's character flaws out of love, and two children, 10-year-old Burton (Scott Garrett) and eight-year-old Janice (Erin Moran). Every morning when Jeff wakes up, he spends some time under a sun lamp, bats around a boxing ball, drinks a health drink, and races the bus to work on foot.Jeff works as an insurance agent in downtown L.A. where he presents himself to his co-workers and other people as happy-go-lucky and quite a joker, but others tend to see him as obnoxious and boorish. Althea, who watches the 1968 race riots every night on TV with great interest, chastises Jeff for not having sympathy for the problems of black Americans.One morning, Jeff wakes up to find that his pigment has inexplicably changed; he is a black person. He tries to fall back asleep, thinking that it is a dream, but to no avail. He tries taking a shower to wash the ""black"" off him, but finds it doesn't work, when Althea walks into the bathroom, and screams. He explains to her that the ""Negro in the bathroom"" is him.At first, Jeff believes this to be the result of spending too much time under the sun lamp. He spends almost the entire day at home, afraid to go out of the house, only going out once to venture into the ""colored part of town"" in order to find a pharmacy to buy ""the stuff they use in order to make themselves look white."" His attempts to change his skin color fail from using skin creme, to industrialized soap, to even a ""milk bath"".The next day, he is persuaded to get up and go to work. As he normally does, he races down the street with joy to catch his bus but when he, a ""black man"", is spotted he is harassed by several racist white people who call the police thinking that Jeff is running because he has just committed a crime. When the police question him all of the white people surround him as the police check his briefcase. When they find a pair of shoes inside they accuse him of stealing them and he tries to explain that they are his work shoes he changes into when he arrives at work. The crowd is now loudly shouting and the police make him try the shoes on.... when they fit they are still unsure until the bus driver, whom is black, comes to his defense explaining that he is a regular passenger who was simply running to catch it. With that, the police leave without arresting Jeff who thanks the bus driver for helping him out of this jam. The bus driver tells Jeff that he never realized that he was black before. Some witty banter ensues as they board the bus.He gets off of the bus near his office building and walks into the diner he stops at every morning for his health drink and he is met with the same shock and confusion by the black man who serves him his drink every day. The server also says he never realized he was black before and more witty banter about his color ensues.Upon arrival at work, his co-workers all react with shock at his new ""black"" appearance and are at a loss of words to ask Jeff what has happened to him. His boss wants to see him immediately and he walks into his office and sits down in front of him. His boss doesn't seem to ""get"" that Jeff has turned black but asks him if he is spending too much time under his sun lamp as his tan is very dark. Jeff makes a witty comment back and his boss is so occupied with Jeff's decreased sales that he passes right over the fact that Jeff is now black and continues to question him about how he can bring his sales up and warns him he must. Jeff agrees and walks back into his own office where he sits at his desk and begins to make sales calls.The previous day, Jeff had set up a lunch appointment with a wealthy client at an upscale restaurant. When he arrives at the restaurant he is rudely greeted by the door man who will not let him in due to his race. Jeff explains he has a meeting with his client to no avail. By this time all of the black people witnessing this begin to rally around Jeff and cause a scene. The manager comes outside and again Jeff politely tries to explain he is meeting someone for a business lunch and asks the manager to get the man inside to clear it all up but the manager refuses and the police are called. They bring Jeff back to his office and ask his boss if he is in fact his employee and when his boss confirms that he is, the police leave him there again without making an arrest. His boss is still not fully understanding about Jeff's condition but sees that somehow this can help drum up business.After work, Jeff goes his local physician and makes an appointment who is equally shocked and cannot explain Jeff's ""condition"" either but agrees to look into it.The next day, Jeff is forced to sit at the bus stop instead of running to catch the bus to avoid any more hassles with white people. Jeff is forced to sit in the back of the bus by the current segregation laws to leave the front seats only for white people. At lunch, Jeff is now forced to go across town to eat at a diner which is a ""blacks only"" eating place. After a second visit to his doctor for his ""skin condition"" reveals nothing of the ordinary about his skin, his racist doctor shows his own ""true colors"" when he suggests that Jeff might be more comfortable with a black doctor and refuses to consul with him anymore.Returning home that afternoon, he finds the front door locked (which it usually isn't) as well as the curtains and shades drawn, and Althea afraid to leave the house, look out the windows, or answer the ringing phone. He doesn't understand why until he receives an anonymous phone call from an unseen man who says: ""move out, nigger!"" Jeff is forced to take the phone off the hook for the night since it keeps ringing every few minutes with more anonymous phone calls from racist people telling him to move out. Also, unseen people throw eggs and splatter black paint at his front door and windows.At work the next day, a secretary (who had previously ignored him) makes several advances toward him, finding him more attractive as a black man. Jeff's boss suggests that they could drum up extra business with a ""Negro"" salesman which he persuades Jeff to travel to African-American neighborhoods across the city to pitch more of his sales over the next few days as Jeff becomes more observant to other black people and how they live.After returning home from work one evening, he finds four men in his home who had apparently made the threatening phone calls to his house (despite their unconvincing denials), who offer him $50,000 to move out of the neighborhood despite the fact they have known him for several years. The racist neighbors tell Jeff right to his face that they don't want a ""nigger"" living on the same street at they do. Jeff manages to raise the price to $100,000 by using some veiled threats about moving ""his people"" into the neighborhood. After the men leave, Althea, somewhat angered that Jeff used his new race to blackmail his neighbors into bribing him to move out of the neighborhood, sends their two children away to live with a relative. Burton and Janice tell Jeff they they are both awkward and uncomfortable with their father being black. On top of all that, they are now being bullied at their school by their classmates over their father's new racial affiliation.Although she still loves Jeff, Althea's sanity begins to break from the stress of the whole thing of Jeff now being black and of the neighbors continuing to make harassing phone calls and leaving threatening letters. As a result, she leaves him to rejoin her kids and move far away, thus leaving Jeff alone and without a home to live in.Finally accepting the fact that he is black (and always will be for the rest of his life), Jeff goes to work the next day where he tells off his boss by saying that he quits and vows to open his own insurance business. Jeff moves out of the all-white suburban neighborhood and into a small apartment in a black neighborhood in the downtown part of the city. Jeff then starts his own insurance company which soon becomes successful due to his education and expertise. Jeff also starts a tryst with his former secretary whom continues to be turned on by his new negro appearance. However Jeff still manages to communicate with his wife while he embraces his new race by going out evenings to ""blacks only"" nightclubs, restaurants, bars, and other places.The very last scene shows Jeff practicing martial arts with a group of black menial workers, apparently having become one of the militants he used to put down."

The man declines such actions and pulls a knife on Roberto when the drummer gets too close. In the struggle, the man is accidentally stabbed and he falls from the stage to the lower level. Suddenly a spotlight is turned onto Roberto and a masked person on the balcony snaps some photos of Roberto holding the bloody knife.That night, Roberto returns home and lies in bed awake as his wife Nina (Mimsy Farmer) lies beside him.

After dropping off Arrosio at his apartment, Roberto returns to his house where Nina is leaving town with police officers about the Amelia murder. She tells Roberto that she does not want to stay in the house anymore with someone stalking them. But Roberto decides to stay and invites Dalia over to spend time with him. That evening Roberto takes a bath when Dalia walks in and admits that she has had romantic feelings for him and the two of them make love. Afterwards, Arrosio arrives and is a little surprised to see Roberto with Dalia and that Nina has left. Roberto gives Arrosio some photos of his past and his family as well as Nina's and Dalia's. Then, they find Roberto's pet cat's head and wrapped in plastic. That night, Roberto has his nightmare again about the decapitation execution, and wakes up in a cold sweat. Dalia comforts him.Meanwhile, Arrosio is in his office looking at photos of Roberto's family and friends, as well as some old papers and financial records. He is getting frustrated at not making any progress with the case until something catches his eye. He begins looking through more old papers of Roberto's past. A little later that same night, Arrosio phones Roberto and tells him that he's found a ""strange resemblance"" in one photo, but tells him that it may only be a red herring. Arrosio tells Roberto that he's found the name ""Villa Rapidi"" and asks if anyone ever mentioned it, but Roberto claims to have never heard it before. Arrosio thanks Roberto and hangs up without telling him what it means.The next day, Arrosio arrives at the Villa Rapidi Psychiatric Clinic where a doctor tells the private investigator about a patient that Arrosio is inquiring about (the name is not mentioned) who stayed there for three years as a teenager, whom was diagnosed as a homicidal mania. When the father who committed the teenager died from a sudden heart attack, the mental symptoms disappeared overnight and the patient was deemed cured. The doctor also suspects that the man who committed the teen and the teen's mother there was not the patient's real father.Arrosio talks to various people around Rome looking for the nameless ex-patient from Villa Rapidi. He later visits an estate-turned-boarding-house where he talks to the landlord about the patient he is looking for. The boarding house is the residence of the killer. Arrosio follows the unseen person from the estate and onto a subway train. He gets off at the person's stop and follows the unseen person to the men's room where the unseen killer attacks him in a stall, and stabs him in the chest with a syringe of a glowing blue poison. The killer leaves, as Arrosio lies dying on the restroom floor. But with a smile on his face and with his last breath, Arrosio mumbles, ""I was right..."".Roberto learns of Arrosio's murder and meets with Godfrey and the Professor at a convention hall where coffins are being sold. Roberto tells them about his nightmares and Godfrey thinks that it might be a premonition of something to come. Godfrey suggests that someone with a grudge against Roberto is trying to drive him crazy and wants him to leave Rome at once. But Roberto refuses, determined to find the killer on his own.A few days later, Dalia calls the studio asking for Roberto, but he is busy recording music with his band. As Dalia packs her suitcase, she notices a strange similarly between a recent photo of Roberto and Nina with some unseen person in another photo. Just then, Dalia hears a noise and is frightened. Dalia slips off her shoes and sneaks up to the attic where she arms herself with a knife and waits as she hears the intruder looking for her. Dalia hides behind a door with the knife when the killer comes inside, then leaves. When Dalia thinks the killer is gone, she steps out of the doorway when a knife hits her on her forehead. Dalia stumbles down the attic stairs and is stabbed to death by the unseen killer.After finding the body, Roberto calls the police and they tell him about a test they will do on Dalia. By removing one of her eyes and shooting a laser through it, they will be able to see the last image that Dalia had seen for the image is retained on the retina for several hours after death. On a computer screen, they see only four dark smudges against a gray background which looks like, as the technician puts it, ""four flies on gray velvet."" The test is declared inconclusive.That night, Roberto loads a gun and sits in his dark home, waiting for the killer to make his move. He nods off and begins dreaming again, and his dream goes all the way with the gory beheading of a criminal in Saudi Arabia. Roberto is woken up when the phone rings and it is Godfrey asking if the drummer is okay. Roberto says that he is, and then the line goes dead. A few minutes later, Nina arrives home from her long getaway and Roberto almost shoots her as she walks through the front door. Roberto puts down the gun and tells her to leave and tries to push her out the front door, when Nina's necklace (a fly enclosed in glass) swings.... giving the appearance of more than one fly, and Roberto pulls her back inside and hits her. Roberto confronts Nina and accuses her of killing Amelia, Arrosio, and Dalia, and the one who terrorized him. Nina grabs Roberto's gun and shoots him the in shoulder. As Roberto lies wounded on the floor, Nina suddenly adopts a sneering, wild-eyed appearance. Nina mechanically laughs and she tells Roberto about her abusive stepfather who placed her in a lunatic asylum when she was little and when he died, her mental condition was cured. But when Nina apparently met Roberto many years later, he reminded her of her late father. So, Nina married Roberto and cooked up this whole event as part of her twisted way of getting back at her father, since Roberto is apparently the dead-splitting image of Nina's late father. Nina shoots Roberto a few more times in his arm and both legs, when Godfrey runs in and Roberto knocks the gun out of Nina's hands. Nina runs to Roberto's car and speeds away. But in a twist of fate, she doesn't look where she is going and rams into the back of a truck, and she is decapitated by the truck's rear bumper as it smashes, in slow-motion, through her car windshield. The car then explodes in a mass of flames."

As the man sleeps, the skylight opens, the birdcage is lowered, and the black cover is hoisted up, soon followed by the cage itself, showing a bottom trapdoor swinging open. The skylight is closed.The man awakens, hearing disturbing little sounds about his room. He looks 'round, sees nothing but then hears little squeaks and flutters. Shadows flutter past. Suddenly there are bats on his bed climbing towards his face, screeching. The man is terrified.The car returns to the mansion. The clockwork musicians kick into gear, playing ""What Can I Say After I Say I'm Sorry?,"" with print upon the bass drum: ""Dr. Phibes Clockwork Wizards."" The figure in black enters the mansion while the woman closes up the car. The man in black switches off his musicians and sits at the organ, while the young woman appears on the balcony. As the man plays a contented tune on the organ, he and it sink back into the floor.Next morning, a butler approaches his master's bedroom, wheeling breakfast. He knocks, enters the room, and says ""good morning, sir"" (the first spoken words, ten minutes into the film). A bat lands on the breakfast plate. He looks about to see bats hanging all over the room, and his master dead, face slashed and riddled with blood. Horrified, he runs from the room.At the mansion, the dark figure hangs a pendant over one of the wax busts (matching the man just killed) and burns its face with fire.Back in the dead man's bedroom, Sgt. Tom Schenley, on ladder, removes a last bat from the skylight, while Police Inspector Trout pronounces it a strange business. Schenley recalls a similarly weird death involving another surgeon, stung by bees in his library, his face a mass of boils. Trout chides two officers about to carry the dead doctor out with his shredded face uncovered.At the mansion, two prosthetic ears and a nose sit on a dressing table. The formerly dark figure now dressed in white (face unseen), takes the nose, then the ears, then a light brown wig. The composed face of Dr. Anton Phibes is now seen (a colorful rendition of the black and white face painted on the car window. He sits at his organ with its red plastic panels, adjusts a few tabs, and begins to play. After a few measures, the organ and player begin to rise to the floor above.Party scene. Camera focuses closely on another pendant worn by Phibes, zooming out to see him in a tux and handing an elegant frog's head mask to Dr. Hargreaves, who didn't know the party was a masked affair. Phibes, masked as a bird of prey, speaks nary a word. Psychiatrist Dr. Hargreaves, introduces himself (""head shrinker,"" he chuckles) and asks for Phibes' help donning the mask with its fancy catch in back. Phibes obliges, which sets the mask's ever-tightening catch in motion. Phibes continues to be a dour, silent and watchful presence as Hargreaves joins the party. ""Darktown Strutters' Ball"" plays as the frog mask strangles the screaming doctor, who collapses and falls down a flight of stairs, blood squirting from the mouth of the frog mask.Back at the mansion and dressed in black, Phibes hangs his pendant over the next wax bust and blowtorches the face of Dr. Hargreaves, hot wax dripping on the pendant.At the police station, Chief Inspector Crow dismisses Trout's request for additional men to investigate the growing string of exotic doctor murders. Bat, bee and frog, indeed. The men are together only in not wanting the press involved. Crow declares there are very strange people practicing medicine these days.At the mansion, Phibes, with a cauldron boiling in the background, packs a medical bag.At the home of Dr. Longstreet, the doctor cuts a film reel from its wrapping. Mrs. Frawley, a housekeeper or companion of sorts, startles him by announcing her departure for an evening off, for which the doctor seems most eager.Phibes' car, with painted images of Phibes on the windows, pulls up outside.Dr. Longstreet runs his black and white film reel, gulping wine as he lusts over the image of a snake dancer. Mrs. Frawley's feet appearing below the screen interrupt his private enjoyment. She calls him naughty for not touching his supper yet. Asking about the screen blocking the doorway, Longstreet awkwardly explains it as a modern invention to block drafts. She leaves, dubious of his explanation.Shot of Phibes' car window (bearing Phibes' painted image).Back in Longstreet's study, the film reel leaves the spokes of the projector and its power cuts off. It starts up again to reveal Phibes' fashionable assistant dressed in white. Longstreet is absolutely transfixed. She stops him absent-mindedly cracking a lever in mid-air and seductively pushes him backwards into a chair, tying his wrists to it. Once secured, Phibes, dressed in black and wearing another pendant, switches on the room lights and enters, kneeling down to stare closely at Longstreet. The woman inserts a tube into a rubber-capped beaker as Phibes surgically cuts open Longstreet's sleeve before jabbing a needle into his arm. Longstreet struggles helplessly, managing only to tear the pendant from Phibe's neck.At police headquarters, Trout fumes before Sgt. Schenley over Crow's poo-pooing of the case. Schenley has successfully squashed interest of the press thus far, and has also turned up the fact that all three deceased doctors have worked with a Dr. Vesalius.Trout and Schenley visit the home of Dr. Vesalius, lead in by the doctor's teenage son. The boy is impressed that Det. Insp. Trout comes from Scotland Yard, but not the father, who busies himself with a model train set. Vesalius isn't fussed about the deaths of three doctors until Trout lists off their names (Hargreaves, Thornton and Dunwoody) - all close friends of Vesalius.Back in Longstreet's study, Phibes withdraws Longstreet's blood. As the sun rises, and the woman plays ""Close Your Eyes"" on her white violin, Phibes draws out every last drop. He packs up, leaving eight jars of Longstreet's bottled blood on the mantelpiece. He returns to take a second look at Longstreet's choice of art on the wall - a naked woman and naked child cleaving to a nude male wearing a red cape. Phibes gives Longstreet a last disapproving look and exits.Vesalius finds the death of his colleagues hard to believe. The phone rings for Trout, informing him of Longstreet's death, making it Vesalius' fourth colleague to have been murdered in an exotic manner.Questioning Mrs. Frawley, Trout finds her report of hearing a violin or cello at 2:30 AM astonishing and incredible, but Schenley's presentation of the broken pendant gives Trout a clue he can, at last, pursue.Back at the mansion and ready to burn another wax face, Phibes realizes his pendant is missing.Trout dismisses Mrs. Frawley. Trout and Schenley look at Longstreet, drained dry as a bone.Phibes torches Longstreet's wax image without pity.Visiting the goldsmith who made the pendant, Trout learns it's part of a set of ten, each unique and ordered by a lady who didn't talk much and paid in cash - tall, attractive, young and fashionable. As Insp. Pike - no, that's Trout - leaves, the goldsmith hastens him back to add that the pendant symbols are Hebrew, which noticeably perks up Trout's interest.Visiting a rabbi, Trout learns the Hebrew symbol is part of list of ten curses visited upon the pharaohs of ancient Egypt. Starting with boils, bats, frogs and blood, the list continues with rats, hail, beasts, locusts, deaths of the first-born, and finally darkness ""to end forever the sleep of Man.""With incense burning in his hidden basement chamber, Phibes attaches a cable from a gold phonograph audio horn into the left side of his neck. He then speaks (first time in this film) to an enlarged photograph of a young woman, with his mouth never moving as he sits before her shrine expressing his love.Having gone over his medical history, Vesalius presents Trout his findings: He served 1200 medical cases. Discounting cases over five-years-old (due to Dr. Dunwoody's term of involvement), thirty-six cases involved any two of the four slain doctors, a scant dozen where any three were involved, but only one involving all four. Trout reads the file: Victoria Regina Phibes, whom the doctors were too late to help.Back in his basement sanctuary, Phibes tells the photograph that nine killed her, nine shall die - ""nine eternities in doom.""Trout continues going over the case file. Victoria died, and her husband Anton died in a fiery car crash, incinerated while racing back to be at her side, both now interred in the family vault. They were childless - so who's left to use the ancient plagues of Egypt to commit grizzly retributions?On a back road bordered by a calm river, the door to Phibes' car opens. The fashionable woman, dressed in black with a black fur hat, walks a Grayhound (seen nowhere else in the film). As a car approaches, the dog disappears and the woman peers into her car's engine. The man in the car, a gentleman, instructs his chauffeur to help the lady out. As the chauffeur greets the lady, Phibes' car door opens unnoticed. Straightaway, the chauffeur is rendered unconscious at a touch from Phibes. Phibes takes a lightweight machine from his vehicle, and the woman steps over the fallen chauffeur.Hearing ""Elmer's Tune"" playing outside his car, the slightly feeble gentleman tries looking out his window. The opposite door opens, and the woman places the moving music box figurine inside, soon followed by Phibes and his machine. The physical appearance of both Phibes and victim - jowly, mustached, side-burned, black suited, white dress shirted, gray-eyed - are similar, and they regard each other for a moment.Over coffee, the police discuss the remaining plagues and their placement of guards around all five surviving surgical team members, save Dr. Kitaj, whom they haven't yet located. The money from Phibes' Switzerland account was transferred to England two years ago and withdrawn in cash by a tall attractive woman who rarely spoke a word. Matching the goldsmith's description, Trout is keen upon meeting HER.At the mansion, the fashionable woman finishes sweeping as the clockwork pianist plays, and a recorded voice sings ""One for My Baby and One More for the Road.""It's night. The inspectors reach the muddy backroad where Dr. Hedgepath's car and unconscious chauffeur have been found. With difficulty, Trout opens the car door, frozen solid. Likewise Dr. Hedgepath inside. It's the curse of hail. The constable points out the lightweight machine, connected to the car's running engine to deliver a -100° blast of arctic hailBack at the wax busts, Phibes torches the likeness of Dr. Hedgepath, with its wax dripping on the pendant.At home, Dr. Vesalius plays chess with his son but his troubled mind is elsewhere, and he sends his son to bed. His son hopes to share a ""super"" music piece he's come across through Old Darrow at the music shop, who remembers all the great organists - Bridges, Drew and Phibes. Now Dad's interest is up, and he picks up the music score his son leaves behind.At the music shop, Vesalius picks through old posters to find one on Phibes, dated 1904, and tries to engage dotty, old Mr. Darrow in a conversation about him.Phibes plays ""War March of the Priests"" once again at his organ.Back home with Trout, Vesalius shares his experience of meeting Old Darrow, who can hardly see and seemed to insist that Phibes was still his patron. Trout now wants to visit the Phibes mausoleum.Trout and Vesalius enter a graveyard, with the attendant declaring under his breath that the worms will have these two fools soon enough. Trout reveals that Phibes had degrees in music and theology. Vesalius says it neatly explains Phibes' knowledge of the Egyptian plagues, which Trout hadn't yet connected.Back at the mansion, Phibes sits at his organ, his back to the room. The woman approaches him, dressed in orange and bearing flowers. She gives him the bouquet and he (and organ) descend.The graveyard attendant opens the Phibes mausoleum for Trout and Vesalius. Vesalius asks if anyone ever visits the place. The attendant says no but Trout spots a bouquet of roses on Victoria's burial vault, still with scent. The attendant swiftly but quietly slips away. Removing the vault and coffin lids reveals a small wooden box housing Anton Phibes' ashes. Dissatisfied, Trout speculates that the ashes of the incinerated car crash body might have been that of a chauffeur. Phibes may have survived and returned to London, which could explain Old Marrow thinking Phibes was still around. At Vesalius' suggestion they check out Victoria's body. Her coffin is surprisingly empty.Phibes, back at his wife's shrine, espouses words of love and devotion, promising that they'll soon hold their two precious hearts in single time.Daytime. Sgt. Schenley races along a rural road. Back at the police station, Trout confirms to Chief Inspector Crow that Schenley is heading to meet the elusive Dr. Kitaj. Superintendent Waverley blusters in, confronting Crow while dismissing Trout's presence, to impress everyone what a ticking political time bomb they're in (especially for himself), demanding everyone get out there and bring the affronting madman in.The fashionable lady, dressed again in her black garb with matching black fur hat, exits Phibes' parked car. Sgt. Schenley races past a few brick buildings. Phibes finally exits his car to join his aide and a telescope atop a hill.Dr. Kitaj drives up across open ground to the hanger of the London Aeroplane Club. A youngish man, he whistles as he meets up with Harry, his mechanic, then enters his plane. Sgt. Schenley closes in. Phibes, playing with a wild flower, grins for the first time while his aide plays her white violin and Kitaj's plane readies for takeoff. Schenley arrives just as the plane heads downfield. He racing to catch up, but the plane achieves liftoff. Phibes watches - cold, dour and waiting. Unable to do else, Schenley watches Kitaj's plane as well.With the plane well aloft, rats break out, apparently targeting Dr. Kitaj for meat. Both Schenley and Phibes watch the plane go out of control and - with Kitaj covered in rat bites - crash. Phibes swivels his telescope and applauds. He walks over to his aide and applauds her playing, too (""All I Do Is Dream of You"").Soon after, Trout berates Schenley for not driving faster. Schenley counters that he was at times going over ninety miles an hour and that the car he picked up at Scotland Yard was the fastest he could find and ""damn nearly exploded"" on the journey. With a couple oil seals broken, it's going to need service. Superintendent Waverley suddenly appears, loudly asking Pike - uh, Trout - why his car's been moved. Trout and Schenley both realize what trouble they're in but each refrain from offering details. After inquiries about the Phibes case (and getting Trout's name wrong again), Waverley drives off. Before Trout and Schenley can discuss anything further, Waverley's car can be heard giving up the ghost off camera.Dr. Phibes prepares for a romantic interlude with his aide, lowering a backdrop painting of elegant people at a party. A banner on another backdrop proclaims it Le Casino De Monte Carlo. A fixed spotlight illuminates the woman, dressed in pale blue and lavender, seated at the room's only table, with a rose adornment and a bottle of champagne chilling. Dr. Phibes approaches and pours them each a glass. They clink glasses, and Phibes drinks from the right side of his neck. Gulping sounds can be heard. The woman watches, sipping her own champagne as Phibes finishes. They return their empty glasses to the table, clasp hands and dance. He returns her to the table before the clinking clockwork musicians reach the end of their dreamy, romantic rendition of ""You Stepped Out of a Dream.""Schenley and Trout go over plans for the surviving surgical team members, placing guards around Dr. Vesalius and Nurse Allen while setting about taking Dr. Whitcombe off to the country for a few days.Scene jumps to a men's club where Trout and Schenley escort Dr. Whitcombe out. The doctor is irritable at being removed from his patients for too long a time, but recognizes the royal treatment he's getting from the police. As Schenley takes Whitcombe's leather duffel bag, he and Trout open the double doors, whereby a whooshing sound heralds the head of a brass unicorn piercing Whitcombe's torso and nailing him to a thick, free-standing wooden wall, instantly killing him.As the police unscrew Dr. Whitcombe and the unicorn head from the wall, an old gentleman loudly demands their consideration for quiet.Dr. Phibes puts another medallion around another wax bust before blowtorching its face. His aide, dressed in pink, moves elegantly about the room, catching Phibes' attention briefly.At Scotland Yard, Trout expresses incredulity over the unicorn head (its horn stained in blood) being cast in brass. Schenley adds that it appears to have been catapulted from across the street.Dr. Phibes sits at his organ, watching images of his deceased wife projected overhead. Soft organ music plays. (Supposedly he's playing, but his movements say he isn't.) Phibes, aided by his audio cable, speaks lovingly to his wife's image (taking a few lines from John Donne's poem ""The Good-Morrow""). He declares to his wife's image that his work will be finished in the next twenty-four hours, whereby he'll rejoin his her in her setting forever.At Scotland Yard, Waverley berates Crow for engaging seventy men in a search for a man who was once buried. Trout happens by, and Waverley berates them both for making no difference whatsoever in arriving ahead of a crime for a change. Trout excuses himself for the lavatory, which Waverley declares highly appropriate.Followed by his aide (wearing her black fur hat again), Phibes wheels a brass wheelbarrow filled with Brussels sprouts up a board over his steps to the balcony. His aide watches him, then turns to watch the film audience.In his laboratory, Phibes monitors the Brussels sprouts dropping through a large plastic tube into a large, bubbling cooking pot. The woman, now dressed in yellow with her hair done up, enters with a small amount of more Brussels sprouts in a small serving basket. Phibes picks through them, discarding some but adding others to his cooking pot. A large cylinder holds an agitated amount of clear green liquid derived from the cooking pot. Phibes discards more of his assistant's Brussels sprouts before holding one and nodding approvingly.It's evening, as Trout and Schenley pull up and enter a hospital. A policeman reports nothing to report.In the lab, Phibes checks his cooking efforts, dipping his gloved finger into the brew and then sipping it through his neck. Sip. Swallow. It's good.Checking his map of the hospital grounds, Trout expresses confidence in his security measures to keep Nurse Allen alive, loosing a little steam in saying that only by dropping in by balloon could Phibes thwart his efforts - realizing upon utterance that the inventive Phibes could do just that. Dr. Vesalius asks what if Phibes is already in the hospital. Trout hopes he is, because he'll never get back out.Nurse Allen meets them, asking Dr. Vesalius of his involvement with men taking over her life by disallowing her to leave the hospital. She's distressed over being forced to stay in a guarded room for the next twenty-four hours. They enter the elevator, where (to the audience) it seems Dr. Phibes, dressed as an orderly with his back to them, stands over two large metal containers. Vesalius and Allen remain quite, not wanting to share their discussion with a mere orderly. As they exit at the next floor, the orderly turns and it is, indeed, Dr. Phibes. Vesalius and Allen exit the elevator, whereby Dr. Vesalius resumes his explanation of protecting her from a madman wanting to kill her. Phibes steps to the frosted glass of the elevator door and shuts the inner gate to continue on up to the next floor.Shocked at the news, Nurse Allen doesn't know how she'll be about to sleep. Dr. Vesalius suggests she take a sleeping pill. Allen retorts with a disapproving goodnight, and the policeman standing guard locks her in her room.On the floor above, Phibes wheels his containers into an unused room directly over Nurse Allen's. He plugs in a lamp and unfurls a life-size cartoonish drawing of a naked woman.On a lower floor, Trout supposes Phibes will eventually be stopped by simple human error. Vesalius disagrees. Phibes has had years to hide and plot. If they can throw off his maniacal precision, they might have a chance of stopping him by his own inflexible standards.Phibes drops a drill point between the eyes of the cartoon woman laid upon the bare wooden floor and begins to drill by hand. Camera shot from Nurse Allen's room shows drill coming through ceiling. Phibes brushes wood chips aside to peer through hole and see Nurse Allen sleeping, a few fresh wood chips in her hair. His curse of the pharaohs pendant swings from his neck. He attaches a black rubber tube to his first canister and sticks the other, smaller, clear plastic end in the hole cut into the floor. (Violin music begins to play ""Charmaine."") Green Brussels sprout broth drips over and runs down Nurse Allen's white globe night table light. As Phibes' aim gets better, the slimy broth drizzles over Nurse Allen's hand and face. Camera shows the tube above running out of juice, and another shot of Nurse Allen, still asleep, shows her face entirely coated in green slime.Phibes removes the tube and gazes down, satisfied. He rises to lift the cover off the second canister, which contains rattling locusts. He attaches another black tube to this and to the hole in the floor. A perfect fit. A midsection of clear glass shows the insects marching down the tube with Phibes looking on, excited. He taps the glass to gets the last of the bugs down the tube.Trout and Vesalius sit below, pondering over the final three curses. It could be Vesalius' turn this night as well, but Dr. Vesalius believes Phibes is saving something for him for last. That should mean the mysterious curse of darkness. Trout wonders about the death of the first-born, which Vesalius says shouldn't affect him because his elder brother already died. A horrible thought strikes Trout: what about Dr. Vesalius' first-born (Lem). Alarmed, Trout sends Sgt. Schenley to take two cars to the Vesalius home along with the doctor and report back.A few floors up, Phibes pokes the last bug through the hole.At the Vesalius home, a camera pans the living room, catching a smiling photograph of young Lem in happier times. Dr. Vesalius paces the room while Sgt. Schenley stands in the doorway. The tone is somber. A reflection on the photograph shows Dr. Vesalius gazing at his son's face. He picks up the portrait to gaze at his son more closely while Schenley walks over to gauge Vesalius' state of mind. Schenley then heads out swiftly.At the back of the house, a patrolman reports the back door hanging off, the lock forced, and looks of a struggle upstairs. ""The lad's been taken all right."" Schenley heads back to join Trout, instructing the patrolman to stay with Dr. Vesalius. The patrolman looks sadly down at the son's model airplane he holds. ""Poor little devil.""Schenley, now back at the hospital, runs inside to report the boy's gone with no sign of Phibes. Trout decides to check on Nurse Allen before he and Schenley head off together for the Vesalius home. They enter the elevator.Trout knocks on the Nurse Allen's door, twice. No response either time. That's. not good, and he tells the guard to open it...slowly. Cautiously Trout and Schenley enter to find Nurse Allen's head reduced to a skull, devoid of flesh, picked clean by locusts still prodding about for scraps, a green juice stain on the pillow, and her dark gray hair robbed of color.Back at the mansion and wearing his greasy black robes, Phibes blowtorches the wax likeness of Nurse Allen.Trout and Schenley stand aghast over Nurse Allen.Phibes, at his wife's shrine once more (and changed into off-white robes), speaks of soon being with her in eternal paradise.At the Vesalius home, Trout tries to reassure Vesalius that the police are doing everything they can, and suggests a little brandy might help.Phibes, sitting angrily at his organ with his audio cable still in his neck, dials a phone mounted on his organ, his wife's photograph on the dial.Phone rings at the Vesalius home. Vesalius picks up.Phibes flips all his tabs and plays a bunch of held-down notes.""Who's there?!"" demands Vesalius.Sneering and angry, Phibes hangs up.Cut off, Vesalius hangs up and looks over to Trout. Trout, having watched, looks back to the brandy. The phone rings again. Trout looks to the extension near him, and Vesalius picks up immediately. Phibes speaks. ""Nine killed her, nine shall die."" As Vesalius asks the caller if he's Phibes, Trout picks up the extension and listens in. Vesalius tells Phibes he must see him. He tries to maintain composure but then loses it, demanding to know where his son is. Phibes responds by saying ""The organ plays till midnight, the large house in Muldeen Square, come alone."" Phibes hangs up. Vesalius does too. So does Trout.Vesalius announces he's going alone, hoping to trade is life for his son's, but Trout forbids it. The police will be with him, whether Vesalius likes it or not, sorry. Seeing no way out of it, Vesalius asks to make a quick phone call, which Trout allows, but it's a ruse. Vesalius uses the metallic phone to knock Trout unconscious. Vesalius apologizes and heads out.Back at the mansion ballroom, Phibes' assistant wears a garment of red and gold, including a headdress reminiscent of a sundew plant, with red extensions tipped with red jelly or gemstones. She stands with arms outstretched as Phibes rises up on his organ, red organ backing red dress. As the organ stops, she slowly descends the steps towards the golden gramophone horn below and turns it outward. (Phibes appears to be playing, but the music is foremost a guitar with cello and a pair of unified male and female singers.) A camera close-up of the woman's neck adornment shows it to resemble an assortment of writhing gold snakes.Outside, Vesalius arrives. The woman lets him in.Phibes, at his golden horn, plugs in. The two men meet for the first time across opposite ends of the designed glass floor with the burnt wax figures in the background. Phibes greets Vesalius graciously but announces that his son will die at midnight. Phibes will have killed nine times in his lifetime but asks Vesalius how many murders can be attributed to him. ""None,"" says Vesalius. ""I never killed your wife!"" ""No?"" questions Phibes, and declares he has no faith in doctors. For example, he himself was told by doctors, after his crash, that he would never speak again but were proved wrong by Phibes, using his own knowledge of music and acoustics to recreate his voice. Vesalius says he doesn't need reminding of Phibes' ingenuity and, stepping forward, re-demands to know the whereabouts of his son. Phibes steps forward as well, causing Vesalius to fearfully back away, and reveals that Vesalius will see his son under circumstances that may trigger memories.Lights in a room beneath the glass floor fade up. There rests Vesalius's son, unconscious, under a lavender covering that exposes only his face and center of his chest (and bare feet and arms, seen later on). The boy is restrained to a wheeled table by a metal neck brace, aluminum in appearance, that seems secured to the floor by chains. Vesalius touches the floor: so near and yet so far.Phibes gives the son (already anesthetized) the same chance at survival that his wife had under Vesalius' knife. ""You're wife, no, Phibes, but you I will kill."" ""You can't, doctor. I am already dead,"" says Phibes.The red-dressed assistant leads Vesalius through a hole in the floor down to the room below.Trout awakens in Vesalius' home, drinks the brandy then calls for the sergeant.Phibes unplugs his audio cable from the golden horn and plugs it into the floor along the framing of the glass design. He asks if Vesalius can hear him. In the makeshift surgical room below, Vesalius can. Phibes points out an x-ray of the son's rib cage, showing a tiny key lodged close to the boy's heart that will unlock the restraining halter around his neck. Phibes positions a contraption with a coiling tube to a round hole in the glass floor. Vesalius needs the key to unlock the halter and remove the boy from his fixed position, his face directly below the coil contraption. Acid will soon be released into the tube, where it will creep down and reach the outlet over the boy's face in exactly six minutes. Vesalius, with the woman's help, prepares for surgery. Phibes releases the red-colored acid and watches its progress in the tube. The woman puts a surgical on Vesalius, and he asks her to please hurry.Phibes continues watching the acid descend, almost playfully. Vesalius begins to cut into his son (not directly shown). Phibes leaves the acid contraption, unplugs his cable from the floor and descends into the surgical room.A car, presumably with Trout and police inside, hurries down an alley towards Phibes' mansion.Phibes enters the surgery room where Vesalius works diligently. ""For God's sake,"" utters Vesalius, at which Phibes proclaims to have God on his side. Better for Vesalius to put his faith in his own skilled hands, he says. Phibes directs Vesalius to look above at the acid heading for his son. Phibes turns to his fashionable assistant and addresses her by name for the first time. ""Vulnavia, my work is nearly finished. Go, now. Destroy all I have created."" She leaves and Phibes orders the doctor to work faster, enjoying the added, torturous pressure this puts on him. Phibes' wife only existed six minutes on Vesalius' operating table. Vesalius murdered her, but Phibes has given Vesalius ""a second chance"" (to redeem himself, supposedly) by saving his son in the same six-minute time frame.Upstairs, Vulnavia activates the clockwork musicians into playing ""A Hundred Years from Today."" She tarries at the acid machine (with the red liquid reaching all the way to floor level by now) then walks on to a gold-colored axe embedded in the dance floor.Downstairs, Phibes enjoys taunting Vesalius about not saving his son in time. The son will not only die but ""have a face like mine,"" he says. Vesalius looks up as Phibes tears off his prosthetics to reveal a horrific face, the eyes intact but the front barely covered by ruined flesh, teeth permanently exposed and fused together, and a skull mostly (top, back and sides) exposed. Vesalius turns back to his son, and Phibes slowly backs out of the room, exiting.Phibes walks through the ballroom as Vulnavia continues to hack at things (the wax busts, the canvas painting). Phibes sits at his organ as the clockwork musicians continue to play.Vesalius, still working, sweats.Vulnavia slashes the canvas painting, and now Phibes warms up the organ for one more performance of ""War March of the Priests.""Hearing this from below, Vesalius looks up. His son, still unconscious and oblivious to the horrors around him, lies peacefully.As Phibes plays, drowning out the clockwork musicians, he has a grand time, twice glancing back at Vulnavia's handiwork at the canvas.Vesalius looks up to see the acid beginning to fill a transparent lower dish above his son's head. Vulnavia continues to chop. Phibes and organ begin their descent.Trout, Schenley and several policemen pull up out front.As Vulnavia continues to chop, Trout and Schenley poke their heads through tears in the canvas, unaware their heads appear atop drawings of party-going bodies.Vesalius continues the surgery and sees, by the container above, that he has thirty seconds left. With the acid rising to the ends of tubes that will drip down at nearly half a dozen points over a small area, Vesalius finally extracts the key, but now his hands ARE shaking and he can barely fit the key in the lock. He does, however, and releases his son from his fixed position.Others enter. Trout and Schenley have cornered Vulnavia in the surgical room, with her threatening them with her axe. Unfortunately, she's forgotten about the acid that she now stands under. The acid (having turned a honey color) comes through the eighteen tubes. She screams (the first time in the film her voice is heard). Camera only shows the glass surgical table and chemical steam. She collapses and Trout looks away, sickened. Vesalius says they'll need an ambulance for them (Vulnavia and the son).Back in his private basement chamber, Phibes steadily recreates his face with prosthetics.Vesalius, joining Trout and Schenley, returns to the ballroom. Officers are dispatched to bring the boy up and prepare for the ambulance arrival. Wondering aloud where Phibes went, the organ almost silently rises from below, drawing their attention. The three men ascend the steps to it. Trout warns Vesalius against touching it himself as it may be a trap of some sort. Trout swats a tab nervously to see if there's a reaction.Below, Phibes, finished recreating his face, walks to the other side of the room and raises his right arm. As he unbuttons his sleeve, a light comes on, revealing his wife laid out. Phibes steps into this sunken bed of sorts, with a mirror angled to reflect her as if in a standing position. He lies next to her and jabs a hypodermic needle into his arm. A plastic tube shows blood taken from Phibes spurting out into the first of several empty beakers. Next to them are three beakers marked Embalming Fluid. As the blood flows into an empty beaker, yellow embalming fluid leaves the other. Dr. Phibes rests comfortably and seemingly goes unconscious. The camera moves to the mirror at their feet. It suddenly moves, revealing itself to be a lid with an outer relief design of the sun, Earth and moon, with the moon casting the Earth in a total eclipse.As the lid lowers automatically, Trout, Schenley and Vesalius lower downward on the organ, which grandly plays the conclusion of ""War March of the Priests"" on its own. Having reached Dr. Phibes inner sanctum, the men are confused. Where's Phibes? It's the final curse, darkness, which means to forever end the peaceful sleep of these three men. They turn to leave, and lights dim on Phibes' final resting place, leaving only the sun design illuminated. A thunderclap is heard (more for the sake of the viewing audience than the characters).End credits roll to the melody of ""Over the Rainbow."" As the song reaches it's trumpeted conclusion, the trumpet fails to finish, with the last note replaced unsatisfactorily by a piano. Phibes' wicked chuckle is heard, and the meaning is clear: Just as the song isn't really finished, neither is Dr. Phibes."

Bhaskar was a cancer specialist and after the congratulatory speeches, he reveals that the book is not a work of fiction, but taken from his own diary and pertains to his experiences with a real person named Anand.The flashback starts with Bhaskar, fresh from his training as an oncologist, trying to treat the poor for no charge, but often disheartened by the fact that he cannot cure all the ailments in the world. He becomes pessimistic after seeing the suffering, illness and poverty all around him. He is straightforward and won't treat the imaginary ailments of the rich. His friend, Kulkarni follows a slightly different path. He treats the imaginary illnesses of the rich and uses that money to treat the poor.One day, Kulkarni introduces Bhaskar to Anand (Rajesh Khanna), who has lymphoma of the intestine, a rare type of cancer. Anand has a cheerful nature and despite knowing the truth that he is not going to survive for more than six months, he maintains a nonchalant demeanour and always tries to make everyone happy around him. His cheerful and vibrant nature soothes Bhaskar, who has a contrasting nature and they become good friends.Anand's condition gradually deteriorates, but he does not want to spend his remaining time in a hospital bed; he instead roams freely and helps everyone. He discovers that Bhaskar has strong feelings for Renu (Sumita Sanyal), whom he treated previously for pneumonia. He helps Bhaskar to express his love and convinces Renu's mother to bless their marriage. He tells Bhaskar that everyone should remember him as a lively person and not as a cancer patient. His end comes and he dies amongst his friends and everyone remembers him as a vibrant and lively person. Bhaskar becomes more philosophical and continues to help the helpless with more empathy and maturity."

This film concerns the four-day history of a major American scientific crisis. We received the generous help of many people attached to Project Scoop at Vandenberg Air Force Base and the Wildfire Laboratory in Flatrock, Nevada. They encouraged us to tell the story accurately and in detail. The documents presented here are soon to be made public. They do not in any way jeopardize the national security.""FIRST DAY (February 5, 1971)Two Air Force men, Lt. Shawn (Mark Jenkins) and Sgt. Crane (Peter Helm) peer at the little hamlet of Piedmont, New Mexico, population 68, through night vision goggles. They drive their van into town, all the while they are in direct communication with Vandenberg AFB, Scoop Mission Control. They talk to Lt. Comroe (Carl Reindel) and report progress. They report, ""We see bodies, lots of them."" Before they can retrieve the satellite they are attacked by, ""something in white."" Lt. Comroe calls Major Mancheck.Major Mancheck (Ramon Bieri) requests a reconnaissance flyby over the town. He requests, ""Infrared. A FLIR scan, all sectors. Film to come direct to Scoop."" An F-4 Phantom jet criss-crosses the area taking photographs. The pilot is surprised to see all the dead bodies scattered across a wide area. Mancheck and Comroe review the film. Mancheck declares a State of Emergency, and restricts all personnel to base. He enters a small closet, unlocks a red telephone, and calls a special number. He leaves a message, ""I recommend calling a Wildfire Alert. We have evidence here on film of unnatural death caused by Scoop 7 returning to earth."" He hangs up the phone. Five scientists are activated and collected: Stone, Leavitt, Dutton, Kirke and Hall.A party in an upscale Berkeley neighborhood in California is underway. Mrs. Allison Stone (an uncredited Susan Brown) answers the doorbell. She is surprised when MP Capt. Morton (John Carter) and his aide (an uncredited Michael Bow) appear and insist on seeing Dr. Stone. Dr. Jeremy Stone (Arthur Hill) reacts as if he knew they would arrive which upsets his wife even more than she already is. Morton calmly tells Stone, ""There's a fire, sir."" Morton assures Mrs. Stone that Dr. Stone will be fine and they leave. Stone reviews a file on Project Scoop on the drive to San Francisco International Airport. Allison Stone frantically calls her father, a U.S. Senator, and tries to report the strange abduction of her husband. The phone line is cut and a voice warns Mrs. Stone, ""This communication is being monitored. The connection has been broken for reasons of national security. You will be briefed at the appropriate time. Thank you for your cooperation, Mrs. Stone."" General Sparks (Peter Hobbs) calls Dr. Stone, who is alone on a large commercial jet airliner, and tells him, ""I just wanted to inform you that all members of your team have been cleared and are now being called in, except for Professor Kirke. He's in the hospital: Appendectomy.""At the Dutton residence, Clara Dutton (Frances Reid) packs a bag for her husband, Dr. Charles Dutton (David Wayne). His daughter enters the bedroom with a cup of coffee and asks, ""Germ warfare people, Dad? A lab accident?"" His grandson enters the bedroom, and excitedly exclaims, ""Grandpa, there's a car, and they got guns."" Outside in the snow is a green military vehicle surrounded by three soldiers. At her lab, Dr. Ruth Leavitt (Kate Reid) is working when two Air Force officers inform her of a fire. Her assistant, Bess (an uncredited Midori), gets her some water to take a pill, and tells one man, ""All Dr. Leavitt needs is rest."" The major (Richard Bull) is in no mood for Leavitt's brand of humor, but is relieved when she tells him, ""Relax. I'm going with you."" In a hospital Operating Room, Dr. Mark Hall (James Olson) is just about to make an incision on his patient when the hospital administrator (an uncredited Paul Bellantyne) tells him to break scrub and be in the surgeon's conference room in thirty seconds.SECOND DAY (February 6, 1971)A helicopter takes off from Vandenberg AFB at 8:00 a.m. The pilot, Dempsey (an uncredited James W. Gavin) flies Doctors Stone and Hall, in white space suits, to Piedmont, New Mexico. Stone explains to Hall that the satellite isn't radioactive, but may have brought back a space germ. Hall asks why he was chosen. He is told he is an MD, he knows blood chemistry and most importantly that he is single. Stone is annoyed that Hall has not been reading the Wildfire materials he has been sending the doctor.We jump ahead in time to April 14, 1971 and the closed hearing of the Senate Committee on Space Sciences in Washington, D.C. Senator Phillips, the senator from Vermont (Eric Christmas) chides General Sparks about Dr. Stone. Senator McKenzie (an uncredited David McLean) from New Mexico expresses disagreement with his colleague about Dr. Stone. Sparks relays that Dr. Stone didn't know anything about Project Scoop. He and Stone were consultants with NASA on the Lunar Receiving Lab. Stone felt a more advanced lab was required to isolate and study any extra-terrestrial germ that may be encountered in the future. Stone wrote a letter asking that a facility be funded and built for such a purpose. Phillips objected to the cost, $90 million.In the present day, the helicopter approaches the small town. Buzzards are picking at the dead bodies, so gas canisters are dropped to kill the birds. Stone and Hall investigate the town, while the helicopter hovers a safe distance away. They find the townsfolk cut down in mid-stride, all dead. Some appear to have committed suicide. They retrieve the satellite from the residence of Dr. Alan Benedict (an uncredited Jason Johnson), the town doctor. Hall notes that Benedict's blood has turned to powder, and realizes just how dangerous this new organism is to the world. On their way out they hear a baby cry. They only find two people in town still alive: Jackson (George Mitchell) an elderly wino, and an infant, Manuel Rios (an uncredited Robert Soto). Before they leave, Stone tells Mancheck by radio, ""The town is finished, contaminated beyond all...Order up a 7-12.""In the White House Situtaiton Room, the time is 2:40 p.m. EST. Mr. Grimes (Richard OBrien), special assist to the President, meets with Dr. Robertson (Kermit Murdock), science advisor. A Cabinet Secretary (an uncredited Glenn Langan) advises, ""It's against the Moscow Treaty of 1963 to fire thermonuclear weapons above ground."" Grimes gets a call from the President. He is told that the National Guard will cordon off the area around Piedmont, and a decision to cauterize the area, via a 7-12, will be delayed 24 to 48 hours. Ed, the Assistant to the Cabinet Secretary (an uncredited Walter Brooke) is told to handle the National Guard deployment.Back at the hearing, Sen McKenzie asks who decided on the location for the Wildfire Lab. Sparks tells him that Dr. Stone wanted an uninhabited area.It is close to noon and Dr. Dutton is driving Dr. Leavitt to the Wildfire facility in southern Nevada. The surface structure is disguised to look like an old building run by the Department of Agriculture. They enter the building, and after Dutton provides the guard a pass-phrase, they walk to a storeroom. The floor drops away and they are taken down some distance underground to the first level of Wildfire. Stone and Hall enter a decontamination chamber in their white suits and are irradiated. Dutton tells Leavitt he thinks the capsule may have been brought back with the infection deliberately. Their final step before entry is a palm print analyzer that verifies identification. Dutton tells Leavitt, ""It gives you final clearance to enter Wildfire."" Hall and Stone greet Dutton and Leavitt, then they all proceed to the communications room on Level 1. Stone asks Sgt. Burk (Joe Di Reda) if there are any messages from the White House. Burk is annoyed, but gives them the brief tour of the teletype machine. ""I listen for a little bell in here. Ding-a-ling. That means a message coming in is for the Wildfire Team. No messages yet.""The team changes and meets for a briefing. Stone gives Hall a special red metal key on a chain. Stone arms the nuclear device at the bottom of the complex. He explains that in an emergency it is activated automatically, and Hall's key is the only thing that can disarm it. He further explains, ""There's a five-minute delay between the time detonation locks in and the bomb explodes."" Hall is confused and Leavitt tells him, ""You should have done your homework, sport."" She explains the ""Odd-Man Hypothesis"" that unmarried males are best suited to decide on the use of nuclear weapons. Stone shows Hal, via an electronic diagram, where he can find the stations where he can cancel self-destruct with his key. He also explains that it will take 16 hours to descend to Level 5, and that each level is cleaner than the one above. They start the decontamination and immunization process, the time is 5:10 p.m. On Level 4, they rest for 6 hours and are told to meet after that in the cafeteria.THIRD DAY (February 7, 1971)Hall joins the others at a table in the cafeteria. All they consume is a glass of Nutrient 42-5, which Hall describes as tasting like orange juice. Stone explains, ""Developed for the astronauts. Eight ounces satisfy all daily nutritional requirements."" Stone tells the team he has planned the work in three stages: 1) detection, 2) characterization and 3) control: how to contain and exterminate. They head for Level 5. It is now 4:33 a.m.Hall asks Dutton how he can examine his patients if they are sealed off. He is told that entire rooms are set up like glove-boxes. The two men join Leavitt and Stone in Main Control. Stone is using robotic ""hands"" to open the satellite. They use a lab rat to see if the open capsule has contaminated the air inside the sealed work chamber. Sure enough, when the sealed cage is opened, the animal quakes and shutters and dies in a few seconds. Next they expose a rhesus monkey to the air, and like the rat, it dies in a few seconds. Stone decides that he and Leavitt will scan the capsule, Dutton will do the necropsies on the animals, and Hall will examine his patients.Hall enters the patient exam/med lab complex. He meets Karen Anson (Paula Kelly) and asks, ""What's been done for them?"" Karen replies, ""Just plasma for the old man, dextrose for the baby."" Karen explains the computer, Medcom, handles all medical decisions and lab work. She briefs Hall on the equipment and the body suit glove box. Hall orders blood work, then Karen and Hall enter the exam room via their suits. In the Main Control Room, Stone and Leavitt are examining the satellite with remote scanners. She intimates that what they are searching for was deliberately brought back to Earth. In autopsy, Toby (Ken Swofford) is the technician helping Dutton with his vector studies. Like the medical facility, Toby is in a full body glove box suit. Dutton chides Toby to be more careful and use the ""hands"" to minimize exposure. They verify that Andromeda is still present and still lethal and transmitted by the air. The use of various filters yields knowledge that the size is 1-2 microns: the size of a bacterium. Dutton calls Stone and Leavitt to let them know what he has discovered, so far. Stone and Leavitt start their scan on the inside of the satellite. They eventually concentrate on a small pebble and some green substance that looks like paint. Hall examines his patients and reviews the blood results. He talks to Jackson but gets very little useful information. He tries to examine the baby, but it is clear he has no experience with babies. Dutton calls to show him the isotope scan: it shows how Andromeda gets into the body. As they suspected, it is inhaled, ""The clotting begins in the lungs and spreads outward."" Ruth is tired, and annoyed that Stone will not concentrate on the obvious clue, the indentation and pebble, and of course, the green stuff. They zoom in on the green substance and it flinches and grows under 440 magnification. They examine the green material at 1,000 magnification and both see it move. Stone calls for a technician, then operates the hands to remove the pebble for microchemistry examination. The MIC-T (an uncredited Michael Pataki) arrives and praises Stone's technique with the equipment.Hall now knows Jackson's blood is too acid, but not why. He learns the man has an ulcer, but the still doesn't know why the baby is still alive. Meanwhile, a pilot flying over the Piedmont area at 23,000 feet experiences trouble. The oxygen mask he is wearing begins to disintegrate. His F-4 Phantom jet crashes in Utah near the Four-Corners area. At the hearing, some months later, it is disclosed that messages for the Wildfire team were routed but the alarm, ""was knocked out by a sliver of paper...the sliver had peeled from the roll and wedged between the bell and striker, preventing the bell from ringing."" It is now 12 Noon, and Dutton tells Hall he thinks they are being held incommunicado and that what Scoop found was no accident. ""I suspect they were looking for the ultimate biological weapon."" Stone and Leavitt enter the break room to join their colleagues. Stone proudly announces, ""We've isolated the organism. It's in microchemistry."" At the crash site in Utah, Major Mancheck arrives with his team and they learn about the rubber dissolving from the pilot's recorded mayday call. An investigator informs them that the F-4 does not contain rubber, but a new synthetic called Polycron. It is similar in characteristics to human skin, which explains the human bones found in the Jet. The investigator tells Mancheck that either a chemical reaction or a micro-organism entered the cockpit which dissolved the pilot's Polycron-oxygen mask which caused the pilot to become disoriented from lack of oxygen and it led the jet to crash.Back at Wildfire, the entire team is now in the Microchemistry lab. Their analysis of the rock indicates it is a plastic of some sort. The green substance is even simpler, it is composed of only four elements: Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen. A more detailed analysis indicates the total absence of amino acids. Stone refocuses the group to study of the organism, specifically, ""We're halfway home if we find out what will keep that from growing."" Hall wants to concentrate on his patients, specifically what they have in common. Ruth reviews the growth results, but misses the culture in Alkaline, due to a red flashing message, ""No Growth."" Ruth zones out and does not hear the alarm for the midnight conference.FOURTH DAY (February 8, 1971)Hall, Dutton, and Stone are meeting. Hall concludes it must be a blood disorder. The bickering between Hall and Leavitt prompts Stone to call for a 6-hour rest period. Dutton suggests they requests a code name be obtained: Andromeda Strain is assigned. Hall notices that messages for the team were never relayed to the team. The 7-12 was never carried out over Piedmont. Stone is furious and calls the communications center to chew the Sergeant Out. He demands to talk to Dr. Robertson in Washington, D.C. Grimes and Robertson inform the Wildfire team of the Phantom Jet that crashed and the dissolving rubber. Stone emphasizes that the 7-12 must be expedited (but Stone and the team dismiss the dead pilot's claim of rubber dissolving-incorrectly assuming that the pilot was infected by Andromeda). At about 3:00 a.m. the team isolates a cell piece of the green substance. They discover it is a crystal, which now explains why Andromeda lives without amino acids. It converts energy into nourishment. Despite its isolation in the electron microscope the crystal divides and multiplies. Stone exclaims, ""In a vacuum, bombarded by electrons? It shouldn't even be alive!"" Ruth explains that the growth program shows Andromeda can live on anything, ""Only gas and light affect it."" They finally conclude, to their shock and horror, that a thermonuclear detonation would only allow their new discovery to mutate and grow into a super-colony in one day. They call Dr. Robertson back and Stone directs Robbie to disarm the self-destruct mechanism at Wildfire. When they tell the computer to explain Andromeda's function, it overloads and returns the message: 601. They now know that Andromeda divides and mutates with no Earth-bound checks and balances to stop it. Stone calls up a map simulation to show how it might spread. Dutton and Leavitt are shocked and disappointed to see and learn that Wildfire was developed for germ warfare simulations and Andromeda was already programmed in as the designated weapon. Stone tries to mitigate the situation, then deflect criticism by redirecting their efforts to finding an antidote.A little later, as Hall and Karen are with the baby, a yellow light flashes and a bell rings an alarm. Karen points at the light and explains to Hall, ""Contamination!"" A voice over the PA explains, ""A seal has broken in autopsy. Emergency procedures are in effect."" Hall gets Leavitt on the way to the autopsy lab, but Ruth is frozen in place when she sees the flashing red alarm signal light overhead. She falls to the floor and foams at the mouth with a seizure. Hall has trouble getting help with Leavitt, as the personnel around think she is infected with Andromeda. Karen assists with the treatment when Hall tells her it is only epilepsy. Dutton is in the autopsy lab and admits, ""I'm scared. Oh, Lord, I'm scared."" Stone feeds Dutton pure Oxygen as Hall explains what happened to Leavitt. Hall is surprised that Dutton is still alive. Hall finally concludes that blood pH is the answer. After Hall and Stone run a quick growth program, they finally see that Andromeda can only survive in a narrow band of pH: Acid vs. Alkaline between 7.39 and 7.43. Then Stone notices the lab rat, exposed longer than Dutton, is also still alive. He concludes, ""Andromeda's mutated to a noninfectious form."" Unfortunately, Stone also notices a message on the console, ""EARLY DEGENERATIVE CHANGE IN GASKET."" The Andromeda virus is now consuming the Polycron gaskets around the facility, causing the micro-organism to contaminate Wildfire. With all the gaskets decomposed, another red light and alarm sounds and the doors in Level 5 begin to seal off. Hall is unable to get to a substation to deactivate the 5-minute countdown to detonation. Hall cuts his way through the glove box suit and enters the central core. Gas and lasers protect the area from escaped lab animals. Hall climbs to Level 4, but it is now sealed. He shakes off the shock from being struck by two laser shots: one to the back of his hand and one to his face. He gets to Level 3 and inserts his key in the substation.Hall wakes up in the Infirmary some time later with Karen standing next to him. Ruth Leavitt, with her usual brand of irony, tells Hall, ""Eight seconds to spare. Hardly even exciting."" Dutton tells Hall the super-colony is now off the coast and rain will wash it into the ocean where it will die.At the Senate Hearing two months later, Senator Phillips asks Dr. Stone, ""This cloud seeding business, you absolutely sure it worked?"" Stone replies, ""All reports indicate the experiment was successful."" He further admits they are continuing to study Andromeda at Wildfire and postulates that another biological crisis can occur. The senator tartly asks, ""What do we do about that?"" Stone grimly redirects the question with, ""Precisely, Senator. What do we do?"" We close with a view of a computer simulation of Andromeda growing (showing that although contained, the Andromeda virus remains unpredictable), and then the ominous error message, ""601"" flashing on the screen.End credits"
tt0066773,"['Drama', 'Sport']","Based on the 1970 novella by Peter Handke, Wim Wenders' The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick, completed in 1972, documents the warped journey of athlete Josef Bloch (Arthur Brauss) as he slowly and unhysterically transitions from a professional football goalie to a peripatetic madman.In Vienna. After being ejected from a football match for missing a penalty kick, and angrily resisting what he sees as a bad call, Bloch takes a trolley to a cinema, where he buys his ticket from a female cashier (Erika Pluhar). He watches a Western. Later that night, he books a room, and lazily fiddles with a television on the front desk to catch a re-cap of the day's game. After checking in, he goes outdoors to make a phone call. Despite being told that the payphone isnt working, he tries to call someone anyway, only to fail. Weary, he then waits outside the same cinema he visited earlier in the day, and watches the female cashier get into a car and drive off. Back at the hotel, he asks for a paper. Not having any, the hotel clerk offers him a crime novel instead, but Bloch has walked away by the time he returns with the text. Bloch goes to bed. At breakfast the next morning, he scans the local newspaper, searching for the football game results. He takes a brief walk and enters a sports bar; Roy Orbison's ""Dream Baby"" is blaring from a jukebox, and many pictures of footballers adorn the walls. While looking at the pictures, Bloch strikes up a conversation with a girl standing beside him, and tells her of a former teammate who disappeared after moving to play football in the United States. The two go walking to the girl's apartment building and, while riding the elevator to her room, he touches her suggestively. After a time, they are on the street once more, where they part. Bloch continues his search for the football match results, taking in street attractions and merchant booths along the way. While walking through a dark alley, he is the victim of an attempted mugging; one stopped short by the appearance of passers-by. Shaken, Bloch continues on his way through town, ultimately arriving at the same cinema he visited earlier. He chats briefly with the same female cashier, gets a ticket for a seat with extra legroom, and watches a movie about counterfeiters.After the movie, he stands in a dark alley adjacent to the theater, waiting once more for the cashier to leave. This time, he follows the girl onto a bus, first sitting behind her before boldly moving to her front. Though she appears not to notice him at first, when both get off at the same spot, she allows him to accompany her to her residence, where they then have sex. The next morning, Bloch is the first up. He opens her blinds, and sees (and hears) that she lives near an airfield. While she sleeps, Bloch takes a shower, his face betokening a mix of relaxation and disturbed contemplation. Bloch's shower wakes the girl who, over breakfast preparations, tells Bloch of a recurring dream of hers in which she wears a dress made of money that breaks out into flames at odd intervals. After switching on some Top-40 rock music, she prepares to run errands; Bloch requests that she bring him back a paper. While eating breakfast, formal introductions are made: Josef Bloch, professional goalkeeper; and Gloria, cinema cashier. Gloria remarks that she thought Bloch a boxer first, due to his many bruises. They continue to talk, with Gloria relating a tale of watching a football match with a former beau, and Bloch recalling a flub made during a game, along with his football-related travels to South America and the United States. He takes an interest in one of the postcards Gloria has posted by her mirror. Laid out on her bed, she says she's a collector. Bloch drops the postcard and joins her, stiffly reacting to the playful strangling motions she directs his way with one of her ropes. Suddenly, Bloch reaches out and chokes Gloria dead.We find him next sprawled out on Gloria's carpet, groggy. Aware of what he has done, Bloch wipes every utensil and every surface free of his fingerprints, and swipes the American currency lying on Gloria's table. He then returns to the hotel from two nights ago. After paying the 300 shilling bill, Bloch curiously fakes punching the hotel clerk before walking away. He enters the cinema once more, is found to be sleeping in the seats and is asked to leave. Angrily, Bloch knocks the concessionaire's flashlight from his hands and storms away. The concessionaire files a complaint and, when questioned later by the local police, Bloch reluctantly professes to not intending to knock the flashlight away, saying it was just a reflex. Later, Bloch boards a bus and, in the process of sitting down beside an old woman (Rosl Dorena), American coins spill out of his jacket. When the woman looks at him askance, Bloch casually passes off the coins as money left over from his time spent playing football in the United States. During a long bus ride through the countryside, Bloch completes a crossword puzzle and temporarily disembarks at a country bar, where he plays one record on its jukebox before re-boarding the bus. He rides until arriving at the bus terminus, listening to American rock n roll on his pocket radio. Once off the bus, Bloch finds a free room at a hotel. While being shown to his room (upstairs, adjacent to a bowling alley), Bloch asks the hotel girl if she knows an acquaintance of his, one Hertha Gabler (Kai Fischer). The girl replies to the affirmative, saying Gabler leases the Border Inn by the customs border. The next morning, the townspeople speak of a local handicapped boy who has been missing for three days. Bloch takes a newspaper, and finds that the mysterious murder of a female cinema cashier is front page news. He quickly hides the page, and reads the story of the missing cripple. He then leaves the hotel, and enquires for directions to the Border Inn.After receiving very detailed directions from two women in a store. Bloch has one of them mend his jacket; he also buys shirts. Outside, a cop car drives by, and Bloch becomes visibly worried. He leaves town, and walks on the roadside until he reaches the Border Inn. When he arrives, he is informed by the Inn's female employee that Gabler is sleeping; he orders a beer, establishes that he knew Gabler in days past, and listens as the employee tells him of a man from out of town who tried to force himself on Gabler under the guise of wanting to dig a well, and wanting to see the Inn's cellar. While waiting for Gabler, Bloch finds an unplugged jukebox, activates it, and plays more '50s rock. When Gabler arrives, she says that she saw his name in the paper recently. He's taking a break from the game, he says. She talks about the make-up she dons when out at night, and how it covers her up well. Bloch says he'd know her still by her blue eyes. Before leaving, he helps Gabler move furniture, and says hell stop by again in the morning. While walking by a one-room schoolhouse, Bloch comes upon an old man chopping wood. The man criticizes the local school system, and bemoans how kids today cant speak one proper, original sentence; it's all rote memorization, he argues. The next morning, Bloch mails a postcard at Gabler's; while entering Gabler's place, he grimaces at the weird smell outside. Gabler says one of the neighbors just died. Bloch asks of border guards, rent, and what number Gabler starts with when counting. He says he doesn't count the ones anymore, and adds that he almost got run over this morning while crossing the street for he only saw the second car. Gabler's young daughter, who has been easily frightened ever since the cellar incident, runs in and complains about the dead flies the neighborhood boys have placed under her pillow. Gabler explains to Bloch that the neighborhood boys are staying over until the body is buried, and shoos her girl away. After asking how country people do their loving, Bloch remarks that he saw a woman with a spot of blood on her dress two days back.The next morning at the hotel, Bloch strikes up a conversation with some locals who are interested in the appraisal of items. Bloch then gets a haircut, telling the two women in the shop (Monika Poschl, Sybille Danzer) that he places more trust in male hairdressers. The two women laugh, and say that they had bet on him being either a goalie or a boxer, and both admit to enjoying standing behind goalies and making them nervous. Bloch says he wouldn't be made nervous so easily. He then wanders through the countryside, passing the time staring into a stream. Later, after telling his host at the hotel that he'll pay for the room in the evening, he attends a football practice and exercises behind the goalie, shadowing his movements. Back at the hotel, he wakes up during the night and barfs into his sink. When he arrives late to breakfast the next morning, he admits to the hotel girl that he likes the place. Nevertheless, he becomes very much concerned by a headline in the paper announcing that the cripple boy was found dead in the same stream he stared at the day before. He tries phoning a Mr. Schneider, asks of a football practice, has a difficult time comprehending what is said to him, and is then disconnected. Later, in a meat shop, Bloch laughs with the butcher at the news that the cripple boy's bloated body was mistaken for a mattress, and then returns to the stream. In the evening, he meets the same hairdresser girls from a day before, and tells them of a dream he had. Bloch then wanders into a bus stop bar, meets some guys, and follows them to the cinema. They then embark for a small club, where Bloch meets up with Gabler, and listens to a jukebox spinning '50s hits. He drinks, and starts to play cards with a group of men. Just as the tune ""Gloria"" plays, Bloch, who is blankly staring at his hand of cards, tosses his chips in a guy's face and proceeds to fight him outside, where it is raining steadily. Bloch gets beaten up badly, and is left out in the rain. He stumbles back inside, drinks, and dances wearily with Gabler before returning with her to the Border Inn. There, they discuss diverse things until Gabler begins to rail on him for his slovenliness and messiness. Before the situation becomes any more intense, a border official (Bert Fortell) pops in and requests an umbrella for his walk home. Gabler assents, and Bloch volunteers to accompany the man on his way home. During the trek, the border officer shares with Bloch what it is like to be in law enforcement, how the crime rate in town has declined since the mining of the frontier, and how keen observations and swift reactions to movements are key to successfully catching a crook. Once home, the border officer offers Bloch a drink. He declines and returns to the hotel. Bloch listens to his pocket radio.In the morning, on the way down to breakfast, Bloch encounters a man and asks of the reading habits of the locals. He learns that the guests like to read the newspaper, and that the townsfolk usually read magazines. In the dining room, the hotel girl hands Bloch a paper. On the front page, there is a police sketch which bears great resemblance to him. He wanders away from the hotel, spooked. While waiting at a nearby bus stop, Bloch reads a headline in bold: ""Hot Clue in Gloria T. Mystery?"" When the bus comes, he stares at the driver, and does not board. Instead, he heads to the local football field and observes the ongoing match. While watching, he shares his experiences and his feelings on the game with a salesman (Michael Toost) sitting beside him. Bloch reflects on how hard it is to focus on anything but the ball during a game, and how strange it is to see a goalie running around without the ball involved. During a penalty kick, Bloch tells the salesman of the anxiety which runs through a goalie's head when not knowing what corner the ball will come to, and what the kicker is aiming at.

Vargas (Carlos Montalbán).Meanwhile in New York City, clumsy looser Fielding Mellish ((Woody Allen)) works as a product researcher at General Equipment, where he tests electrically warmed toilet seats, coffins with piped-in music and the new ""Execusizer,"" a gym built into the desks of busy corporate heads. Unhappy with his job, Fielding blames his lack of success on the fact that he never finished college.Fielding has also been unsuccessful in his attempts to date women, until Nancy (Louise Lasser), a politically active college student, knocks on his door, asking him to sign a petition urging the United States to support the revolutionaries in San Marcos, who are rebelling against the new corrupt dictator. Although Nancy is busy with yoga classes and her women's group, Fielding talks her into going out with him. Smitten, he accompanies her to political rallies and riots, and eventually makes love to her.Fielding's newfound happiness is shattered when Nancy, feeling that ""something is missing,"" breaks up with him. She explains that she needs someone who is a leader, more politically aware, and less emotionally, sexually and intellectually immature. The breakup depresses Fielding so much that he quits his job and decides to go to San Marcos, where he and Nancy had planned to vacation. Before leaving, he visits his parents, a surgeon and nurse who are in the middle of operating on a patient, to explain that he will be gone for a while. Disappointed that Fielding has not followed him into the family business, Dr. Mellish tries to give him confidence by insisting that he take over the operation, but his mother gives him her blessing.In impoverished San Marcos, where each peasant has been ordered to pay the dictator his weight in manure, a captured rebel is tortured by being forced to listen to a recording of Naughty Marietta , which prompts him to confess that the rebels are planning a revolution on July 4th. After Fielding checks into a hotel, he receives an invitation to dine with Vargas at the palace.During the meal, Vargas explains to Fielding that he wants to keep his people safe from Communism by exterminating ""a few troublemakers."" Vargas ignores Fielding's point that the rebels are not Communists and sticks Fielding with the bill. After Fielding leaves, Vargas and his men decide that Fielding is ""perfect"" for their plans. Later, Vargas' men, who are disguised as rebels, try to kill Fielding, intending to blame the death of an American citizen on the revolutionaries in order to win United States support for their regime. Fielding escapes, but is then captured by the real rebels, who take him to their leader, Esposito.At the rebels' camp, Fielding is told that Vargas has already reported his death to the newspapers and will kill him to prevent the truth from getting out. The rebels want him to stay and risk his life for their cause, but Fielding believes that being dead is ""a tremendous drawback"" to one's sex life and prefers to remain cowardly. However, he trains with the rebels and learns about guns, grenades, camouflage and first aid. When the camp is low on food, Fielding is sent to raid the town and, with a few other men, enters a café and orders a couple thousand sandwiches, wheelbarrows of cole slaw and some drinks, then has it delivered.Esposito later sends Fielding and two rebels to kidnap the British ambassador to hold as a hostage until imprisoned sympathizers are freed. While sedating the ambassador with sodium pentothal, Fielding accidentally renders his comrades unconscious. When the ambassador escapes, his revived co-workers flee and Fielding grabs a cross and joins a Catholic procession in order to evade some suspicious soldiers.Meanwhile, mistaking the United Jewish Appeal for the CIA, Vargas makes a pact with them for support, and when the rebels attack, he discovers that the Jewish fundraisers offer little protection. Although the CIA does send men, half the agents are sent to fight for the dictator and the other half to fight against him. His regime defeated, Vargas flees to the safety of Miami.After the rebels' victory, Esposito announces that he is the ruler of San Marcos, and orders that the country's official language will be Swedish and that citizens must now change their underwear every half hour, wearing it outside their clothing so that it can easily be checked. These proclamations and others cause the rebels to realize that power has driven Esposito mad. At the request of his comrades, Fielding takes over as president, but it is soon apparent that San Marcos needs the support of other countries in order to prevent future corrupt dictators from seizing control. The problem, Fielding and his close associates realize, is that Americans think of them as Communists, and Communists believe them to be American puppets. In addition, they have nothing to barter for aid, except bananas. Fielding's advisers urge him to go to the United States and raise money, but he knows that, back home, his reputation as an uneducated product tester has no clout.Disguised in a red beard and mustache, Fielding flies to the United States, where he is officially welcomed as San Marcos' leader. There Fielding's interpreter translates by repeating every English sentence in heavily accented English, until men in white coats with a butterfly net arrive to take him away. During a dinner fundraiser at which he is the speaker, Fielding tries to tell a joke about a farmer who has an incestuous relationship with both his daughters, but decides he is telling it to the wrong crowd. Nancy, who does not recognize him, approaches to express her admiration for the leader and, after they go to bed together, Fielding reveals his true identity, after which Nancy remarks that she now knows why something in their sexual encounter seemed to be missing.Meanwhile, the FBI sees through Fielding's disguise and, based on his record of involvement in riots and protests, assumes that he is trying to subvert the government. On the six o'clock news, newscaster Roger Grimsby reports that Fielding has been charged with being a subversive impostor. At his trial for charges of fraud, inciting a riot, conspiracy to overthrow the government and using the word ""thighs"" in mixed company, Fielding acts as his own lawyer. Both J. Edgar Hoover, who comes to court (disguised as a black woman), and Miss America provide testimony against Fielding. Although an acquaintance describes Fielding as a ""warm, wonderful human being,"" the court reporter types that he is a ""conniving little rat."" While the jury passes around a joint, Fielding, acting as both lawyer and defendant, attempts to cross-examine himself, causing the judge to order him bound and gagged. Fielding is found guilty on twelve counts and sentenced to 15 years, but the time is suspended if he promises not to move into the judge's neighborhood.A free man, Fielding proposes to Nancy, and their wedding night at the Royal Manhattan Hotel is covered by Dunphy and Cosell for Wide World of Sports . From their spectator-filled hotel suite, Cosell provides a play-by-play description of the action. In an interview with Cosell after the consummation of their marriage, Nancy states that Fielding was not the best she has had, but also not the worst, and Fielding predicts that their next ""bout"" will occur in late spring. Cosell wraps up the interview by saying that ""they may live happily ever after and again they may not,"" but promises to be there to cover the action."
tt0066817,"['Animation', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Fantasy', 'Musical']","Bedknobs and BroomsticksThe movie is mainly set in a small South Coast English village, Pepperinge Eye, during World War II: an elderly farmer (Cyril Delevanti) is painting out the sign-posts, the Home Guard are exercising, led by General Sir Brian Teagler (Reginald Owen) and Captain Aisley Greer (Arthur Gould-Porter), and Mrs. Hobday (Tessie OShea) is allocating homes to children whom have been evacuated from London (sent to the countryside away from the risk of bombing raids). The three Rawlings children, Charlie (Ian Weighill), Carrie (Cindy OCallaghan) and Paul (Roy Smart) are assigned and reluctantly taken in by Miss Eglantine Price (Angela Lansbury). The children are also unhappy, not least at Miss Price's vegetarian lifestyle, and plan to run back to London, but unexpectedly discover, through her attempts to fly on a broomstick, that Miss Price is a trainee witch, complete with black cat (""Cosmic Creepers"") and fully fitted magical laboratory (""poisoned dragons liver""); and to ensure their silence about this, she presents Paul, the youngest, with a magical bed-knob with which he can cause the bed to travel anywhere.Miss Price is eagerly awaiting the last installment of her magic correspondence course from 'Professor' Emelius Browne (David Tomlinson) of the College of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and is very disappointed when it fails to arrive, the College having closed. Using the bed (song: 'Age of Not Believing'), she and the children visit Mr. Browne in London, where he is revealed as a somewhat shady stage-magician turned street-vendor selling magic tricks: he takes Miss Price and the children to his home, a mansion abandoned because of an USN-exploded bomb in the front garden, where the children play in the nursery and he, astounded that Miss Price can actually perform genuine magic, firstly tries to induce her to form a magic variety act with him (song: 'Eglantine'), and then (after being briefly turned into a white rabbit by Miss Price to force him to be sensible) reveals that he copied all the spells used in his correspondence course from an old book, 'The Spells of Astaroth', of which, however, he only possesses the first half, without the words to the ""substitutiary locomotion"" spell so desired by Miss Price.Mr. Browne decides the other half of the book is likely to be found in the Portobello Road street-market, so all go there the following day to search for the book, meeting amongst others an old-book-seller (Ben Wrigley). After an extensive song-and-dance-number (song: 'Portobello Road', featuring representatives of many nations which were part of the Allied WWII forces, including Scots, Indians and Jamaicans), as the market is closing, Browne is approached by the sinister 'spiv' Swinburne (Bruce Forsyth) who takes him (and the children and Miss Price, and the bed) to The Bookman (Sam Jaffe) who possesses the other half of the book, but this also does not contain the spell words. It is revealed that the spell is actually inscribed on the 'Star of Astaroth', now in the possession of magically enhanced and human-like animals, formerly owned by the sorcerer Astaroth, on the Isle of Naboombu. Paul, who has taken a cloth book about the Isle of Naboombu from the nursery, now activates the bed-knob to take Mr. Browne, Miss Price, and the three children there. (The following section of the movie, on Naboombu, is animation with live-action from these five individuals).Arriving at the Isle of Naboombu, the bed and its occupants falls into the lagoon, where it is washed into a sunken ship, the Beautiful Briny Ballroom where the fish are dancing: Mr. Browne and Miss Price join in (song: 'Beautiful Briny Sea'), and win the prize of a gold cup, but then all the fish disperse on seeing a fish-hook descend, which catches on the bed and draws it and the humans to the surface. There they meet a talking bear, who takes them to meet the King's secretary (a secretary bird): the King (a lion) is in a dreadful rage because there is no-one to referee his football match. Mr. Browne volunteers. The football match, between the King's team, the 'Dirty Yellows' (lion, hyena, gorilla, warthog, crocodile, rhinoceros), and the 'True Blues' (ostrich, elephant, cheetah, hippopotamus, kangaroo - yes, there are more players on the King's side) then takes place, the King scoring the winning goal, and Mr. Browne getting thoroughly beaten up, although not fatally injured, to the disappointment of the medical staff (vultures). After the match Mr. Browne pulls the ""gypsy switch"" on the King, substituting his referee's whistle for the Star of Astaroth round the King's neck: the humans then leave pursued by the King as soon as he realizes what has occurred, who is turned into a rabbit by Ms. Price.Back in Pepperinge Eye, Miss Price asks for the Star, but as it has come from another world, it has evaporated: however Paul finds the five magic words of the substitutiary locomotion spell on a picture of the Star in his children's book. Miss Price tries out the spell, which animates clothing, with initially uncontrolled effect (also affecting the hat of the local curate, Mr. Jelk (Roddy McDowall): song: 'Substitutiary Locomotion'). Mrs. Hobday arrives to inform Miss Price that alternative accommodation has been found for the children - which saddens them. Mr. Browne, fearing a family type commitment, also decides he should return to London, and goes to the station to await the milk-train.However, a troop of German soldiers under the command of Colonel Heller (John Ericson) have landed from a U-boat (submarine) on a raid, and take over Miss Price's cottage for their headquarters. She and the children are taken to the local castle, now a museum, and locked in: they are joined by Mr. Browne, who has also spotted the Germans and managed to turn himself into a white rabbit in order to escape. Using the substitutiary locomotion spell, Miss Price animates the entire contents of the museum, some hundreds of costumes of Vikings, Knights, Cavaliers, Hussars etc., plus drums, trumpets and a trio of bagpipe players, and launches these against the Germans, herself directing them from her broomstick. The Germans, including their sergeant (Rick Traeger) are driven with numerous comic effects back to the U-Boat, although they detonate explosives which destroy Miss Price's magical laboratory. Miss Price is slightly injured, at which the whole substitutiary locomotion activated army collapses. The Home Guard arrive to see the Germans leaving, and to claim the victory. The movie ends with the children remaining with Miss Price, and Mr. Browne joining the army but vowing to return, escorted by the Home Guard (song: 'Old Home Guard')."

tt0066831,"['Western', 'contentRating', 'PG13']","A narrator explains that the year is 1909, and that on the east coast, technology, fashion, the arts, and other versions of progress are all the rage. However, the west, while not untouched by the winds of change, is still a fairly untamed and dangerous land. A perfect example of this situation is given when former soldier and notorious train and bank robber John Fain (Richard Boone) leads a band of old-fashioned gunfighters and rustlers onto the land owned by Jacob ""Big Jake"" McCandles (John Wayne) and his estranged wife Martha (Maureen O'Hara).Jake, a wanderer notorious for his gun-slinging skills and his prodigious wealth, has ridden around the west on various business matters with his faithful unnamed dog, and not been home in nearly a decade. Martha runs the ranch, which has an almost East-coast-style house with servants, with the help of their three sons, Jeffrey (Bobby Vinton), James (Patrick Wayne), and Michael (Christopher Mitchum) . Jeffrey himself has a son, whom Martha has insisted be named Jacob ""Little Jake"" McCandles (Ethan Wayne), after his grandfather.Fain's group arrives on the busy, bustling ranch on a day when most of the men are off on a roundup, leaving the house relatively unprotected save the servants and a few young men out in the yard trying to bust a bronco. Martha sends her foreman Bert (John Agar) to talk to them, but he doesn't like the look of them, and when Fain claims they are looking for work he curtly tells them to go away. Fain refuses to leave, rambling on about how much money it would have taken to build the place. When Bert demands to know what it is Fain really wants, Fain, who wears a long Mexican-style Poncho, draws a gun that was hidden in it and shoots Bert dead. The gunshot throws the house into chaos and the raiders use it to their advantage, riding around and shooting or knifing anything they see moving, even killing a small servant boy and his older sister. Jeffrey runs out with his gun but is shot three times, collapsing on the porch. Fain actually rides his horse through the double-doors into the house, shooting one of the cooks. Martha grabs a shotgun to fight back, but stops when Fain warns her that if he dies, Little Jake - who has run to the stable to hide - will also be killed.Outside, half-Indian gunslinger ""Breed"" O'Brien (Glenn Corbett) tracks Little Jake to the stable house and captures him. Little Jake stabs him in the face with a pitchfork, and in rage O'Brien almost shoots the boy, but Fain rides up and stops him, reminding him their plan is to kidnap Little Jake for ransom. The group rides off, callously throwing the ransom note on Jeffrey's bloodied body as they ride past him and Martha. Martha reads it, discovers the kidnappers want a million dollars for Jake's safe return, and after getting Jeffrey care from the local doctor, sends for her other sons. The Army and the Rangers are also notified and offer to carry the box to the place on the map Fain left. However, Martha, who has a plot of her own, reluctantly sends for Big Jake instead, believing he is the only man 'harsh and unpleasant' enough to deal with the killers.Big Jake, who just rescued an innocent Scottish shepherd from being lynched and hung by his cattle-owning neighbors, hires the grateful man and sends him to a property he has 200 miles south, to sell the sheep. One of the lynching party says he thought Jacob McCandles had died long ago, which irritates Big Jake considerably. As Jake rides away from the herd of sheep, a messenger arrives with Martha's summons. Jake takes the next train back home immediately, where he is greeted by Martha, who explains the situation. Jake asks if Martha has raised the million dollars and she says she already has many times that. He looks in the strongbox Martha has set on the table in front of him - the camera does not show the money, and Jake asks her, after an incredulous look at the contents of the box, if this is what she wants. Martha tells Jake that lots of people died in the raid, many of which he knew, and she believes the killers should be given 'exactly what they asked for'. Jake agrees. Martha gives him the weapons and supplies and horses she has waiting for him, as well as a mule to carry the strongbox.Jake goes outside the train station to encounter a group of Rangers, with new, state-of-the-art REO automobiles. After expressing surprise Jake is still alive after all these years, they offer to ride along with Jake and help him retrieve his grandson, but Jake tells them he'd rather not risk their lives. He sends a messenger to fetch someone named Sam Sharpnose (Bruce Cabot). He then meets his son James, who is more than a little embittered at his father's absence and expresses his displeasure almost immediately, repeatedly and derisively calling Jake ""Daddy"". Jake decides to teach him a lesson by throwing him off his horse and into a mud puddle, much to Martha's amusement. James tries to throw a punch and is knocked back in the mud. Jake tells him he can come along but that he'd better use his gun better than he fights if he hopes to stay alive. He also warns James he'll knock him cold if he calls him ""Daddy"" again. The group is about to set off when James' brother Michael arrives on his own state-of-the-art machine - a motorcycle. Unlike James, Michael is delighted to see his father again and is also much more gentlemanly of manner. Jake is less than thrilled to see Michael, however, as the motorcycle spooked the horses and Jake ended up being thrown into the same mud puddle James was in a few minutes earlier.Michael tells the rangers he saw the kidnappers heading for a canyon and that he thinks the cars can outrun them. Martha decides, against Jake's wishes, to take the gamble and send Michael and the rangers to ambush the kidnappers in the canyon. James recants his desire to ride with Jake and goes with the rangers. Martha and Jake have a falling out over this - remembering why it was they were estranged in the first place, as their personalities clash - but Martha tells Jake to still ride off, and that if they fail, it's up to him to bring the boy in. Jake rides off to meet Sam Sharpnose, who is an elderly Apache Indian and an old hunting buddy of his. Sam brought a saddle and puts it on one of the horses, riding off with Jake.Many miles ahead, James is riding with the rangers in one of the cars. Michael goes ahead of them and scouts, but this time can't see the kidnappers. He returns and rides alongside the lead car, shouting to its driver that he can't find the kidnappers but still thinks they should chance the pass. James agrees it's a good idea, but one of the rangers (Chuck Roberson) reminds them that, not knowing if they're ahead of or behind the kidnappers, it's a potentially deadly gamble. However, Buck (John Doucette), the leader of the rangers, says he wants to get the boy back safely to his mother and will take any risk necessary.Unfortunately for them, the first ranger was right in his assumption. The kidnappers are ahead of them and have set up an ambush of their own, and fire a rain of bullets and buckshot on the rescue party. One car crashes into a gully, the other two have their tires blown, and several rangers are injured or killed. The eldest of the gang, Pop Dawson (Harry Carey, Jr.) suggests that with the group unable to follow them, they can call off the attack. Fain insists they murder as many as they can before they leave, to convince the McCandles' to cough up the money. Michael recklessly drives his motorcycle in amongst the kidnappers to distract them. They fire at and narrowly miss him, and he rides by the horses, trying to spook them. Fain realizes what Michael is trying to do and calls off the ambush, his gang fleeing to the horses. In the commotion, Little Jake manages to work his bonds loose and flee. Unfortunately, O'Brien sees him, and for a second time captures him. Michael's motorcycle is disabled from riding over the rough terrain, and he disappears over the edge of the canyon.Big Jake and Sam arrive on the scene. Jake tells Buck that he has little sympathy for him - he made it clear he disapproved of the risky plan back at the train station, but Buck went along with it, and nearly got Little Jake killed in doing so. He gives them some supplies but can't spare any of his horses, and tells them he'll send a telegraph back to their office when he gets to the next town. He also warns Buck that if he finds out the kidnappers have done away with Little Jake, he'll come back and kill him. James reluctantly rides along with his father, but is in even a worse humor than before. Sam reminds him that, like it or not, Jake is more experienced and knows what he's doing. They find Michael's motorcycle crashed at the bottom of the canyon and fear he may be dead. However, when they arrive, Michael's ""body"" stands up and cheerfully greets Jake, saying he just lay still because he thought it was the kidnappers coming down the canyon. Jake demands Michael remove his motorcycle goggles. A confused Michael complies and Big Jake promptly punches him twice in the face - once for scaring him to death and the other for being overeager and nearly getting Little Jake killed. Michael refuses to be bitter, instead ruefully smiling and telling his father that next time he'll just leave the goggles on so he can't hit him.The two boys join their father and ride off, following the map the kidnappers drew on the ransom note. Along the way, more friction arises between James and his father, though Michael tries to calm it down. The situation comically worsens when Jake discovers James has been limping because, during the shootout with the kidnappers, someone with a sense of humor plugged him in the backside. Jake, with the help of his dog and Sam, forces James to undress so he can tend the wound.The next day, Sam, an excellent tracker, determines that they're getting close to the kidnappers. He also presents James and Michael with saddles for their horses, saying he ""found"" them (implying he stole them). Jake says he suspects they may be followed, so Sam rides back to check and returns with news that they have someone following them a few hours behind - he could hear their horses' hoof beats. Jake orders that Sam rests his horse. He also has James take the horses, dog, and the mule with the strongbox for water. He notices Michael has a new gas-powered handgun with a magazine handle. Having never seen an automatic handgun before, he wonders if it's any good. Michael explains it's a preproduction Bergman that was given to the family because they own some stock. Jake asks Michael if he can shoot and Michael says proficiently. However, he seems alarmed when Jake asks him to fire the automatic handgun, and proceeds to demonstrate, by wildly firing all over the place thanks to the recoil, that he has no idea how to use it. After rescuing the mule, which ran off, and assuring Sam and James and Dog they can come out of hiding, Jake confronts Michael. Michael then explains that what he shoots proficiently with is a high-powered rifle with a telescopic scope, and demonstrates his prowess on a deer a quarter of a mile away, when Jake asks him to kill it for meat. James takes the handgun from Michael and starts practicing with it, enjoying the feel of it.That night, in camp, James again harasses Jake, trying to get even with him for running out on them. Jake tells James that he is making up some the things he's accusing him of, and Michael backs him up, causing James to go outside the camp and sulk. Sam alerts Jake that someone is approaching the camp from the front, and though their followers are still a couple hours behind them. Sam offers to kill the intruder, but a shocked Michael, who doesn't believe in killing except when absolutely necessary, protests. Jake reluctantly lets the intruder into the camp while Sam, James, and Michael go hide. The intruder turns out to be Fain, who rides into the camp alone. He pretends to be just the messenger boy for the kidnappers, giving Jake the boy's undershirt as a guarantee of good faith. He then tells Jake that the gang is waiting for them in the next town, and asks to see the money in the box. Jake refuses, saying Fain can help himself to the box once they have the boy. Fain demands to know who Jake is and if the boy means anything to him, but Jake only tells him that he was hired by the McCandles. Fain then warns Jake that they are indeed being followed by bandits intent on stealing the box, but these bandits aren't with the kidnappers. He also tells Jake that if the bandits get the box, he and the others won't wait but will kill the boy and send his body back home through the post. Jake tells him he'll heed the warning, and Fain rides off into the night.Sam tells Jacob that two of the bandits have crept closer to the camp than he thought, and have surely overheard where they're taking the box. Jake, much to Michael's horror, orders Sam to kill them before they report back. Sam and the dog sneak back into the trees to attack the spies. Sam manages to knife one but the dog is unable to bring down the other, and he escapes, though badly mauled. Jake knows this means the bandits will ride ahead of them through the night and lay a trap for them in the town, and they make preparations to deal with the threat.The next day, they arrive in the town only to discover a huge fiesta is going on because a large group of oil drillers is in town. This will make protecting the box and picking the bandits out from the crowd harder. Instead of trying to sneak in, they ride boldly down the street with all their guns out and the box in plain sight. Jake explains to a skeptical James that this shows the bandits that, at least for now, they can't have the box and buys them some time. They check into the local hotel, and once again Jake has to deal with someone incredulous he's still alive. He swears he'll shoot at the next person who says he's supposed to be dead. Michael suggests they hole up in the hotel room and wait for the bandits to make a move, but Jake says he'd rather be proactive and get the bandits first. Michael protests, and Sam tells him to shut up and let Jake do the planning, as Michael's good intentions have already cost some lives. Jake lays out the plan of campaign to the boys, and they take a rest until dark.That night, the plan is put into action. James goes down and joins the fiesta in the saloon, dancing and enjoying himself. Sam goes out to check on the horses in the stable, and Jake grabs a pack of supplies and his shotgun, all rolled up in a blanket, and goes for a walk. Michael is left alone with the dog and the box. Naturally, the bandits begin to close in on them. Jake walks into the saloon where James is and picks a fight with the biggest man he can find. The brawl spills onto the street and everyone's eyes are on it. This gives Sam time to sneak over the roof of the hotel and into the room with Michael, and the two use the mattress to barricade the door. Jake then halts the brawl by apologizing to the man he attacked, claiming he mistook him for someone else. He leaves the saloon, and the fiesta continues. He goes into the barbershop, sees 'hot showers' advertised, and goes to the back to take one. A bandit immediately goes back, sees the roll of supplies and clothes on a bench, and proceeds to hold Jake at gunpoint, believing him naked and unprotected. Two of the Bandits try to rile James up to get him to start a shootout with them, so he can't go protect his brother and the box. Impressively, the normally hot-tempered James manages to stay calm long enough to buy some time, before drawing his automatic handgun and dispatching both bandits with ease. At the same time, the remaining three bandits converge on the hotel. The dog knocks one down the stairs, breaking his neck, and Sam and Michael kill the other two after a brief firefight. The bandit in the barbershop, hearing the firefight, thinks his men have killed Michael and gloats to Jake. However, Jake had taken his gun in the shower with him and rolled the pack back up to look like the shotgun was still in it. He fires the shotgun through the door of the shower, killing the last bandit.Jake returns to the hotel to make sure everyone is all right and is confronted by an enraged Michael. One of the killers blasted open the box in the firefight, and Michael has discovered there are newspaper clippings in it instead of money. James sees the clippings, and immediately begins calling Jake ""Daddy"" again, angrily demanding where the money is. Both sons are convinced Jake has stolen it, and that they risked their lives and killed those men for nothing. After letting both take out their anger by hitting him as hard as they can, Jake engages them in a proper fistfight knocks them out cold, wakes them with water, and manages to get them to calm down. He explains to them that Martha put the clippings there because, as she said, she wanted the kidnappers to get ""exactly what they asked for"" - death. She wants Jake to kill the kidnappers, not pay them for all the death and misery they caused. The boys are skeptical at first, until Jake reminds them their brother Jeffrey is on death's door because of the kidnappers. Realizing that this is indeed something their mother would do, though still a bit shocked by it, Michael expresses concern that they won't be able to pull of the gamble.Once the town has settled for the night, Pop Dawson comes to the hotel room. Michael goes through the window onto the roof when he hears him coming. Dawson doesn't notice Michael is gone, and tells Jake that they have the boy nearby and that they are to follow him, and that if he doesn't get back in 18 minutes Fain will kill Little Jake. He also tells Jake that they are not to move from the trade spot until an hour after the trade or the boy will die. Jake asks how they could possibly accomplish this if they have the money and he has the boy, and Dawson says that they have a sharpshooter of their own, Duffy (Dean Smith), who will be set up like a sniper in a secret location with a telescopic scope and a bead on Little Jake. If anything goes wrong, he has orders to fire, and will be too far away for the kidnappers to stop him. Jake asks Dawson for five minutes to get dressed and ready and Dawson agrees, going out back to wait. Michael comes back in and Big Jake orders him to sneak in unseen and shoot the sniper. They head downstairs, leaving Michael behind. Dawson suspects a trick at once, but Jake tells him Michael was killed when they were fighting the bandits. When Dawson demands to see his body, Jake reminds him all the bodies are laid out in the jailhouse and tells him he's welcome to go have a look if he likes. This seems plausible to Dawson, who is a wanted man and won't go near the jailhouse anyway, and he leads them off through the deserted streets as thunderclouds begin to roll in. Michael waits until they are a good distance away, then creeps along unseen in the shadows behind them.Dawson leads them to an old stables next to an old church. Two dead night watchmen proclaim the kidnappers have already been here and claimed the place as their own. Dawson orders James and Sam to stop where they are, and tells Jake to take the box in alone. Pop Dawson then rides off and hides in the shadows himself. James notices O'Brien also watching them from the shadows and warns Jake to be careful. Jake tells Sam they'll have to go up to Montana and hunt elk sometime after this thing is over, indicating he fully intends the plan to come off. Michael sneaks in alongside Jake, unseen by the kidnappers, and then climbs an old silo, setting up his own sniper's nest and looking for the other sharpshooter.Jake is met by Fain, this time left in no doubt that Fain is the head of the gang. Two of the kidnappers try to sneak up on him, but the mule kicks one and the dog attacks the other. Jake then notices that Fain's younger brother Will (Robert Warner) is up on a wall, aiming a shotgun at him. He jokingly tells Fain that they must figure he's a real dangerous man and Fain, appreciating the humor, tells Will he can get down from the wall. Jake then refuses to hand over the money until Fain shows him the boy. Will and a machete wielding thug named Goodfellow (Gregg Palmer) bring a horse bearing Little Jake out into the light. The boy is bound and hooded. In the belltower of the church, the sniper takes aim at Little Jake's heart, ready to fire should anything go wrong. Michael, however, still can't see him in the dark. Jake orders the hood to be removed so he knows it's the right boy and that he's not hurt. The hood is taken off, and for the first time Big Jake gets to see his grandson in person. He allows a smile to go across his face, and Fain takes that as a sign Jake has something planned. He immediately warns Jake that if anything goes wrong - ""your fault, my fault, nobody's fault"" - Will has orders to blow Little Jake's head off with the shotgun. He also reminds Jake that even if Will is hurt, Duffy can still take him out with the rifle, so no matter what happens, if anything goes wrong, the boy dies.Jake throws the key to Fain and tells him to open the strongbox himself, seemingly disgusted. Fain picks it up and cockily opens the box, kneeling down to take a look at it. This puts him in a vulnerable position. He sees the clippings, looks up in rage, and sees that Big Jake has the shotgun aimed right at his head. The lid of the box blocks this from the view of the rest of the kidnappers. Big Jake whispers to him that it's Fain's turn to follow orders, and that if anything goes wrong, it's Fain that will have his head blown off.For a moment, it seems the victory will be easy, but then a gunslinger named Trooper (Jim Burk) , who was behind Jake unbeknownst, leaps over the nearby wagon and jumps him. Fain escapes and gives the order to kill the boy, but Big Jake kills Will before he can shoot, and the dog pulls the boy off the horse, making the rifle miss and hit Big Jake in the leg instead. Fain shoots the dog, Big Jake fights Trooper off, and a gunfight ensues between the remaining kidnappers and Big Jake, who manages to get himself and his grandson to cover behind some hay bales. Michael spots Duffy by his powder flare and shoots the bells in the tower, making him jump up and be more visible. He then shoots Duffy, who falls from the tower. Fain sends Goodfellow to check on Will, but he's dead. Further enraged at his brother's death, Fain orders Goodfellow to get the shotgun from Will and they continue firing at Big Jake. Sam shoots Trooper from the top of a wall before he can kill Jake, but Fain knocks Sam off the wall with a shot, and Goodfellow brutally hacks the wounded man to death with the machete. Michael then climbs down from the silo, but drops his rifle in the process and has to go look for it.Behind the haystack, Little Jake, still unaware of his rescuer's identity, helps him tie up the wound on his leg. Jake gives him a tiny Deringer gun from his belt and tells Little Jake to run for it, and meet James outside. He then creates a distraction by firing, and the boy runs outside. Goodfellow, Dawson, and O'Brien pursue him. James kills Dawson and little Jake shoots at Goodfellow but misses, and O'Brien wounds James. Little Jake runs to the stables and hides behind a column. Goodfellow spots his shadow and runs after him, but the wounded dog jumps him and mauls him into a bloody mess. Goodfellow manages to get the dog off and hack him to death, same as Sam, but Little Jake is now nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, O'Brien, who likes old-fashioned gun duels, decides to have a little fun with James. He knows James only has one working arm now, and teasingly challenges him to a fight. However, James has now mastered the fast-firing automatic, and when O'Brien goes for his gun he blasts four bullets through him.Fain and Goodfellow are now the only two kidnappers left. James is still outside and Michael and Little Jake are nowhere to be seen. Big Jake decides to make a run for it, throwing a lantern at Fain and catching the signature Poncho on fire. While Fain is putting it out, Big Jake goes to the stables to make sure his grandson is all right. He finds Goodfellow tearing apart a haystack, in which the boy is hiding, but he hasn't found the boy yet. The big man charges Jake with the machete, as Jake shoots only to find he is out of bullets, but Jake grabs the nearest thing to hand - a pitchfork - and impales him on it. He then grabs his grandson, but Fain rides in on his horse, aiming at both of them and gloating that he's going to kill them both. Michael saves the day, appearing over the wall with his rifle and blowing Fain off his horse. Before he dies, Fain one last time demands to know just who his adversary is. Jake tells him the truth this time, and Fain collapses, his last words being that, like others before him, he had heard Big Jake was dead already, much to Big Jake's irritation.Little Jake, hearing the name ""Jacob McCandles"", is delighted to realize his savior is his grandfather. Michael apologizes for being a bit slow and allowing his father to get wounded, but Jake reassures him that he saved his life twice that night and has nothing to be sorry for. Little Jake asks and gets confirmation that Big Jake is indeed his grandfather, and James, nursing his wounded arm but much matured by the experience, appears on the scene. He respectfully addresses Jake as ""Dad"" and suggests they all go home, to which Jake replies that is a good idea."

When she arrives, she suffers yet another beating after telling her father what's going on, runs away again, and is found asleep in a field by Billy Jack, who helps hide her at the Freedom School.At first Bernard Posner seems like a sympathetic character when he refuses to shoot any of the wild mustangs on the reservation to sell as dog food like his father wants him to, but after helping to cause much trouble for the Freedom School in the hopes of making his father proud of him by harassing female pupils and verbally and physically abusing other Freedom School pupils, especially the Native Americans; raping Roberts, and ultimately shooting and killing Martin, a gentle Native American who befriended Barbara and taught her that there are ways to gain love other than through easy sex, it's clear that Bernard deserves little or no sympathy, although he does admit to wanting to make his father proud despite hating him.Deputy Sheriff Mike, as well as the Posners and many if not most of the townspeople, hate both non-whites and peace-loving whites. The hatred and resentment grows as it becomes known that the Freedom School is not only open to at-risk kids of all racial/ethnic backgrounds, but is also an unconventional school with few rules.In the wake of Martin's murder, as well as the rape of Jean, despite Jean's warnings about the possible resulting dissolution of the Freedom School and harm to its pupils.

Meanwhile, the kids at the Freedom School gather outside to see Billy Jack off, giving the Black Power raised-fist and shedding tears."
tt0066842,"['Comedy', 'Drama']","Shrewdly observed and brilliantly understated, ""Bleak Moments"" is a rare early work from Academy Award nominated British filmmaker Mike Leigh (""Secrets and Lies"", ""Naked"").
Brimming with the edgy realism and quirky wit Leigh has become known for, ""Bleak Moments"" follows Sylvia (Anne Raitt), a bored, emotionally numb secretary, as she desperately seeks release from the pressures of caring for her 29yearold mentally ill sister (Sarah Stephenson).
Sylvia seeks distraction first in an awkward flirtation with a quiet schoolteacher (Eric Allan) and then with the tenant living in her garage, a disheveled, guitar - playing hippie (Mike Bradwell) who seems to offer escape from the bleak moments of her life.
Like eavesdropping on the most intimate episodes in a stranger's life, Bleak Moments is an authentic, poignant and often hilarious portrait of the denizens of London's dreary row houses and the fleeting but significant moments which define our lives."

Before she passes him, he notices her hand on the stair railing having fur and claws.Ellen looks out the window as they are removing Rosalind, remarking how there is no telling what will become of her after being in that asylum. The Judge also watches from his window. He turns and notices that the birdcage is empty.Ellen calls to the Judge, saying that Isobel has disappeared. He goes upstairs to investigate.The next day at school, Fallowfield is teaching from the Bible. He asks why Boaz was generous towards Ruth. No one answers at first, but then Mark answers that because he was a man and she was a woman. One girl opens up a small pouch and screams. Fallowfield seizes it and pulls out a furry claw. Cathy screams and Fallowfield drops it on the floor. It is picked up and the pouch sent person to person behind their backs. Finally ending up with the pouch, Fairfield empties it. The claw is missing.The search party returns to the house, informing the Squire that they found nothing. He tells them to search again. Mumbling against him, they reluctantly turn around.Squire tells the Judge that the searchers have lost the scent but that Isobel must have the constitution of an ox. The Judge reminds him that she was ill. Peter, still devastated from what happened to his fiancée, listens to their conversation out of their sight. Squire leaves, patting Peter on the back. As the Judge approaches, Peter remarks that he believes that evil has entered the house. The Judge tells him he must cleanse his mind of such fancies. He tells Peter that they each should go to their rooms for the night.Peter, having remained downstairs staring at the fire, decides to go upstairs to bed. Coming to the attic room, he enters and sits on the bed. He picks up the nosegay, smelling it and lying down.The light by his bed goes out and he hears rumbling noises from under the floor. Rising and looking at the floorboards, he observes one of them rising up. When it rises several inches, he puts his hand down in the opening to feel around. Suddenly his hand is grabbed by something. He struggles to free his hand from the grip. As he pulls it out of the hole, we see it was grabbed by a furry claw. He covers the board up by putting an old chest on it. The furor ceases and he lies down to sleep.Later we see the claw creeping up and grabbing him. A struggle ensues and Peter reaches for his knife, hacking at the claw and crying out.Coming in, the Judge sends Ellen for bandages. He notes that Peter has severed his own hand.The doctor shows the Judge an old book containing illustrations of demons and devils. The Judge says that witchcraft has been proven untrue. The doctor tells him to look at a drawing of a devil which looks like what Peter described. Peter stirs and the doctor attends to him, saying the drug has worn off. The Judge asks the doctor if he can borrow the book, saying he would like to study it further.As the Judge is leaving, Ralph asks that he continue to help them. He promises to return when the time is right. Squire tells Ralph not to spread any more tales of witchcraft. The Judge tells Squire that the evil must be allowed to grow before it can be destroyed.Mark and his sister Cathy are returning home in the woods. Mark tells of a pain he feels. She begins praying the Lords Prayer with him as they journey on.At home, Ellen says she will fetch the doctor for Mark. Mark says the pain is gone, but Ellen insists that she will only be gone a short time and will return with the doctor. She tells him to eat an apple and leaves. Mark plays with some small bones he has collected. Standing to pick an apple, he feels the twinge in his side again. He sits and takes a bite of the apple as two girls gaze at him through the window. They enter and ask him to join them to play. He mutters that he doesnt play girls games. They tell him that Angel wants him and that they have been taught new games. When he hears that Angel wants him, he accompanies them.The next day at school there are several absent. Fallowfield asks where Mark is, only to be told that he is sick at home. Asking where Angel Blake is, he is told by the red-haired boy (Denis Gilmore) that she sends her regards and apologies that she has something fearfully important to do. Fallowfield shows his anger, remarking that he does not like the insolent ungodliness he sees growing in the children.The members of the coven are playing blind mans bluff with Mark as the victim. He blindly reaches out, trying to touch someone as they all run around him giggling. Finally he stops suddenly as if sensing something. He is grabbed around the neck by a cord.Returning home through the woods, Ellen carries a bottle of medicine. Suddenly the bottle smashes and she is shocked. She looks around and sees a young man smiling at her. She tells him that the bottle contained medicine for Mark. He laughingly replies that Mark will not need it anymore and has been shod in the woodshed. Ellen returns to the woodshed and is horrified to see the bleeding body of Mark underneath the woodpile.Fallowfield is seen with his rabbit in his chambers. Angel enters and approaches him. He calls out to her, telling her that he wants to talk to her. He says he will discuss with her father her insolent behavior. Angel disrobes and asks if he likes what he sees. He rebukes her and tells her to cover herself up. She comes close, telling him that they want him to come and participate in their games. He curses her, saying he doesnt ever want to see her there anymore. She curses him, saying that if he wants to see what becomes of his pupils, Mark has already succumbed.Next we see the graveside service for Mark, with Fallowfield reading from the Book of Common Prayers. Angel and her father (Godfrey James) come up behind the others and wait. As Angel concentrates her gaze upon Fallowfield, he is distracted and looks repeatedly at her. The wrapped corpse is lowered into the grave and the final words are spoken. Cathy feels a pain and turns to see Angel looking strongly at her.As people are leaving, Fallowfield follows the Squire, asking to speak with him. Angel and her father also approach to speak to the Squire. Telling Fallowfield to wait in the church, he listens as Angel and her father tell the Squire that Fallowfield demanded that Angel strip and submit to him or she would end up like Mark. They convince him that Fallowfield is guilty and the Squire promises to put an end to it.Returning home through the woods, Cathy feels another pain. She tells Ellen that its nothing serious. Ralph comforts her, calling her  my love.  He turns to go another direction as Cathy rushes to join Ellen, telling her that Ralph spoke of her that way.Cathy is approached by two boys from the coven. One of them is cracking a whip (the same whip that smashed the medicine bottle). They claim they are upset about Mark. She asks if they have seen Ralph. Saying no, the red-haired one runs up to her. She tells him she is picking flowers for Marks grave. He insists that he knows where some large flowers are. She asks where and he offers to show her.They lead Cathy through the woods and along a path. One of the boys jumps down on her, tying a rope around her. She screams, saying they are hurting her. They insist its just a game and take her on. Her screams are heard in the distance by Ralph who is driving a carriage home. He sets off looking for her.They lead her into a clearing where Angel places a crown of thorns and flowers on her. They are joined by other members of the coven. Ralph continues to search for her and call her.Meanwhile Fallowfield is arrested, charged with ravishing Angel Blake and is a suspect in the murder of Mark Vespers. He insists that Squire has made a mistake.The coven leads Cathy to the ruins of an old church where she is summoned to the front to be offered to the furry clawed creature of their worship. All at once Cathy is pushed to the ground by Angel. Pulling up the back of her dress, Cathy is seen to bear the mark of the beast.Ralph happens upon the woodsman Ned Carter (Jason Twelvetrees) who lives in a shanty in the woods. Questioning him about Cathy, Carter tells Ralph he saw a group of young people being led by Angel Blake. He doesnt remember seeing Cathy at all.As members of the coven strike her with flowered branches, one boy approaches and disrobes. Other boys tear the clothing from Cathy, who is horrified.

Her screams are heard by Ralph.Angel repeatedly stabs Cathy and leaves her to die. Ralph finds her bloody body.Squire leads men with Fallowfield into the barn and begins to question him about the death. He denies it, saying he knows not how the death occurred. They are about to judge him when Ralph comes up carrying Cathys body. Ralph tells them that Angel and her coven did this. Squire orders the Reverend to be released and calls for the men to seek the coven members. Peter approaches and gazes sadly at Cathys body.Peter saddles his steed and rides to the Judges house, telling him how things have deteriorated in the village. The Judge is persuaded to return, telling Peter that he will use undreamed of measures.Margaret (Michele Dotrice) is seen running from a mob of men. They capture her and throw her into a pond as a witch. Hearing their struggles, Ralph approaches just as she is hurled into the water. He demands to know what they have done. Telling him that they have done in a witch, they all seem pleased. He asks how they knew she was a witch. They reply that if she floats, she is a witch. Ralph tells them that if she drowns, they have become her murderers. They become sullen and leave. As Margarets body floats to the surface, Ralph wades in to retrieve her.Back at the house, Ralph tells Ellen that he rescued her from the mob who was trying her as a witch. Margaret stirs and Ellen calls for her to be moved by the fire. She tells Ralph to fetch Cathys bed to put the girl in. As she is cleaning the girl up, Ellen spies the devils mark on her. She shows it to Ralph, who recognizes it.The doctor is summoned but refuses to help, saying she bears the devils mark. Ralph and Ellen insist that she be saved. Ralph suggests that the doctor remove the mark. He says he is not equipped to do so and that it will only regrow. Finally he is convinced to operate.Margaret is tied down and the doctor begins cutting. She cries out but is held down. When the skin is removed, the doctor puts it into a bottle. Ralph insists that it be burned. Ellen remarks that there is no blood. The girl confesses her name is Margaret and that she belongs to the devil. She wants to know why her leg hurts.Margaret is seen recovering. Ralph brings her flowers, telling her that she will soon be well enough to walk as well as he. She tells him she will run away to Angel, who is waiting for her. He tells her that Angel is no longer around and that she doesnt serve Angel anymore. She insists to return but Ralph says the Lord will strike her down. She claims her lord is stronger-that he soon will be. She urges Ralph to join them and serve her master, who grows stronger with each sacrifice. He disgustedly refuses her and leaves.The doctor approaches Ralph, asking about Margaret. He replies that she is a hopeless case, talking about her master the devil. The doctor says that the fiend has been seen around, hobbling on one foot. All at once Ellen cries out that Margaret has run away. They begin searching for her. The doctor realizes that the coven will learn that he was the one who removed the skin and will have it in for him. At that moment Peter rides up on his horse and tells him not to worry. Ralph and Ellen come running back, recognizing that Peter has returned. The Judges carriage pulls up and he emerges as they fill him in on what has been happening.Inside, the doctor shows the Judge the skin he removed from Margaret. The Judge takes it for evidence. Outside he reveals trained dogs that will sniff out the devil. They are given the scent of the skin and begin searching.Margaret runs back to Angel with the dogs trailing her. She calls out for Angel to save her. As she approaches she steps into a large trap. Angel comes and asks what she has done. Margaret confesses that the Edmontons have kept her a week at their farm and removed the skin. When Angel sees that the skin is gone, she tells Margaret that she will leave her to the dogs. Margaret continues to struggle to free herself from the trap.The men with the dogs approach, followed by Ralph and the Judge. Ralph tries to free her from the trap. She slaps him, blaming him for her troubles. The Judge asks her name and wants to know who set the trap for her. The Judge says to bring her along.They tie her up in the barn and the Judge questions her about Angel. He tells her that it was Angel who trapped her. She says they meet anywhere that is hidden. Under threat of the dogs attack she admits that tonight they will meet at the old church. The Judge says that is all he needs to know. She tells him he will be too late and that tonight her master will be strong enough to defeat him.Ralph is seen weeding a garden. He accidently cuts his ankle and begins to peel back his sock to observe the wound. He is horrified to see the devils skin underneath. A raven mocks him as Ralph runs away.Returning to the house, Ralph knocks until Ellen opens the door. She asks about his leg but he tells her not to look. She tells him the Judge will take care of everything in the village. He says they may be coming for him and asks if she is alone. She says Peter went to the village. He reveals that he got the skin from Cathy and goes upstairs.The Squire is talking to the villagers about the situation. The Judge is seen approaching in his carriage. He emerges and says that only those resolved to fight this scourge may accompany them. They leave.Ralph looks out from the attic window and sees the villagers carrying torches. He begins to hear approaching footsteps, which grow louder and louder. He realizes the devil is coming for his piece of skin.The mob arrives at the old church site, where a ceremony is going on around a fire. Angel stands in front of Ralph, who has been brought there to give his flesh. She indicates for the ceremony to begin. Coven members march around the fire as one girl (Yvonne Paul) strips and dances before Ralph, giving him a knife. Angel watches from the side. The Judge and men arrive and hide their torches, watching the ceremony. The Judge calls for the large crucifix/scepter to be uncovered which was brought with them. Angel sees it and cries out. She rushes toward it and is stabbed in the darkness. She falls to the ground.The Judge wields the sword toward the other coven members who begin to cower and retreat. The fiend is seen facing the sword and gradually his devilish face is shown in the darkness. The Judge fearlessly continues pressing the sword toward the devil, who finally backs into the fire and collapses. At that moment, the skin is gone from Ralphs foot. They watch as the fiend burns."

The sexually aggressive Jonathan wants to be ""smothered and mothered"" by large breasts, while shy, romantic Sandy claims to value intelligence and sincerity.The film opens at a college party where Jonathan spots Smith College student Susan (Candice Bergman) and, after summarily dismissing her breast size, encourages Sandy to approach her. Sandy's initial clumsy attempt leads to several dates with the intellectual and humorous Susan, which he then reports in detail to Jonathan. After Jonathan pushes him to ""feel her up"", Sandy persists in trying to touch Susan's breasts on a subsequent date, but Susan claims that she is not sexually attracted to him. Desperate, Sandy admits that she is the first girl that he has ever tried to touch in that way. Feeling sorry for Sandy, Susan allows him to touch her while she puts her hand on his penis.After Jonathan learns that Susan is more promiscuous than he had previously thought, he asks Susan to go out with him. While neither Jonathan nor Susan tells Sandy about the resulting romance, Sandy continues to tell about his dates with Susan, claiming that he has fallen in love because she appreciates his sensitivity and intellect.On his next date with Susan, Jonathan, jealous that Susan likes Sandy more than him, tries to win her sympathy by fabricating a story about his humble childhood which led him to want to become a socially conscious lawyer. Several dates later, Jonathan's ploy pays off and Susan agrees to have sex, but does not enjoy the act.

One night, when the three friends go out together, Susan dances with both men, enjoying Jonathan's suave demeanor and easy footwork more than Sandy's awkward attempts at intimacy on the dance floor. Later, Jonathan, angry that Susan has told Sandy that she feels so close to him she can read his thoughts, demands that Susan choose between the two men. When they both agree to break the affair soon after, Susan suggests that they can still be friends, but Jonathan coolly remarks, ""I hope not"". Days later in Sandy and Jonathan's dormitory room, Susan and Sandy playfully argue like a married couple over packing for a camping trip while Jonathan sullenly watches.The film then jumps forward around 10 years later. The two friends meet at an ice skating rink in New York's Central Park and discuss their lives. Jonathan, who is now a taxman, is still the consummate, slightly misogynist playboy and complains the assertive women are gold-digging castrators, and claims that he wants to settle down with someone ""if their figure is good enough"".Sandy, who has married Susan and started a family, is bored with their suburban life and jealous of Jonathan's sexual freedom. Sandy eventually tells Susan that he wants a divorce, and she throws him out of their house.Meanwhile, Jonathan begins dating model Bobbie (Ann-Margaret), whose revealing clothing displays her voluptuous figure. After several weeks of dating and passionate lovemaking with Jonathan, Bobbie suggests they move in together, but Jonathan rejects the proposal, suggesting that it will ruin their sex. Soon after, Jonathan confesses to Sandy that he was experiencing moments of impotence, but has been cured by his attraction to Bobbie's figure. After Bobbie moves in with him, Jonathan insists the she quit her job, promising to provide for her. Bobbie concedes in hopes of marrying Jonathan and having children, but he continues to adamantly resist the idea.At home with nothing to do, Bobbie becomes increasingly depressed, rarely leaving her bed and barely capable of warming television dinners for Jonathan. Lacking in any tenderness, Jonathan constantly berates and humiliates Bobbie, causing her to weep in despair. After Jonathan rages at Bobbie for having a more ""checkered"" sexual past than him and orders her to do something useful like housework, a desperate and sobbing Bobbie states that she cannot stand her life.One night, when Sandy and his new sophisticated girlfriend, Cindy (Cynthia O'Neal), are at Jonathan's apartment to pick them up for a party, Jonathan tells Sandy that Bobbie is too passive, while Sandy claims Cindy dominates him in the bedroom. After Jonathan urges Sandy to swap partners for the night, Sandy agrees and goes to the bedroom to find Bobbie. Jonathan then dances with Cindy, who refuses his advances, confidently explaining that she will sleep with him but only on her terms. When Cindy leaves after ordering Jonathan to tell Sandy that he should not bother returning home if he sleeps with Bobbie, Jonathan opens the bedroom door to find Bobbie passed out from an overdose and Sandy calling an ambulance. Even as he witnesses Bobbie's despair, Jonathan can only yell at the unconscious woman that their relationship is ""not going to work out"".In the present day 1970, more then twenty years since their college days, the now jaded middle-aged friends are still far from understanding love in a committed relationship. Wealthy Jonathan complains about his alimony payments to his now ex-wife Bobbie and their child, while Sandy, desperate to recapture his youth, dates demure 18-year-old Jennifer (Carol Kane), dresses in hippie attire, and espouses the ""free love"" of the new generation. When Sandy and Jennifer visit Jonathan, he presents a slide show of all his lovers, including a picture of Susan which he attempts to ignore, referring to them all as ""frigid ball-busters"", and paints increasingly degrading verbal portraits of each woman, upsetting Sandy and Jennifer.Later, Jonathan confesses to Sandy that he has only glimpsed the illusive nature of love through brief sexual encounters, while Sandy laments that when he finally falls in love with a woman and makes a commitment, his sexual interest in them dies. With his impotence increasing, Jonathan seeks out aging prostitute Louise (Rita Moreno), who obliges Jonathan's obsessive request that she perform a verbal ritual worshiping men's ""virile"" and ""domineering"" behavior and castigating women as manipulative and castrating. When Louise veers slightly from the script, an enraged Jonathan, whose libido has immediately faltered, demands that she repeat the lines verbatim to ensure his satisfaction."

tt0066921,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'SciFi']","""A bit of the old ultra-violence.""The story takes place in London in a dystopian future. ""Our humble narrator"" Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) and his droogs, Georgie (James Marcus), Dim (Warren Clarke), and Pete (Michael Tarn), are seated in the Korova Milk Bar stoned on milk laced with narcotics.Shortly, the gang leaves the Korova for a night of ultra-violence. They encounter a wino (Paul Farrell) in an underpass, and beat him with their truncheons. Later, they arrive at a derelict theater. On the stage, another gang, led by a rival named Billy Boy, prepare to rape a voluptuous girl. Instead, the two gangs battle it out-- Alex and his two droogs are victorious.The trio next head out into the dark countryside looking for action. Alex pilots their stolen Durango 95 sports car. After playing ""hogs of the road,"" wherein they drive on the wrong side of the road and run a number of other motorists off into ditches and over embankments, Alex suggests making a ""surprise visit."" They stop at a lonely country house that displays a backlighted sign that simply reads ""Home."" Alex tricks his way into the house by claiming to be the victim of a car accident. They beat the homeowner, a writer named Frank Alexander (Patrick Magee), and gang rape his wife (Adrienne Corri) while Alex croons ""Singin' in the Rain.""When they've finished having fun, the gang returns to the Korova. An opera singer seated at an adjacent table sings the chorus from Beethoven's 9th Symphony. Listening to the woman, Alex is ecstatic -- ""I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise""-- but Dim ruins the mood when he makes a farting noise. Alex hits him in the crotch with his truncheon. Henceforth, Dim is resentful but Alex dismisses him.Alex arrives at his apartment just before dawn. Climbing into bed, he fantasizes scenes of violence while listening to Beethoven's 9th Symphony.In the morning, Alex's mother (Sheila Raynor) tries to wake Alex for school, but he feigns illness. At the breakfast table she discusses the situation with his father (Philip Stone). Alex's parents seem foolish and impotent. When Alex later awakens and wanders about the apartment in his underwear he encounters his probation officer, Mr. Deltoid (Aubrey Morris), in his parent's bedroom. The officer lectures Alex about his school truancy and threatens him with jail.After Deltoid leaves, Alex begins another busy day. He picks up two girls at a local shopping mall record store and brings them home. In a sped-up sequence backed by the ""William Tell Overture,"" he has sex with both of them.Later that day, he encounters his droogs in his apartment house lobby. They ominously tell him that they've been ""talking."" They feel that Alex has been bullying them, especially Dim, and they suggest that Alex has been taking more than his fair share of the spoils from their robberies. Georgie proposes an idea to make lots more money. He wants to rob a rich lady who owns a health farm in the country. Alex perceives Georgie's independent thinking as a threat, but wanting to appear democratic, he goes along with it. As the three droogs walk along a river bank outside the apartment block, Alex attacks. He throws first Georgie and then Dim into the fountain. When Alex offers to help pull Dim out of the water, he slashes the back of Dim's outstretched hand with a hidden dagger. They all retire to the Duke of York, a restaurant. Having re-established his dominance of the group, Alex reconsiders Georgie's idea.Arriving at the health farm that evening, the droogs try the same trick they'd used at Alexander's house previously: pretending that one of them has been injured in a traffic accident. However, the proprietress (Miriam Karlin) is suspicious and calls the police, telling them that she'd heard the news reports about the writer and his wife being victimized in the same manner. When the boys aren't let into the house, Alex climbs up a drainpipe, enters a second floor window, and confronts the homeowner. They fight, the woman defending herself with a bust of Beethoven, until Alex bludgeons her with a huge plastic phallus sculpture. As police sirens are heard in the distance, Alex runs out the front door. It is there and then that his droogs take their revenge. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a milk bottle and the droogs flee. As Alex writhes and screams on the ground, the police arrive.Alex is arrested. At the police station, an uncooperative and belligerent Alex is questioned by several constables. When an overzealous beat constable presses his thumb against Alex's broken nose, Alex kicks the officer in the groin. The other officers then beat Alex until Deltoid shows up. Deltoid tells Alex that unfortunately for him, the proprietress of the health farm has died, making Alex a murderer. He spits in Alex's face and tells him how disappointed he is. Alex laughs it off, but is soon headed for prison.PrisonAlex gets sentenced to fourteen years in prison. He deposits his possessions with Chief Officer Barnes (Michael Bates), undresses, and undergoes a cavity search. After answering several questions about his health and personal well-being, Alex is given prison garb. He's now prisoner number 655321.Two years later, Alex is shown scheming to get favors by feigning piety. He helps the prison chaplain (Godfrey Quigley) with his service and he studies the Bible. But rather than reflecting on the redemptive power of the Lord, Alex visualizes himself torturing Jesus at the crucifixion, killing people in battle, and laying about with concubines in an Old Testament setting.Alex tells the chaplain that he's heard of a new treatment, the so-called ""Ludovico Technique,"" that helps criminals get out of prison. The chaplain says that it's experimental and that he's not sure it's right for Alex. But Alex, eager to finagle a short-cut to freedom, vies to be selected for the experiment. When the government's Interior Minister (Anthony Sharp) visits the prison, Alex makes a show of himself. The minister picks Alex as a perfect Ludovico subject. Alex is taken before the prison governor (Michael Gover) who tells the boy that, although he'd rather punish him, the political party currently in power have ""new, ridiculous ideas"" about criminal reform, so Alex will shortly be released.The Ludovico TechniqueChief Officer Barnes then transports Alex to the Ludovico Centre. Alex is given a room and is interviewed by Dr. Branom (Madge Ryan). She promises him that he'll be fine, then gives him an injection.In his first day of treatment Alex appears in an auditorium in a straight jacket. His head is strapped to the back of a restraining chair so that he can neither turn his head nor look away. An eye doctor installs clamps on his eyelids that forcibly keep Alex's eyes open. Then, while the doctor constantly drops eye wash into Alex's grotesquely clamped eyes, Alex is subjected to two violent films. The first shows explicit scenes of a severe beating, the second, a gang rape. Halfway through the first film Alex begins to feel sick. By the end of the second, Alex is shouting for something into which to vomit. At the rear of the auditorium, Dr. Brodsky (Carl Duering) explains to observers that the drug administered to Alex causes a form of paralysis with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. Following the screening, Dr. Branom assures Alex that his feeling of sickness is a sign that he's getting better.On the following day Alex is back in the auditorium, this time for two shows: morning and afternoon. While viewing scenes of Nazis during World War II, Alex begins screaming in earnest. The background music is none other than Beethoven's 9th Symphony. Alex screams that he shouldn't be made to feel sick while listening to such beautiful music. Brodsky loudly apologizes, saying that it can't be helped while quietly he speculates to nearby staff that perhaps this is the ""punishment element.""Two weeks later, presumably after twelve more treatments, Alex is paraded before a group of dignitaries by the Interior Minister. Alex is there for demonstration purposes. He is first confronted by an angry Irishman (John Clive) who throws him to the ground and forces Alex to lick his boot. Next he's approached by a statuesque platinum blonde (Virginia Wetherell) clad only in panties. Alex collapses in a fit of nausea when he tries to touch her breasts. The Interior Minister proclaims a new era in law enforcement and social justice, but the prison chaplain exclaims that the procedure has debased Alex's human nature by taking away his ability to choose good over evil. The Interior Minister counter claims that the only thing that matters is results.Welcome HomeAlex returns home to find his parents plus a stranger (Clive Francis) sitting in the living room reading newspaper accounts of his release. Alex tries to make awkward small talk. When he hints about moving back home, his father tells him that Joe, their new lodger, has already paid the next month's rent. Alex is upset but Joe, who has ingratiated himself with Alex's parents, pushes the situation by castigating Alex for the things he did before going to prison and for breaking his parents' hearts. Before Alex can hit Joe, his psychological conditioning kicks in, leaving him dry heaving, to the dismay and disgust of Joe and Alex's parents. When he has recovered, Alex storms out.Alex later stares at the Thames river below a bridge, presumably contemplating suicide. He's approached by a bum seeking spare change. Alex fishes some cash from his pocket and hands it over. Taking a closer look, the bum recognizes Alex as the same malchick who beat him under the bridge two years earlier. Alex looks at the bum in horror and tries to escape, but is trapped in the very same underpass by the bum and his elderly compatriots. They hit and kick Alex as he cowers on the ground, disabled by his conditioning. Two constables show up to break up the fight. To Alex's further horror, his rescuers turn out to be Dim and Georgie, his former droogs, who are now constables. Demonstrating that police training hasn't altered their basic violent natures, they handcuff Alex, drive him out of town. Out in the woods, Dim pushes Alex' head into a cattle trough filled with filthy water, and Georgie beats him with his baton. They then remove the cuffs and leave him battered and gasping. With thoughts of home echoing in his head, Alex staggers to the first house he can find. It displays a welcoming, backlighted sign that reads ""Home.""At home, Frank Alexander sits at his typewriter, now in the wheelchair that he's used ever since he was severely beaten two years earlier. Julian (David Prowse), his muscular attendant, answers the doorbell. As Julian opens the door, Alex collapses into the entryway. Julian carries him into the house.When confronted by a concerned Mr. Alexander, Alex realizes he's at the very same residence in which, two years earlier, he and his former partners in crime gang-raped Alexander's wife. He relaxes, however, when he realizes that Mr. Alexander couldn't possibly recognize him due to the fact that Alex and his droogies wore masks back in those days. Mr. Alexander, who knows Alex only as the subject of the Ludovico treatment, invites the lad to have a bath and some supper.As Alex soaks in the bath, Mr. Alexander calls a friend with whom he discusses the political repercussions of Alex's Ludovico conditioning. He believes that the government has a totalitarian agenda, as exemplified by its willingness to rob its citizens of their free will. As he finishes the conversation, Alexander arranges a visit with the person on the other end, stating, ""He'll be here,"" before he hangs up the phone.Mr. Alexander sits in his wheelchair relishing a fantasy of using Alex as a political pawn when he becomes aware of singing coming from the bathroom. In his bath, Alex has struck up a bright rendition of ""Singin' in the Rain."" Mr. Alexander's face twists in agony and rage as he thinks back to the night of the home invasion that left him crippled and realizes just who Alex is.Later, at the dinner table, an obviously distraught Mr. Alexander encourages Alex to eat and drink. Flanked by the apoplectic Mr. Alexander and the burly Julian, Alex eats a plate of spaghetti while Mr. Alexander plies Alex with red wine. As he eats, Alex grows increasingly fearful, wondering if the hostile-looking old man knows his real identity. Suddenly Mr. Alexander brings up the subject of his wife's rape and subsequent death. He believes that, though she officially died of pneumonia, it was her broken spirit that killed her. She was, according to Mr. Alexander, a victim of the modern age, just as Alex is a victim of the modern age. He tells Alex that two friends are expected and that they will help the boy.A minute later, man named Dolin (John Savident) and a woman (Margaret Tyzack) enter. They question Alex about the Ludovico treatment and whether it is true that, in addition to conditioning him against sex and violence, it has also made him incapable of listening to music. Alex replies that he only feels a foreboding sense of extreme depression when he hears Beethoven's Ninth Symphony specifically-- at which point he passes out, face down, into the plate of spaghetti. He has been drugged by the wine. Dolin congratulates Mr. Alexander who then asks Julian to bring the car around to the front. The conspirators have plans for Alex that will embarrass the government.Alex awakens the next morning in a small, second floor bedroom in an unknown country house. The room is flooded with the strains of Beethoven's 9th Symphony blasted from a stereo in the room below. As Mr. Alexander beams with satisfaction, Alex is driven to suicide. He leaps from the second floor window to the stone patio below.CuredSome time later, Alex wakes up in a hospital in a full-body cast, having survived his suicide attempt. Newspaper clippings reveal that the government is being vilified for inhuman experimentation. The Interior Minister is being subjected to especially fierce attack. Alex's parents visit, apologizing for not taking him back and promising him his old room when he is released from the hospital.Next, Alex is visited by Doctor Taylor (Pauline Taylor), a psychiatrist. He tells her he had strange dreams of other scientists messing around in his head. She says she's unable to interpret his dreams and then cheerfully shows Alex a series of cartoons having sexual or violent connotations. Alex is to supply the captions. He pleases Dr. Taylor by indicating through his descriptions of the cartoons that sex and violence are the foremost interests on his mind.Once the Ludovico Treatment has been successfully reversed, the Interior Minister visits Alex. As the aristocratic Minister spoon-feeds dinner to the juvenile thug, he assures Alex that he wants to be his friend. With oily smoothness the Minister apologizes for what his government has done. He promises Alex a good job on a good salary, provided that Alex helps the government. He assures the lad that the subversive writer, Frank Alexander, who had threatened him, has been put away. Alex milks the meeting for all it's worth.As a symbol of their understanding, the Minister calls for his assistants. They sweep in with flowers and a massive stereo system blasting Beethoven's 9th Symphony, followed by a troop of reporters and photographers. Alex poses with his new friend, the Interior Minister, aka ""Fred,"" as cameras flash and Beethoven's 9th Symphony reaches its choral climax. Alex's eyes roll back into his head as he fantasizes about an orgy in the snow with a gorgeous blonde, to the applause of Victorian ladies and gentlemen.Alex is heard in voiceover: ""I was cured, all right."""
tt0066947,"['Drama', 'History']","A documentary reenactment of the government-ordered massacre of striking tin miners and their families at the Siglo XX Mines in 1967 in Bolivia.The film starts with previous massacres and represions (starting 1942 in Catavi), before and after the bolivian Revolution, and puts the finger on the people responsible. All of this according to the director's belief of movies having to show what people wanted: and people wanted to know causes and responsibilities. A little reading on the history of Bolivia after the revolution should led to a better understanding of this film, for it was directed to people who actually lived the process (some of them acting in the movie), and many meaningful sequences and details may not be understood in all their symbolic and historic value."
tt0066993,"['Biography', 'Drama', 'History']","In 17th Century France, Cardinal Richelieu (Christopher Logue) is influencing King Louis XIII (Graham Armitage) in an attempt to gain further power. He convinces Louis that the fortifications of cities throughout France should be demolished to prevent Protestants from uprising. Louis agrees, but forbids Richelieu from carrying out demolitions in the town of Loudun, having made a promise to its governor not to damage the town.Meanwhile in Loudun, the Governor has died, leaving control of the city to Urbain Grandier (Oliver Reed), a dissolute and proud but popular and well-regarded Catholic priest. He is having an affair with a relative of Father Canon Mignon (Murray Melvin), another priest in the town, unaware that the deformed, neurotic Sister Jeanne (Vanessa Redgrave), head of the local convent, is sexually obsessed with him. She asks for Grandier to become the convent's new confessor. Grandier secretly marries another woman, Madeline De Brou (Gemma Jones), but news of this reaches Sister Jeanne, driving her to insanity (this includes an attack where Sister Jeanne viciously attacks Madeleine when the latter brings back a book that the former had lent her, and Sister Jeanne accuses Madeleine of being a ""fornicator"" and ""sacrilegious bitch"", among other things).Baron de Laubardemont (Dudley Sutton) arrives with orders to demolish the city, overriding Grandier's orders to stop. Grandier summons the town's soldiers and forces Laubardemont to back down pending the arrival of an order for the demolition from King Louis. Grandier departs Loudun to visit the King. In the meantime, Sister Jeanne is informed by Father Mignon that he is to be her new confessor. She informs him of Grandier's marriage and affairs, and also inadvertently accuses Grandier of witchcraft and of possessing her. Mignon relays this information to Laubardemont. In the process, the information is boiled down to just the claim that Grandier has bewitched the convent and has had commerce with the Devil. With Grandier away from Loudon, Laubardemont and Mignon decide to find evidence against him.Laubardemont summons the lunatic inquisitor Father Pierre Barre (Michael Gothard), a ""professional witch-hunter"", whose interrogations actually involve depraved acts of ""exorcism"", including the forced administration of enemas to his victims. Sister Jeanne claims that Grandier has bewitched her, and the other nuns do the same. A public exorcism erupts in the town, in which all of the nuns remove their clothes and enter a state of religious frenzy. Duke Henri de Condé (actually king Louis in disguise) arrives, claiming to be carrying a holy relic which can remove the ""devils"" possessing the nuns. Father Barre ""exorcises"" the nuns with it. They appear as though they have been cured until Condé/Louis reveals the case allegedly containing the relic to be empty. Despite this proof that the possessions and the exorcisms are a sham, both continue unabated, eventually descending into a massed orgy in which the nuns sexually assault and desecrate a statue of Christ.In the midst of the chaos, Grandier and his wife return and are immediately arrested. After being given a ridiculous show trial, Grandier is shaven and tortured although at his execution he eventually manages to convince Mignon that he is innocent. The judges, clearly under orders from Laubardemont, sentence Grandier to death by burning at the stake. Laubardemont has also obtained permission to destroy the city's fortifications. Despite pressure on Grandier to confess to the trumped-up charges, he refuses. He is then taken to be burnt at the stake. His executioner promises to strangle him rather than let him suffer the agonising death by fire that he would otherwise experience. However, the overzealous Barre starts the fire himself, and Mignon, now visibly panic-stricken about the possibility of Grandier's innocence, pulls the noose tight before it can be used to strangle the priest. As Grandier burns, Laubardemont gives the order for explosive charges to be set off and the city walls are blown up, causing the people to flee.After the execution, Barre leaves Loudun to continue his witch-hunting activities elsewhere in the southwest of France. Laubardemont informs Sister Jeanne that Mignon has been put away in an asylum for claiming that Grandier was innocent (the explanation given is that he is demented), and that ""with no signed confession to prove otherwise, everyone has the same opinion"". He gives her one of Grandier's charred bones and leaves. Sister Jeanne, now completely broken, masturbates pathetically with the charred femur. Grandier's wife, having been released is seen walking away from the ruined city as the film ends."

After interrogating several of Blofeld's associates worldwide, Bond traces him to a facility where he is surgically creating lookalikes of himself. Bond kills a test subject who is lying in a mud bath. The man raises a pistol but Bond releases more mud, drowning the man. Blofeld walks in, pointing a pistol. After a fight, Bond kills Blofeld by throwing him into another mud pool.In a South African desert, two men, Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith), are observing a scorpion and talking about how deadly they are. Wint dons gloves and picks up the scorpion. A man arrives on a scooter; he is a dentist who smuggles diamonds from South African mines, retrieving them from his patients who hide them in their mouths. He has come to give Wint and Kidd a small load of them. Kidd begins moaning in pain, claiming he has a toothache. The doctor begins to examine him when Wint drops the live scorpion into his shirt, killing him. A helicopter arrives, the pilot demanding to know where the doctor is. Kidd and Wint tell the man that the doctor is ill and couldn't make it. They give the man a case, presumably containing the diamonds. As the chopper flies off, it explodes. Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd then walk off, hand-in-hand, with the diamonds.Suspecting that South African diamonds are being stockpiled to depress prices by dumping and convinced that Blofeld is dead, M (Bernard Lee) orders Bond to go undercover as smuggler Peter Franks, whom has been arrested and detained and unveil the smuggling ring. Meanwhile, Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd arrive in Amsterdam and systematically kill more diamond smugglers involved in the ring. Posing as Franks, Bond travels to Amsterdam to meet his contact, a shrewd American woman named Tiffany Case (Jill St. John), at her apartment where he is to pick up the diamonds. However, the real Franks has escaped custody and shows up later that evening and tries to contact Case. Bond intercepts and kills him and sabotages the attack to make it seem like Franks is actually James Bond. Case and Bond smuggle the diamonds to Los Angeles hiding them inside Franks' corpse. They are unaware that Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd are also on the same flight to Los Angeles.At the LA airport, Bond meets his CIA ally Felix Leiter (Norman Burton) and transports the body to Slumber Inc., a funeral home which is a smuggling front where Bond meets the lead undertaker Rodney (Marc Lawrence) and his assistant (Sid Haig) where the dead body of Franks is cremated and the diamonds passed onto the next smuggler, an elderly man named Shady Tree. While Bond retrieves the cash for the diamonds, he's knocked unconscious by Wint and Kidd, who put him in a coffin and trundle it into the cremation oven. Bond nearly burns alive when the coffin is suddenly opened by Tree and Mr. Slumber. Tree accuses Bond of giving them fake diamonds and Bond counters saying that they wouldn't have tried to burn him alive with the real money. Bond tells Leiter to ship the real diamonds while he relaxes at a Las Vegas hotel and casino called The Whyte House, where Tree works as a stand-up comedian. Bond discovers Tree has been killed by Wint and Kidd in his dressing room, who did not know that the diamonds were fake. When the casino pit boss, Mr. Saxby, and the underboss to Wint and Kidd, realizes that Tree did not have the real diamonds, he contacts his superior for further instructions.Later in the casino, Bond meets an opportunistic woman named Plenty O' Toole (Lana Wood). She cheers him on as he gambles, and, (in a deleted scene), they have dinner together. She invites herself up to his room, but after Bond undresses Plenty she is grabbed and thrown out of a window, landing in the hotel pool, by the Slumber Inc. thugs already waiting in his room, who have now come for the real diamonds. The thugs then leave Bond to spend the rest of the night with Tiffany Case whom is in the bedroom waiting for him. (In another deleted scene, Plenty returns to Bond's room to retrieve her clothes. She sees Bond and Tiffany in bed together, and takes an address card from Tiffany's purse, later to show up at Tiffany's house.)Tiffany tries to get Bond to reveal the location of the real diamonds by offering to help him steal the diamonds for themselves. Bond pretends to give in and arranges for her to retrieve the diamonds at the Circus Circus Las Vegas casino. At the circus, Tiffany picks up the diamonds in a stuffed toy puppy, unaware that she is under the surveillance of Felix Leiter and his men, but she reneges her deal with Bond and flees, shipping off the diamonds to the next smuggler. When Tiffany returns to her operation residence she finds Bond waiting for her and finds the body of Plenty, who was killed (presumably by Wint and Kidd) when she was mistaken for Tiffany. Having survived the attempt on her life, the initially reticent Tiffany tells Bond where the diamonds are.Bond and Tiffany go to the Las Vegas airport to watch the small locker where Tiffany was instructed to leave the stuffed puppy containing the diamonds. The toy is picked up by a porter who takes it to the casino pit boss, Saxby, who then drives it in a van to a local filling station where he switches with another man who gets in the van. Tiffany distracts the other driver of the van long enough for Bond to sneak in to follow the location of the diamonds. The van is driven outside of the city to a government laboratory in the desert.Posing as a lab worker, Bond enters the apparent destination of the diamonds; a research laboratory owned by reclusive Las Vegas millionaire Willard Whyte (Jimmy Dean), where he finds the driver of the van is laser refraction specialist Professor Dr. Metz (Joseph Fürst) constructing a satellite. He notices a cassette tape in a case marked ""World's Greatest Marches"", which Metz possessively takes back from him. When his cover is blown, Bond escapes from the lab by stealing a moon buggy and reunites with Tiffany. They return to the Vegas that evening where they get into another wild car chase with the local police on Vegas' famous Freemont Street and evade all their police pursuers.Bond and Case check into a suite in the Whyte House where Felix and his men place Tiffany under house arrest after Bond finally reveals his real identity to her. Bond later scales the walls to the top floor of the Whyte House to confront Willard Whyte. Inside, 007 is confronted by two identical Blofelds who are posing as Whyte using an adapted telephone to mask their voice. (The Blofeld Bond killed in the pre-title teaser was another imposter.) Not knowing which to kill, Bond kicks Blofeld's white Persian cat into the arms of one of the pair and shoots him. However, Bond again chose the wrong man, killing another imposter. Blofeld refuses to reveal any of his plan to Bond and orders him into an elevator where he is sprayed with gas and knocked out.Bond is taken by Wint and Kidd to be buried underground in the desert in a new sewer line. He escapes and contacts Blofeld, posing as Bert Saxby. He finds out Whyte's location and, after a brief battle with his female bodyguards Bambi and Thumper, rescues Whyte, but in the meantime Blofeld escapes from the Whyte House and abducts Tiffany. With the help of Whyte and Felix, Bond returns to the government lab and uncovers Blofeld's plot to create a laser satellite using the diamonds, which is now already in orbit. Blofeld destroys nuclear installations in the United States and China, a Russian nuclear submarine in the Pacific and then proposes an international auction for global nuclear supremacy.Looking over Whyte's map of his business empire, Bond identifies an oil rig off the coast of Baja California as Blofeld's base of operations. Arriving at the rig, he is immediately apprehended. Bond had planned to switch the cassette containing the codes which control the satellite with a music tape. After he does, he gives the coded one to Tiffany who is living there as a hostage. However, trying to be helpful, she re-switches the tapes, then gets caught trying to fix her mistake and is sent down to the brig. At this point, Felix Leiter and the CIA have already begun a heavy attack on the oil-rig aboard a fleet of helicopters. Tiffany manages to escape amidst the chaos and regroup with Bond. Blofeld tries to escape on a mini-sub, but Bond gains control of the crane used to lower it and crashes the sub into the control room, defeating Blofeld and destroying the satellite control along with the rest of the base.Bond and Tiffany then head for home on a P&O ship Canberra, but they are unaware that Wint and Kidd also aboard. That evening, disguised as waiters, Wint and Kidd enter Bond and Tiffany's stateroom to serve them dinner and leave them with a bomb hidden in a cake timed to go off in three minutes. Despite having never seen them face-to-face, Bond sees through their ploy when he recognizes the scent of Wint's aftershave. When Bond blows Wint's cover by tricking him into revealing his poor knowledge of wines, a fight breaks out, and Bond disposes of both of them; Kidd is set on fire and jumps over the side into the sea and Wint has the bomb tied to him after Bond discovers it. Bond flips him overboard seconds before the bomb explodes. The film ends with Tiffany asking Bond how can they get all the diamonds in the orbiting laser satellite back down to Earth again which now appears as a bright spot in the night sky."

He demands $100,000 to stop his killing spree, or he ""will target either a catholic priest, or a nigger"". The mayor discusses his options with the police chief, and Callahan's superior, Lt. Al Bressler.The mayor calls Harry in, and immediately asks what he's been doing. Harry angrily responds that he's been sitting on his ass in the mayor's office, then lays out the plan of investigation so far. Lt. Bressler announces that he's arranged for helicopter surveillance in probable target areas. To Harry's disbelief, the mayor agrees to lead Scorpio on for the time being, to post a message in the newspaper (per Scorpio's instructions) as if they plan to pay him. Before leaving, the Mayor tells Harry that he doesn't want the same kind of trouble that Harry's caused in the past. Harry responds that he was trying to stop a rape, and, again with sarcasm, shoots down the Mayor.Across from a bank, Harry sits down for a hot dog lunch. He asks the cook behind the counter if the car across the street, in front of the bank, is still running. The cook says it is, and Harry tells him to call the police - there is an armed robbery in progress at that bank. No sooner does he say this than the banks alarms go off and gunfire erupts. Harry takes a bite of his hot dog, swears, and then heads out to face the robbers. He orders one man to freeze, and the man shoots at Harry with a shotgun, who returns fire. The men in the car speed toward Harry, but he shoots into the windshield, causing them to crash into a fire hydrant and flip the car over. One man jumps out and shoots at Harry, who shoots back and kills him. He looks down at his leg, shot and bleeding from buckshot, but he seems unaffected... still chewing on his hot dog.Harry strolls through the spraying water of the fire hydrant, to the wounded man by the entrance of the bank. The man's hand moves slowly toward his dropped shotgun, and Harry points his revolver at him and makes his famous ""six-shots-or-only-five"" speech with a hit of sarcasm in his voice: ""I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots, or only five? Now, to tell you the truth, I forgot myself in all this excitement. But this here is a .44 Magnum Revolver, the most powerful handgun in the world and it'll blow your head clean off. You've gotta ask yourself one question: do I feel lucky? Well... do you, punk?""The man cowers and surrenders. Harry picks up the shotgun, and the robber stops him. ""Hey I gots to know."" he asks. Harry raises his .44 Magnum and pulls the trigger and smiles. Harry fooled the wounded robber into giving up. The gun is empty.In the hospital, Harry has his wounded leg looked at by a doctor. During the process of treatment, the doctor tells Harry to have his wife to help treat his wound, but stops himself mid-sentence and apologizes.In the air, a police helicopter is making the rounds over the city.The next day, Harry walks through the department and meets with the captain, who congratulates Harry on stopping the robbery. The captain announces that he's saddling Harry with a new partner, and introduces Chico Gonzales. Harry gripes about not wanting a partner, and that his partners always wind up in the hospital, or dead. But the captain is unmoved and tells Harry that he doesn't have a choice.Harry and Chico walk and talk for a while, before stopping to talk with another cop, DiGiorgio. Chico warily asks how Harry got his nickname Dirty Harry. DiGiorgio fills him in, explaining that Harry is an equal opportunity bigot, hating every ethnicity equally. Chico asks how he feels about Mexicans, and Harry responds that he hates them especially.Somewhere in the city, Scorpio is on another rooftop, across from a church, reading the personal ad that contains the city's response to his ransom. Unhappy with the ""be patient"" message, he tears up the paper, and walks to the roof's ledge. He opens his rifle case and begins spying down on the neighborhood through his scope. He sees a black man walking on the street and places the cross hairs on him. Scorpio follows him for a while, and then hastily puts his rifle together. Before he can take his shot, though, the police chopper spots him and he is forced to retreat.That night, Harry and Chico are riding through the city, complaining about how the chopper cops lost Scorpio. Over the radio, they hear a description of the sniper, and Chico immediately spots a man fitting the description and carrying a tan suitcase. They turn around to follow him, but eventually split up, with Harry inconspicuously pursuing him on foot.Harry walks down an alley and spies the man walking into an apartment. He climbs up on a trashcan and looks into the apartment window. The man's suitcase is only holding lingerie for his girlfriend, Hot Mary, who is walking around the apartment topless. Harry realizes this is not Scorpio, but is suddenly attacked from behind by a couple of men who thought he was a peeping tom. They smack Harry around a bit, before Chico stops them. Harry tells him to let the guys go, though, and Chico jokes about why the other officers call him Dirty Harry.Back in the car, Harry and Chico get a call from an officer who spots a man on a roof, and they take off in that direction. It turns out the man is not Scorpio, but instead, he's a suicidal jumper. Without much hesitation, Harry climbs into a crane bucket and rides up to the roof, to confront the man. The jumper immediately tells Harry to stay away, and Harry tells the man he's going to keep his distance: jumpers sometimes decide to take someone with them when they die. A grotesque story follows, about a fellow officer who was killed like that. Harry includes all the gory details causing the man to become sick. Angered, he attempts to grab at Harry, but Harry's quicker and punches him out, cuffs him to the rails on the crane bucket and brings him down. On the street, Harry tells Chico he got his nickname by taking ""any dirty job that comes along"".The next day, Harry and Chico are called to the site of a dead body: a young black kid is found shot in the head. As Harry and Chico are looking over the crime scene, the boy's mother tells them her son was only ten years old. Another officer finds a shell casing that confirms the boy was killed by Scorpio.Harry has a meeting with the chief, and they discuss the plan to capture Scorpio. They will post highly-visible policemen all over the city at high probability targets, but no policemen near the site where the chopper had spotted him the day before. Harry and Chico will stake out the area, armed and ready to take Scorpio down if he appears. Chico expresses his doubts that Scorpio will target the same area twice, but Harry explains that he believes the sniper will want to take out a priest now.That night, the two detectives are watching over the church. Harry tells Chico that the priest of the church volunteered to be bait for the murderer. With binoculars, Harry spies on the entire neighborhood, including a nude woman and her two male companions. As he's watching the party, he notices that one of the nearby roof doors is now open. Harry and Chico prepare to throw the spotlight on Scorpio, and Harry takes aim with his rifle. He fires, but misses. Scorpio fires on them with a machine gun but misses, destroying the lights. He laughs gleefully as he fires.Harry and Chico rush downstairs, and across the street, where DiGiorgio kneels over the body of an officer that Scorpio apparently killed in his escape.The next day, their captain tells Harry and Chico that Scorpio has kidnapped a 14-year-old girl, Ann Mary Deacon. His ransom note says that he's buried her alive, and has raised his ransom to $200,000, demanding it by 9pm. He threatens to let the girl suffocate to death if he's not paid. Harry insists that the girl is probably already dead, but Lt. Bressler tells him that the mayor has agreed to pay. He asks Harry to drop the money off, and tells Chico he's not allowed to help.Chico responds, 'No wonder they call him Dirty Harry. Always gets the shit-end of the stick.'Harry prepares for the drop by getting a microphone to put under his shirt, so that Chico can furtively follow him. Harry gets the money from the mayor's office. While the captain tells Harry that Scorpio will probably run Harry all over town before he drops the money, Harry tapes a switchblade to his ankle. The captain tells Harry to play it straight and not to try anything funny.Harry arrives at the marina, the designated drop point, and answers a nearby payphone. Scorpio tells him he's going to give Harry a little exercise and intends to have him travel all over the city on foot to make sure he's not being followed. Hidden nearby in his car, Chico listens in. Scorpio instructs Harry to run to a nearby railroad station.He makes it and answers the Scorpio's call. Harry next has to make a train that is leaving the station immediately. Barely making it, he jumps on and rides to the next checkpoint. Chico continues to follow. Harry answers the next call, and Scorpio laughs as he tells Harry that he's going to have a long run now.While running, Harry is accosted by three thugs who try to take the money bag. It's a short delay, but Harry can't afford it, and he quickly beats the three goons down. He sprints to the phone, but a man answers it before Harry can. Scorpio hangs up, but calls back immediately, giving Harry instructions to run to Mission Davis Park and meet him there at the foot of the cross. Chico follows but keeps a safe distance.Harry walks through the park, taking a look at everyone he passes. A young man that Harry thinks may be Scorpio turns out to be a male hustler, so Harry runs him off. He makes it to the top of the hill in Mission Davis Park, at the foot of the large stone cross. Scorpio shows up wearing a ski mask. Scorpio disarms Harry and starts to beat him. He tells Harry that he changed his mind and has decided to let the girl die, and now he's going to kill Harry, too. Before he can, though, Chico shoots at him, but misses. Scorpio and Chico exchange fire, and Chico is hit in the chest. Harry pulls the switchblade from his leg and plunges it deep into Scorpio's leg. Scorpio screams and limps off. Harry tries to shoot at Scorpio, but misses and then passes out from the beating. Scorpio makes it to a hospital.In his office, the hot-headed Bressler is talking to the chief on the phone; the chief is not happy that Harry and Chico disobeyed orders. Harry tells Bressler he'll quit when this is over, if that's what the chief wants. They get a call from a doctor at an emergency room: the doctor reports treating a man with a stab wound in the leg.Harry and DiGiorgio talk to the doctor who isn't very helpful at first. But he does remember that he had seen the man before. After a few moments he remembers that the man works as a groundskeeper at a nearby stadium. Harry and DiGiorgio climb the fence outside the stadium, and inspect the grounds in the dark. Scorpio spies on them and eventually takes off running. Harry chases him while DiGiorgio looks for a way to turn on the lights. Scorpio is running/limping across the football field, when Harry finally catches up to him, and DiGiorgio hits the floodlights.Harry has his gun on Scorpio and fires, hitting him in the leg. Scorpio sobs for help and Harry demands to know where the girl is. Scorpio yells that Harry tried to kill him, but Harry replies: ""If I was trying to kill you, your head would be splattered all over this field!"". Harry again demands to know where the girl is. The psychopathic Scorpio yells that he has rights and he wants a lawyer, but Harry angrily grinds his foot into the wound, as the scene pulls up and away from the two men in Kezar Stadium.At dawn, Harry stands on a hilltop overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. Behind him, officers are pulling the dead body of Ann Mary Deacon out of the ground.Harry is called to a meeting with William Rothko, the Assistant District Attorney. He is shocked and disgusted that the DA is going to release Scorpio, because Harry's search of the killer's home was illegal (the issue of probable cause is never brought up) and the rifle that is the murder weapon is inadmissible as evidence. Bannerman, a local by-the-book judge, backs up Rothko's claim, and the D.A. condescendingly chastises Harry about the suspect's rights. Harry fumes and wants to know about the rights of the victims, but the arrogant and unfeeling D.A. does not care. ""That's the law"", he says, and Harry retorts: ""Then the law is crazy!""As he's leaving, Harry says that as soon as Scorpio slips up, Harry will be there to arrest him. The D.A. warns that he won't stand for harassment. Harry says that Scorpio is a sociopath con artist and he will not stop his killing spree, as ""he likes it too much"".Scorpio walks into a park in the middle of the day, and immediately notices Callahan following him. Sitting in a stag bar, he sees Harry watching him. The next day, Scorpio meets with a tough looking black guy in a run-down factory. The other man makes sure Scorpio wasn't followed and then leads him to a back room, where he takes payment from Scorpio: $200 for the man to beat Scorpio to a pulp. He sits him in a chair and then begins punching him in the face. He lands several heavy blows, but eventually grows dubious and stops. Scorpio taunts him with racist remarks and the black man kicks him in the face. Realizing that his victim is insane, he kicks Scorpio out.The next scene shows him being wheeled down the hall of a hospital, enthusiastically talking to reporters and blaming the San Francisco police for his beating. He falsely singles out Harry as the main culprit. The chief meets with Harry, but Harry says he looks ""too damn good"" to have caught a beating from Harry himself. The chief orders Harry to stop tailing Scorpio. Harry leaves with a scoff.Harry visits Chico at the hospital, where he is sitting outside with his wife. Chico tells Harry that he's not coming back to the department. He is going to be a teacher instead. Chico is wheeled off to physical therapy, leaving Harry and Mrs. Gonzalez to chat for a while. They walk out of the hospital, and Chico's wife tells Harry that she feels responsible for his leaving. She tells him that she got nervous every time Chico left, and asks Harry if his wife felt the same. Harry says no. He tells her that his wife died in a drunk-driving accident some years ago. Harry tells Chico's wife that he understands why Chico is leaving the police force. When she asks him why he stays in the job, Harry says, ""I don't know. I really don't"".Later that night, the killer Scorpio enters a liquor store and chats with the shopkeeper. To explain his beaten face, he makes up a lie about hitting his wife and being beaten by her brother. He asks the owner about his being robbed before, and the owner admits to shooting and killing the last two robbers. He brags and shows off his pistol to show Scorpio. Scorpio instantly smashes a bottle over the shopkeeper's head and takes the gun.The next scene shows a school bus dropping children off at the end of the school day. Scorpio climbs into the bus pretending to be a school bus inspector. When the driver tries to stop him, Scorpio pulls the gun on her. He tells her to start driving, he'll direct her. He then turns his attention to the kids, making them sing.At city hall, Harry's captain watches as Harry arrives. As he and the captain walk up to the mayor's office, they discuss a new note from Scorpio. They enter the mayor's office, while the mayor is preparing a jet for the killer. The mayor then takes a call from Scorpio, who informs them of the bus hostage situation. He forces the bus driver to confirm. He demands his jet and $200,000, and tells mayor he intends to take the bus to the airport. The mayor foolishly tells Scorpio that he won't be harmed. The chief asks Harry to take the money, but when they order him to just make the drop without trying to stop Scorpio, he refuses, telling the arrogant mayor, ""Go find yourselves another delivery boy"".Back on the bus, Scorpio has the children maniacally singing ""Row, row, row your boat"", but eventually the children become whiny, wanting to get home. Scorpio quickly loses patience, slapping one boy, and scaring the children even more. He gives the bus driver more directions, and has her exit the highway. They are headed for an underpass, and Scorpio panics when he sees Harry standing on top of the bridge, waiting for him. Harry jumps on the roof of the moving bus, and Scorpio starts shooting up at him, causing the bus driver to faint. Scorpio takes the wheel, and swerves the bus all over the road, trying to throw Harry off.He crashes the bus through a fence, sending Harry flying into a mound of sand. Scorpio jumps out of the back emergency exit and flees to a nearby mill. Harry chases him. While running, they exchange gunfire, and once again, we lose track of how many shots Harry has fired. Harry is gaining on Scorpio, so he tries to ambush him, but Harry ducks and Scorpio misses. Scorpio runs out the back of the mill, and to a small dock, where a young boy is fishing.With Harry not far behind him, Scorpio (ruthless to the last) grabs the boy and puts the gun to his head, yelling at Harry to drop his gun. Harry drops his arm to his side, but quickly brings it back up and shoots Scorpio in the shoulder, knocking him backwards. The boy escapes and quickly runs away.Scorpio tries to reach for his gun, but Harry stops him and points his revolver at the killer. He repeats his speech from earlier, but his wry grin is gone this time, replaced with dead-serious fury.""I know what you're thinking, punk! You're thinking, did he fire six shots, or only five?! Now, to tell you the truth, I forgot myself in all this excitement. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world and it'll blow your head clean off! You've gotta ask yourself a question! Do I feel lucky? Well, do you, punk?!""Scorpio thinks for a moment, then giggles madly and reaches for his pistol. Harry fires, shooting Scorpio in the chest. The psychopathic killer falls into the water and floats there, dead. Scorpio had unwisely called Harry's bluff - and paid for it with his life.Sirens wail in the distance. Harry takes out his badge. He pulls his gold star out of the leather fold and looks at it for a moment before throwing it into the water. The camera pans away from Harry as he walks away and the credits roll."
tt0067065,"['Action', 'SciFi']","The preceding film, 'Beneath the Planet of the Apes', ends with a nuclear weapon's destruction of the apes' future Earth itself and everything on it.'Escape from the Planet of the Apes' begins by establishing that three chimpanzee apes, Cornelius (Roddy McDowall), Zira (Kim Hunter), and Dr. Milo (Sal Mineo) escaped the Earth's destruction by salvaging and repairing the astronaut Taylor's spaceship (which sank in the Dead Lake in the desert Forbidden Zone in the first movie) and piloting it through the nuclear shock wave of Earth's destruction, sending the ship into space and through a time warp wormhole back to present day 1973. The salvage, repair and launch of Taylor's spaceship apparently all happened (off-camera) within the brief period during the final act of the previous film.The three apes arrive on Earth, splashing down on the Pacific coast near Los Angeles. They are found by the surprised local authorities and are transported to a secluded area of the Los Angeles Zoo, under the observation of two scientists, Stephanie Branton (Natalie Trundy) and Lewis Dixon (Bradford Dillman), who administer a series of intelligence tests, which Zira performs unerringly, but she finally loses her patience at the end of the last one and answers Stephanie's question to Lewis with an angry retort. Stephanie and Lewis step outside, completely astonished. Milo argues with Zira and Cornelius about their agreement to hide their ability to speak until they felt the time was right. The argument agitates a wild gorilla on the opposite side of a set of bars in the cages. Milo steps too close to these bars and the wild gorilla reaches through them and strangles Milo to death.Meanwhile, a Presidential Commission has been formed to investigate the return of Taylor's spaceship which was launched the previous year and how the apes, which they already are aware are atypically intelligent, came to be aboard it. Cornelius and Zira are brought before the Presidential Commission, where they publicly reveal their ability to speak, and are welcomed as guests. They tell the commission about their planet in the future which is future Earth, about the apes way of life, but they deny knowing Taylor or anyone else that crash landed on their world.Over the next several weeks, the two apes become celebrities, being lavished with presents and media attention as well as staying in a fancy hotel suite. They come to the attention of the President's Science Advisor Dr. Otto Hasslein (Eric Braeden), who discovers Zira is pregnant and fears for the future of the human race after Zira had earlier told the commission about the growing dominance of apes to be set in the near future. Determined to force the issue, he gets her drunk on champagne (which he assures her is harmless, calling it ""grape juice plus""). The resulting interrogation enables him to convince the Commission that Cornelius and Zira must be subjected to more rigorous questioning.Both chimpanzees are brought to a top secret military base are questioned using various means of interrogation; during this time, one of Hasslein's assistants refers to the apes as ""monkeys"", stirring Cornelius' anger. Hasslein defuses it, saying they simply want to know how apes rose in dominance over men. Under interrogation, Cornelius reveals that according to the historic archive books and sacred scrolls in their ape society of the future, the human race will eventually meet its downfall in the late 20th Century after a plague wiped out all domestic cats and dogs of humans and that humanity adopted apes as household pets which they turned into slaves and that a militant ape, known only as 'Aldo', led a slave revolt and the world was soon dominated by the simians, which will, many years later, lead to the surface of Earth's destruction through nuclear war and anarchy. So many centuries later, in the year 3955, the apes have established a stable and peace full society of semi-primitive nature. However, there are still suspicions about how humans are treated by the future apes when Cornelius and Zira continue to deny knowing Taylor or talk about how humans are treated in their world.Suspicion had already been aroused by Zira letting it slip, during her drunken interrogation by Dr. Hasslein, that she had dissected humans in the course of her scientific work. Hasslein orders Lewis to administer a truth serum to her, while Cornelius is taken to confinement quarters. Lewis warns Zira that the serum will have the same effect as the champagne Hasslein convinced her to drink earlier. As a result of the serum, Hasslein learns for himself that Zira examined and operated on humans in the future and indeed knew Taylor as well as Barnes who also arrived on their planet.Zira is taken to join Cornelius in confinement while the paranoid Hasslein takes his findings to the U.S. President (William Windom) who insists to the President that the apes are a danger to the human race. A little later, an orderly bringing food refers to the unborn child as a ""little monkey""; Cornelius has heard enough of the epithet and knocks the tray out of the orderly's hands and bashes him on the head with the tray, and uses this advantage to escape from the military base. At first, Cornelius thinks that he has only knocked the orderly unconscious, but he is later stunned to overhear that the man died. Hasslein uses the orderly's death and of Cornelius and Zira's escape as an illustration of the future danger the apes present and calls for the apes' execution. The President reluctantly orders that the unborn child's birth be terminated and that both chimpanzees be sterilized or killed.Running for their lives, Cornelius and Zira (assisted by Stephanie and Lewis) find shelter in a circus run by a Mexican national named Señor Armando (Ricardo Montalbán), where an ape named Heloise has just had a baby. There Zira gives birth to a son, whom she names Milo (later known as Caesar).Hasslein, knowing Zira will imminently give birth, orders a search of all circuses and zoos. As a result, Armando must send the apes away. Armando, Lewis and Stephanie provide them with maps and help them plan to hide until such time as they can escape into the Florida Everglades to live the rest of their lives in peace. In case they are discovered, Lewis gives Cornelius a pistol to use as a last resort. Zira asks to say goodbye to Heloise before they leave.Hasslein tracks the apes down to an abandoned ship in Long Beach harbor, and finds Zira resting with her infant. After a short chase through the ship and to the docked ship's stern, Hasslein shoots Zira in cold blood after she refuses to hand over her infant and then proceeds to fire several shots into the infant. Hasslein is immediately shot to death by Cornelius, and falls overboard. After Cornelius kills Hasslein, he is shot by several Marine Corps snipers and, as Stephanie and Lewis watch helplessly from the shore, falls to his death onto the poop deck of the ship. The mortally wounded Zira tosses her dead baby over the side of the ship before crawling to lie with her husband and dying by his side.But in the final scene in a surprising plot twist, Stephanie, Lewis and the other humans are unaware of the real fate of the infant ape. Earlier, Cornelius, Zira, and Armando switched babies with Heloise before their escape from the circus. Armando now watches over the infant Milo as the circus is being moved to a new location. Armando remarks how intelligent that the baby chimp is who will now survive with him at his circus. The final shot shows the baby ape Milo sitting in a cage, plaintively speaking the words ""Mama? Mama?"" with the voice of a human child."
tt0067093,"['Drama', 'Family', 'Musical', 'Romance']","Tevye (Topol), the philosophical village milkman, explains the customs of the Jewish people and their lives in the Russian shtetl of Anatevka in 1905, where life is as precarious as the perch of a fiddler on a roof (""Tradition""). At Tevye's home, everyone is busy preparing for the Sabbath meal. His sharp-tongued wife, Golde (Norma Crane), orders their five daughters, Tzeitel (Rosalind Harris), Hodel (Michele Marsh), Chava (Neva Small), Shprintze (Elaine Edwards), and Bielke (Candy Bonstein), about their tasks.Yente (Molly Picon), the village matchmaker, arrives with news for Golde. Lazar Wolf (Paul Mann), the wealthy butcher, a widower of Tevye's age, wants to wed Tzeitel, their eldest daughter. Tevye must be persuaded to meet Lazar to arrange the marriage. The two middle daughters, Hodel and Chava, speculate excitedly about what their mother and the matchmaker were talking about, but Tzeitel warns them not be so hasty. They are poor, so their parents will have no choice but to take whatever husband Yente brings (""Matchmaker""). Tzeitel is not eager to have a match found for her, as she is already in love with the tailor, Motel Kamzoil (Leonard Frey), her friend since childhood.Tevye's horse is lame, and he must pull the milk cart himself. He asks God, who it would hurt ""If I Were a Rich Man?"" The men of the village confront Tevye, as he is late delivering their milk and cheese. Avram (Alfie Scopp), the bookseller, has news from the outside world about pogroms and expulsions. A student from Kiev, Perchik (Paul Michael Glaser), newly arrived in town, hears their conversation and scolds them for doing nothing more than talk. The men dismiss Perchik as a radical, but Tevye takes a liking to him and invites him home for the Sabbath meal, offering him room and board in exchange for tutoring his two youngest daughters. Golde tells Tevye to meet Lazar Wolf after the Sabbath but does not tell him why, knowing that Tevye does not like Lazar. Tzeitel is afraid that Yente will find her a husband before Motel asks Tevye for her hand. But Motel resists: he is shy and afraid of Tevye's temper, and tradition says that a matchmaker arranges marriages. Motel is also very poor and is saving up to buy a sewing machine before he approaches Tevye, to show that he can support a wife. The family gathers around for the ""Sabbath Prayer.""After the Sabbath, Tevye visits Lazar Wolf. Teyve assumes that Lazar wants to buy his milk cow. After the misunderstanding is cleared up, Tevye agrees to let Lazar marry Tzeitel. With a rich butcher, he knows that his daughter will never go hungry. The two go to Mordcha's inn to seal their agreement with a drink. Many of the villagers are there, including a group of non-Jews. All join in the celebration of Lazar's good fortune; even the Russian youths at the inn join in the celebration and show off their dancing skills (""To Life""). Outside the inn, Tevye bumps into the Russian Constable (Louis Zorich), who has jurisdiction over the Jews in the town. The Constable warns him that there is going to be a ""demonstration"" in the coming weeks (a euphemism for a minor pogrom). The Constable has sympathy for the Jewish community but is powerless to prevent the violence.The next morning, a hungover Tevye delivers the news to his family that he has agreed that Tzeitel will marry Lazar Wolf. Golde is overjoyed, but Tzeitel is horrified and pleads with Tevye to reconsider. Motel arrives and gathers the courage to tell Tevye that he and Tzeitel gave each other a pledge to marry. Tevye is outraged at this breach of tradition, but Motel argues that even a poor tailor is entitled to some happiness. Tevye is impressed when the once-timid young tailor stands up for himself and, moved by his daughter's earnestness, gives his assent (""Tevye's Monologue""); but he worries about how to break the news to Golde. An overjoyed Motel celebrates with Tzeitel (""Miracle of Miracles"").That night in bed with Golde, Tevye has an inspiration: he tells Golde that he has had a nightmare (""Tevye's Dream""). She offers to interpret his dream, and Tevye ""describes"" it. Golde's grandmother Tzeitel (for whom their daughter is named) returned from the grave to bless the marriage of her namesake, but to Motel, not to Lazar Wolf. Lazar's formidable wife, Fruma Sarah, also rises from her grave to warn, in graphic terms, of severe retribution if Tzeitel marries Lazar. Tevye's superstitious wife is terrified, and she quickly agrees that Tzeitel must marry Motel, much to Tevye's secret relief.On the road outside of town, Tevye's middle daughter, the bookish Chava, is teased and intimidated by some Russian youths, but one of them, Fyedka (Ray Lovelock), protects her, dismissing the others. He offers Chava the loan of a book, and a secret relationship begins.The wedding day of Tzeitel and Motel arrives, and all the Jews join the ceremony (""Sunrise, Sunset"") and the celebration (""The Wedding Dance""). Lazar gives a fine gift, but an argument arises with Tevye over the broken agreement. Perchik ends the tiff by breaking another tradition: he crosses the barrier between the men and women to dance with Tevye's daughter Hodel. The celebration ends abruptly when a group of Russians rides into the village to perform the ""demonstration."" They disrupt the party, damaging the wedding gifts and wounding Perchik, who attempts to fight back, and wreaking more destruction in the village. Ever practical, Tevye advises everyone to clean up the mess.Months later, Perchik tells Hodel he must return to Kiev to work for the revolution. He proposes marriage, admitting that he loves her, and says that he will send for her. She agrees (""Now I Have Everything""). They tell Tevye that they are engaged, and he is appalled that they are flouting tradition by making their own match, especially as Perchik is leaving. When he forbids the marriage, Perchik and Hodel inform him that they do not seek his permission, only his blessing. After some soul searching, Tevye finally relents; the world is changing, and he must change with it (""Tevye's Rebuttal"").Tevye explains these events to an astonished Golde. ""Love,"" he says, ""it's the new style."" Tevye asks Golde, ""Do You Love Me?"" She admits that after 25 years of living and struggling together and raising five daughters, she does. Other events are moving apace. Yente tells Tzeitel that she saw Chava with Fyedka. News spreads quickly in Anatevka (""The Rumor""). Perchik has been arrested and exiled to Siberia, and Hodel is determined to join him there. At the railway station, she explains to her father that her home is with her beloved wherever he may be, yet she will always love her family (""Far from the Home I Love"").Weeks pass, and Chava finally gathers the courage to ask Tevye to allow her marriage to Fyedka. Again Tevye reaches deep into his soul, but marriage outside the Jewish faith is a line that he cannot cross. He forbids Chava ever to speak to Fyedka again. When Golde brings the news that Chava has eloped with Fyedka, Tevye wonders where he went wrong (""Chava Sequence""). Chava returns and tries to reason with him, but he refuses to speak to her and tells the rest of the family to consider her dead. Meanwhile, rumors are spreading of the Russians forcing Jewish villagers to leave their villages. While the villagers are gathered, the Constable arrives to tell everyone that they have three days to pack up and leave the town. In shock, they reminisce about the miserable town, and how hard it will be to leave what has for so long been their home (""Anatevka"").As the Jews leave Anatevka, Chava and Fyedka stop to tell her family that they too are leaving.

After an unsuccessful attempt, Junior Kilfong fires one shot from his double barrelled shotgun into Roy K. Sizemore knocking him to the ground. After Appleyard, Johnny, and Cottrill depart on another train, Council identifies Sizemore as being an innocent bystander and shoots Sizemore in the head with a revolver, making the remark ""Looks like Appleyard's a murderer again,"" meaning that Appleyard was going to be setup to be either arrested or shot on site for the murder of a salesman. But not before Appleyard retrieved the salesman's goods (one suitcase full of dynamite). Hence the alternative name of the film ""Dynamite Man from Glory Jail.""The next morning, Appleyard enters the ""Bank of Glory"" which after a brief verbal altercation with a now stunned Grindstaff, and Council, lights the dynamite that is now strapped around his chest from . After Grindstaff pays Appleyard, the convicts head down to the train depot to catch a freight train out of Glory. Johnny and Lee meet up with Chanty, a shy 16 year old riverboat ""working girl"" played and Sonny Boy. After Lee agrees to get himself a drink of whiskey, Johnny stays on the river bank to wait for Appleyard). On the riverboat, Lee encounters Cleo. After Cleo realizes who was going to meet Lee on the riverboat, and hearing about the large amount of money that Appleyard has, she lures them all on the boat and takes the case, not knowing that the money is actually on Appleyard's person now and all that the case contains is the remainder of the dynamite. During this time, Johnny encounters Chanty, and fall in love instantly. The three take Chanty off the boat with them. After Cleo attempts to shoot the case, the case blows the riverboat up in pieces.After a sighting by Council on a box car freight train at the depot, Council pursues Appleyard and his gang, but not after being picked up by the train conductor to be transported out into the wooded area of now Marshall County, West Virginia. After eluding Council, Steve and Junior, Appleyard and gang end up at an abandoned house. Council, scaling the hillsides of Marshall County observes what is smoke from a chimney from afar. Knowing that he would now have to split the profit between Steve and Junior, he guns down both Steve and Junior on a Marshall County hillside and makes his way to the abandoned house.Once at the abandoned house, Appleyard knows something is not right. He can sense the presence of someone. After Johnny and Chanty are awakened by something outside, Johnny runs upstairs to warn Appleyard and Cottrill. When doing so, Council fires a shotgun round through an upstairs window, striking the window sending glass and debris onto Appleyard, injuring him. Knowing that Appleyard had dynamite on him, Johnny and Lee prepare to throw dynamite at Council in the attempt to kill him. When doing so, Council's dog, Joey, picks up the lighted stick of dynamite and carries it back upstairs. At this time, the dog drops the dynamite, only for Appleyard to pick it up and throw it out the window, only this time, the dynamite laying next to Council. The dynamite exploded and thus killed Council.The next scene shows Appleyard, Johnny, Lee, and Chanty inside the Marshall County Court House, being escorted outside by Police. With Grindstaff looking from his bank office window, which was located next to the Marshall County Court House, the Prosecuting Attorney enters with Appleyard.

After a brief pause of motion from Grindstaff, he (Grindstaff) made the check out to Appleyard. After Appleyard received the check, he asked if it was cashable anywhere in the State. He was told ""Anywhere from Wheeling to Stone Coal"". Knowing his misfortune, Appleyard walks up to the teller and asks to cash his check. After the crowd cheers outside the bank, they depart for the train station.While onboard, Appleyard was warned by ""Tighe"" (the glass eye) that something was about to happen. The train conductor who had helped Appleyard elude Council pulled the emergency stop on the train and stated that they were being followed. While the three ex-cons and Chanty exited the train, it was Council's dog who had been friends with Johnny all through his prison sentence who had been following the train, barking. After the dog is hugged by Johnny, they all get back on the train, and head away in the distance."
tt0067116,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","In December 1970 in Marseilles, France, a plainclothes policeman is observing former longshoreman turned entrepreneur Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) chatting with some unsavory types. Charnier is being tailed by the undercover cop because he is a kingpin in smuggling heroin overseas - a fact that costs the cop his life when he later returns home and is shot in the face by Pierre Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi), Charnier's henchman.Meanwhile, in Brooklyn, NY, a corner Santa is chatting with some children outside a seedy bar while a hotdog vendor completes a transaction. The Santa is Detective Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and the vendor is his partner, Detective Salvatore Russo (Roy Scheider), whom Doyle nicknames ""Cloudy."" The two narcotics cops are staking out the bar in hope of finding a pusher named Willie (Alan Weeks). When Popeye sees Willie in the bar passing some drugs to a companion, he starts singing to the children, his signal to Cloudy. Cloudy enters the bar and grabs Willie's buddy. Willie sees the commotion and suddenly flees outside, with Popeye and Cloudy in hot pursuit. They corner him in an alley and Willie slashes Cloudy's arm with a hidden knife and runs. The cops chase him on foot to a deserted lot where he trips and falls and is beaten by both cops before Russo implores Doyle to stop. Once the two cops calm down they confusingly interrogate Willie, trying to get information on his drug connection.In France, Charnier finishes a day overseeing dock work and drives home to his seaside villa and his young trophy wife (Ann Rebbot), who obviously has expensive tastes. The two exchange gifts for their upcoming trip to the US. Charnier later meets his gunman Nicoli at a rendezvous point for an acquaintance of Charnier, TV personality Henri Devereaux (Frédéric de Pasquale). Devereaux is traveling to the US to make a film and has decided to aid Charnier's smuggling effort because he needs money. Nicoli believes involving Devereaux is a mistake, but is reassured by Charnier.In NYC, Popeye and Cloudy sign off for the night and Popeye takes his reluctant partner to a nightclub called The Chez. Popeye notices one table in particular, populated by known narcotics connections who are being entertained by a free-spending young man whom Popeye describes as a ""greaser."" Popeye smells a drug deal underway and persuades Cloudy to help him tail the greaser and his companion, a big-haired blonde. Throughout the night they tail the two, watching them drop off a suitcase in Little Italy and then switch cars early the next morning from an attractive coupe to a beat-up sedan. They then drive to a candy store/luncheonette, ""Sal and Angie's"", in a working-class area of Brooklyn. Peering inside as the couple prepares to open for the day, Popeye and Cloudy notice that the blonde is now a brunette, having worn a wig the night before.Realizing they are on to something, the two cops stake out the candy store for a week using audio surveillance. Cloudy poses as a photographer to question Angie. Combing records they find that the greaser is Salvatore ""Sal"" Boca (Tony Lo Bianco) and his wife is Angie (Arlene Farber). The candy store's income could not explain Sal's free-spending ways. The posh coupe is owned by Angie while the beat-up sedan is owned by Sal's brother Lou (Benny Marino), a garbageman in training at a facility on Ward's Island in the East River. All three Bocas have criminal records. The candy store is regularly visited by unsavory types from New Jersey, and Sal makes numerous trips to an expensive condo in Manhattan at which lives lawyer Joel Weinstock (Harold Gary), a known drug financier who bankrolled a heroin shipment from Mexico.Popeye and Cloudy raid a junk-house bar. One Afro-haired patron (Al Fann) talks back at Popeye and is hauled into a men's room to be beaten up - actually cover so Popeye can debrief his informant, who reveals that a big shipment is due within a few weeks that will satisfy everyone in the city. In order to make the ruse look convincing, Popeye punches his colleague in the jaw, a bit too enthusiastically.Popeye's boss, Walt Simonson (Eddie Egan, the real-life inspiration for Popeye Doyle), is reluctant to let the two cops continue with their investigation of Boca, pointedly reminding Popeye of a previous case where his hunches backfired. But with Joel Weinstock, whom the police have long wanted to arrest, potentially involved, Simonson relents and goes to court for a wiretap on Boca's house and candy store. The federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) now becomes involved and assigns Agents Bill Mulderig (Bill Hickman) and Bill Klein (Sonny Grosso, the real-life inspiration for Cloudy Russo), who've worked with Popeye before; Popeye and Mulderig are at constant loggerheads because Mulderig blames Popeye for the death of a policeman in a previous case and doesn't believe Popeye's hunches to begin with.Charnier, Nicoli, and Devereaux arrive in NYC and Devereaux brings with him Charnier's Lincoln, signed for in Charnier's stead. They speak fair English, but nonetheless have an interpreter, La Valle (Andre Ernotte), with them. La Valle escorts Charnier to a police auction of impounded cars and identifies Lou Boca as the scrap metal buyer for Charnier's business (suggesting how the Bocas may have linked up with Charnier).After several days of monitoring mundane conversations, the wiretap finally brings Popeye and Cloudy their first break - Charnier phones Sal to arrange a 12 o'clock meeting the next day. Popeye, Cloudy, and Mulderig tail Sal to midtown Manhattan, where they spot Sal meeting with Charnier and Nicoli. While Mulderig follows Sal, Popeye and Cloudy tail Charnier, dubbed ""Frog One,"" and Nicoli as they walk through the city. The Frenchmen stop to eat at an expensive restaurant, which the cops observe while standing outside in freezing temperatures and eating bad pizza with worse coffee. Later, Popeye finds out that Frog One is staying at the Westbury Hotel, but Mulderig still doesn't believe Popeye is on to anything, leading to a brief argument.At Joel Weinstock's condo, a young dope chemist (Pat McDermott) tests a sample of Charnier's heroin and it measures to 89% pure. There are sixty kilos due to arrive; when cut down into ""dime bags"" it will total out to $32 million with a half-million cash down payment. Weinstock, however, wants to wait before the switch is made, much to Sal's displeasure as Sal fears that Charnier will abort the deal if Weinstock drags it out too long.The next day Popeye arrives at the Westbury just in time to see Charnier breeze right by the distracted Mulderig and Klein and walk into the city without a tail. Popeye tails Charnier himself, almost loses him at a flower shop, but then picks him up again at the Grand Central subway station. They play a cat-and-mouse game on the platform, but the wily Charnier manages to hop back on a train at the last moment and waves goodbye as the furious Popeye futilely runs after the train.Charnier meets Sal in Washington DC - Sal followed there by Klein - where Charnier insists that the deal must be consummated by the end of the week, despite Sal's protests that his mob pals want to wait. On the flight back to New York, Charnier expresses his worries to Nicoli, who points out that Sal's concern about the police is warranted. The Frenchmen agree that Doyle is the main problem, and Nicoli volunteers to assassinate Doyle. Charnier reluctantly agrees, unaware that a fight has erupted between Popeye and Mulderig, and that Popeye has been taken off the case by a furious Simonson.The dejected Popeye returns to his Brooklyn apartment building, where he is fired upon by Nicoli from the roof. Popeye manages to enter the building and pursues Nicoli to the roof, and then back down when he sees Nicoli fleeing. Nicoli runs to a nearby elevated train station and boards the train while Popeye screams for a uniformed transit policeman on board to stop him. As the train leaves the station, the transit policeman follows Nicoli as he moves forward through the train. Popeye commandeers a Pontiac Le Mans from a flabbergasted citizen. Nicoli kills the transit cop and seizes the motorman, forcing him to keep the train going through all the regular stops. Popeye furiously pursues in the car, barely escaping as other cars sideswipe him, and he nearly strikes a woman pushing her child in a baby carriage. Nicoli then kills the conductor who tries to intervene, and the crowd on the train flees while the terrified motorman collapses with a heart attack, locking the train on a collision course with a stopped train. The two trains crash and passengers, including Nicoli, are thrown about. Despite injuries and losing his gun, Nicoli slips out undetected - by everyone except Popeye. Nicoli starts down the stairs but is cornered by Popeye, and when he tries to flee he is shot dead.Popeye and Cloudy, now back on the case, tail Sal as he takes the Lincoln from a parking garage to a side street. The police stake out the car all night; at 4:10 AM a gang of thieves tries to strip it, but they are arrested by a horde of policemen and the car is towed to a garage to be searched as evidence. The mechanic (Irving Abrahams), cannot find any narcotics in the car, but Popeye refuses to believe it. While Devereaux (who signed for the car) and La Valle argue with the garage desk sergeant, Cloudy notices a 120-pound discrepancy between the car's listed weight and actual weight. The mechanic reveals one area he didn't open up - the car's rocker panels underneath the doors. Popeye chews him out and then helps open up these panels, and the stash is found. The car is replaced (either repaired or the department acquires another, intact one), the stash replaced, and it is returned to Devereaux, while the police now wait for the dealers to make their final move.Devereaux meets again with Charnier and is reluctant to do any more favors, until Charnier reveals that Devereaux is now an accomplice - to Devereaux's surprise and horror. Devereaux walks away, but Charnier takes the car himself and drives it to Ward's Island, where Lou Boca directs him to an abandoned factory building. There the heroin stash is revealed and tested positively. The stash is hidden inside the building and cash payment is hidden in the rocker panels of the junker car Lou Boca bought. With the deal completed, the Bocas briefly celebrate and Sal drives Charnier back to the city - and right into a police roadblock led by Popeye. Sal drives back to the factory with police in pursuit, and the mobsters hide inside the main building while Charnier hides in a secondary building. A gunfight ensues, in which Sal Boca is shot dead. Popeye hunts for Charnier inside the dilapidated warehouse. Cloudy joins him as Popeye appears to have cornered Charnier, but as the two cops approach the room Popeye sees someone from another door. He opens fire before Cloudy can corner the now-dead man - who turns out to be Agent Mulderig. Determined to get Frog One at any cost, and not caring that he just killed a Federal agent, Popeye strides through the warehouse, believing the Frenchman is still in hiding. After he rounds a corner a single gunshot is heard.In an epilogue, it is revealed that Weinstock and the surviving Bocas either skated or received peripheral sentences while Henri Devereaux wound up in federal prison for four years; Charnier escaped and is believed to be living in France, and Doyle and Russo were suspended from narcotics duty.(Note: The French Connection drug bust that inspired the film took place in 1961. However, the film's script sets the action at the time of actual filming, i.e. the winter of 1970-71, in order to avoid the need for period accuracy in the many New York street scenes.)"

Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger), a Mexican outlaw leading a bandit family, flags down a large stagecoach wanting a ride. He forces the coach to stop where his family, consisting of his many sons and accomplices, rob the stagecoach. Juan chases down and rapes a woman from the coach who had insulted him upon his arrival as a ""peon"". Juan and his group strip the men of their clothing and leave them tumbling down a hill.Afterwords, Juan and his group hear explosions in the distance. Venturing to the source of the sounds, the Mexican bandit family meets John 'Sean' Mallory (James Coburn), an Irish Republican explosives expert on the run from the British. Noting his skill with explosives, Juan relentlessly tries to make him join them a raid on the Mesa Verde national bank. After John initially refuses, Juan frames him for the murder of his employer and several soldiers, making him a wanted criminal and offering to ""protect"" him in exchange for his help. John reluctantly agrees to help Juan rob the bank, but escapes on the way to Mesa Verde by climbing aboard a moving train.Arriving in the city before Juan, John makes contact with Mexican revolutionaries led by physician Dr. Villega (Romolo Valli) and agrees to use his explosives in their service. When Juan and his family arrive by train, John inducts him into the revolutionaries' ranks. The bank is hit as part of an orchestrated attack on the Mexican army. Juan, interested only in the bank's money, is shocked to find that it has no funds and is instead being used by the army as a political prison. John, Juan and his family end up freeing hundreds of prisoners, inadvertently (and against his wishes) causing Juan to become a ""great, grand, glorious hero of the revolution.""The revolutionaries are chased into the hills by a Mexican army detachment led by Colonel Günther Reza (Antoine Saint-John). John and Juan volunteer to stay behind with two machine guns and dynamite. Much of the army's detachment is destroyed while crossing a bridge which is machine gunned by them and blown to bits by John. Col. Reza who commands an armored car, survives.After the battle, John and Juan find most of their comrades, including Juan's family and children, have been killed by the army in a cave hideout. Engulfed with grief and rage, Juan goes out to fight the army single handed and is captured. John sneaks into camp where he witnesses executions of many of his fellow revolutionaries by firing squad. They had been informed on by Dr. Villega, who has been tortured by Col. Reza and his men. This evokes in John memories of a similar betrayal by Nolan (David Warbeck), his best friend, whom John kills for informing. Juan faces a firing squad of his own, but John arrives and blows up the squad and the wall with dynamite just in time. They escape on a motorcycle John is driving.John and Juan hide in the animal coach of a train. It stops to pick up the tyrannical Governor Don Jaime (Franco Graziosi), who is fleeing (with a small fortune) from the revolutionary forces belonging to Pancho Villa of the North and Emiliano Zapata of the South. As the train is ambushed by Mexican rebels, John, as a test of Juan's loyalty, lets him choose between shooting the Governor and accepting a bribe from him. Juan kills Jaime, and also steals the Governor's spoils. As the doors to the coach open, Juan is greeted by a large crowd and again unexpectedly hailed as a great hero of the revolution. He throws the money back into the coach to John.On a train with commanders of the revolution, John and Juan are joined by Dr. Villega, who has escaped. John alone knows of Villega's betrayal. They learn that Pancho Villa's forces will be delayed by 24 hours and that an army train carrying 1,000 soldiers and heavy weapons, led by Col. Reza, will be arriving in just three hours after dark, which will surely overpower the rebel position. John suggests they rig a locomotive with dynamite and send it head on. He requires one other man, but instead of picking Juan, who volunteers, he chooses Dr. Villega. It becomes clear to Villega that he knows of the betrayal. John nonetheless pleads with him to jump off the locomotive before it hits the army's train, but Villega feels guilty and stays on board. John jumps in time and the two trains collide, killing Villega and a number of soldiers.The revolutionaries' ambush is successful, but as John approaches to meet Juan, he is shot in the back by Col. Reza. An enraged Juan riddles the Colonel's body with a machine gun. As John lies dying, he continues to have memories of his best friend, Nolan, and a young woman both apparently loved. John recalls killing Nolan after being betrayed by him to the law. Juan kneels by his side to ask about Dr. Villega. John keeps the doctor's secret and tells Juan that he died a hero of the revolution. As Juan goes to seek help, John has a flashback to his time in Ireland with Nolan and a girl whom they both were in love with; knowing his end is near, sets off a second charge he secretly laid in case the battle went bad. The film ends with Juan staring at the burning remains, asking forlornly: ""What about me?"""

As the guests prepare to leave, one of them, the sceptical Dr. Pritchard [Eric Porter], notices Anna's foot underneath a curtain and stands on it, revealing the hidden Anna.

Dysart becomes angry and attacks her. Mrs Golding enters to break up the quarrel but as she hugs and kisses Anna to comfort her, it reminds Anna of her father hugging her and she picks up a fire poker and stabs Mrs Golding. Dysart flees as Pritchard enters to investigate and finds Mrs Golding impaled to a door.At the police station the police inspector [Norman Bird] interviews those people who were at the séance. He is puzzled because it would have taken a very strong person to impale Mrs Golding. He establishes that Mr & Mrs Wilson left first, followed by Pritchard and Michael, but no-one saw Dysart leave. Although Pritchard knows the truth, he saves Dysart's embarrassment by stating it could have been possible for Dysart to leave shortly afterwards without anyone seeing him and that he does not believe Dysart was the man he saw leaving after the murder.At a railway station, Michael meets his blind fiancée Laura [Jane Merrow] and they return to the Pritchard's house.Pritchard visits Anna in the police cells but she does not have any memory of the murder. Since Pritchard is a psychiatric doctor he arranges Anna's release to his care. He takes her home and to his late wife's room and instructs the maid Dolly [Marjie Lawrence] to look after her.Pritchard introduces Anna to Michael and Laura before going to his study where Dysart is waiting. Pritchard explains he lied to save Dysart because it served him a purpose. Dysart explains he witnessed Anna killing Mrs Golding and that she was like a possessed being. Pritchard has studied Freud and believes she is schizophrenic and explains her brought her home so he can study her. He requests Dysart assist by finding out as much as he can about Anna's past. Dysart is concerned Anna may kill again but Pritchard blackmails him into helping by reminding him he could change his story to the police and put the suspicion back on Dysart.That evening Pritchard attends a ball with Michael and Laura but Anna does not arrive. Dolly is still assisting Anna to get dressed but when she places a jeweled necklace around Anna's neck, the reflections send Anna into a trance again. When Dolly gives her a hug and kiss, Anna hears her father's voice and she cuts Dolly's throat with a broken piece of glass. Pritchard returns from the ball and finds Anna still in the trance with her bloodied hands still holding the necklace. He finds Dolly's body in the bathroom so takes Anna to his study where he gives her a sedative and straps her to a bed. He returns to the room to dispose of Dolly's body but is nearly caught in the act by the housekeeper Mrs. Bryant [Marjorie Rhodes].Next day Pritchard meets Dysart for an update.

The reflections from Madame Bullard's spectacles send Anna into a trance. Madame Bullard detects a feeling of violence in Anna and has a vision of Anna's father murdering her mother. She sees it is Jack the Ripper but she can't tell Pritchard the true identity of the serial killer. Madame Bullard believes Anna is possessed by the spirit of her father and gives her a hug, but Anna stabs her with the frame of Madame Bullard's spectacles.Pritchard and Anna return home where Dysart is waiting. They argue about whether Anna is really possessed by the spirit of Jack the Ripper. Pritchard puts Anna into hypnotic sleep then explains to Dysart he believes the flickering light sends Anna into a safe place that she associates with an escape from former brutalities. Dysart is concerned about her violence so Pritchard tries to convince him by reflecting light from the jeweled broach into her eyes again. Dysart is not convinced and thinks she should be hung for the murders.After Dysart leaves Pritchard returns to Anna and apologises for failing her, kissing her in the process. She hears her father's voice and impales Pritchard with a sword. Anna leaves the house with Michael and Laura. Although seriously injured Pritchard manages to extract the sword. Anna and Laura go to St. Paul's Cathedral where they climb the steps to the whispering gallery. Pritchard takes a carriage to find Michael and they continue on to St. Paul's.

The buz is then soaked in water for 24 hours before the game, so that it may be tough enough for the horsemen to handle. Sometimes, sand is packed inside for extra bulk. A goat may also be used if there is no calf available.The chapendaz are master horsemen who have undergone arduous training. They wear thick hats (traditionally made of fox or wolf skins), quilted jackets, high, stiff leather boots, and they wind strong scarves around their waists. They carry short whips made of a handle attached to a foot-long piece of braided leather.The rules of the game are simple. The headless carcass is placed on the ground in the center of a circle (the ""hallal"" or circle of justice in Turkomen). The players may consist of opposing teams, or of individuals playing singly. The riders surround the hallal, trying to grab the buz, after which they bring it to the scoring area. In order to reach this goal, anything goes. The chapendaz not only whip their horses, but the other riders, and especially the one who has the buz. In the past, the chapendaz carried chains and even knives, and sometimes stabbed an opponents horse or even its rider, in an attempt to steal the buz. These practices are now forbidden now that we are civilized. Broken limbs frequently occur, but those do not stop the game, and the bandaged chapendaz is soon back in the saddle.There are two types of buzkashi. The first is the ""tudabarai,"" where in order to score, the rider must obtain possession of the buz and carry it away in any direction. The rider must stay free and clear of the other riders. In the second type, the ""Qarajai,"" the rider must carry the buz around two poles placed approximately one mile apart, and bring it back to the hallal. In this film, both types of buzkashi are shown.Afghans remember the stories of famous horses, horsemen and the great battles in which they displayed their skill and courage. To many Afghans, the buzkashi is not a game, it is a way of life, and a chapendaz is regarded as an honored member of the society.The FilmThe action takes place on the vast plains around Maimana in the northwest of the country, across the forbidding Hindu Kush, and in Kabul. Although the scenery and characters are timeless, the sight of a high-flying jet during a scene subtly establishes the movie's time period. The drama revolves around the ""mad horse,"" Jahil, with its almost human presence.The film opens with the movie credits rolling over the spectacular vista of the string of lapis lazuli blue lakes of Band-i-Amir. These lakes, a marvel of nature, are located at an altitude of seven thousand feet in the midst of a desert in Central Afghanistan.In the first scene, near the northern town of Maimana, we find Uraz (Omar Sharif) watching two Bactrian camels fight to the death in an enclosure. A crowd of excited aficionados and gamblers watches the duel's progress. Most Afghans are inveterate gamblers, betting on the outcomes of every type of arranged combats between animals: rams, dogs, partridges, crickets, you name it. They'll even bet on eggs (but this is not the place to explain how this works). A mysterious and likable character, Hayatal (Peter Jeffrey) appears next to Uraz and challenges him to bet on the outcome of the camel fight. An important trait of Urazs character is revealed as he permits the stranger to choose first. Obviously, Uraz cares more about the competition of betting than he does about winning. Before the camel fight ends, Uraz is summoned by his father, Tursen (Jack Palance), so he pays off Hayatal without waiting for the finish. Any other person interested in financial gain may have found this summons a good excuse for not paying, since Uraz's choice was obviously going to lose the fight. Earlier, when Hayatal asked an old lady in the bazaar about Uraz, she said, ""If you wager him for glory, you will lose. If for money, you will win.""In the village, Uraz meets his father, manager of the stables of the honorable Ozman Bay, a wealthy local land owner. Uraz is to ride Jahil, Tursen's latest prized white stallion, in the great buzkashi of the King, to be held in Kabul. If Uraz wins, Jahil is his to keep. How can he not win? ""If you cannot win on Jahil, you cannot win on any horse,"" says Tursen sarcastically. Uraz, like his father before him, is now the most famous chapendaz in the ""three provinces."" Nevertheless, his quest for glory seems endless, as an inner demon keeps driving him to surpass both his father and himself.At the buzkashi in Kabul, Uraz will know defeat. He not only loses the game, but his leg is fractured. His life lesson about pain and hate begins as he returns to Maimana, vanquished, prouder, more resolute, and crazier than ever.Uraz has the choice of two roads to return to Maimana: the relatively easy road across the terrible Hindu Kush Range, through the Salang Pass, the world's highest pass at ten thousand feet, or the dreadful ""ancient road,"" running through the Unai and Hajikak passes, both also near ten thousand feet, Bamiyan, followed by more high passes, before finally arriving on the northern steppes. Of course, Uraz chooses the ""ancient road,"" challenging himself to the limit, in order to redeem himself in his own eyes, and also those of his father. For all his toughness, his father had never traveled that road.As if the ""ancient road"" were not challenge enough, Uraz, whose fractured leg is fast becoming gangrenous, tempts his ""sais"" (groom), Mokkhi (David de Keyser), with a pact that involves ownership of the magnificent Jahil.Along the way, they meet a beautiful ""untouchable,"" Zareh (Leigh Taylor-Young). For her, it is love at first sight with the horse. She tags along the group in their journey to the north, determined to somehow take possession of Jahil. During this infernal trip, Mukkhi meets with love in the arms of Zareh, but also experiences greed, a taste for murder, and a pitiful downfall. Zareh, as beautiful as she is devious, inspires Mokkhi to murder and destruction. She is herself tormented by ""the horse"": ""Do you know, great Prince (Uraz), what brought me to you that first night? It was the horse."" Along this endless ""ancient road,"" the trio each confronts the worst in themselves, and arrive at their destination perverted and lost.Following a hellish snow storm, Uraz is separated from his two companions. Totally unconscious, he is still riding Jahil who takes him to the safety of a shepherds camp. Uraz wakes up in the presence of Mizrar (George Murcell), the chief shepherd of the local lord, who tells him that ""It must come off, son of Tursen."" And Mizrar amputates the rotten leg, as he would have done to one of his sheep.Eventually, Uraz returns to his home. There is a poignant exchange between father and son, following which the judgment of Mukkih and of Zareh, who had been captured by Tursen's men, is pronounced by Uraz, and Tursen further humiliates Uraz, in a final twist involving Jahil, the horse.Finally, a great feast is given to honor the victory of Urazs team at the buzkashi of the King, won by his teammate Salih. Uraz appears unannounced on horseback at the celebration and give a virtuoso demonstrates of his horsemanship before the assembly. The next day, he and his new traveling companion, Hayatal, leave for an endless journey across the steppes, in search of glory in more buzkashi competitions. Uraz says, ""The journey is from nowhere to nowhere. It suits me."""
tt0067229,"['Horror', 'contentRating', 'R']","The film opens on a bizarre Satanic ritual being conducted by a long-haired hippie type named Horace Bones. Nude and freaked out on LSD, Horace and his small group of cohorts are oblivious to the fact that they're being watched by Sylvia, a young girl observing them from the trees. One of the hippies is pregnant and is not taking part in the ritual; she sees Sylvia and drags her into the clearing, where Horace freaks out over the fact that their ritual has been observed. A more recent member of the group, Andy, admits that he met Sylvia in town and invited her along, prompting Horace to violently hit him. Sylvia becomes frightened and runs away, but two other members of the group chase after her and catch her in the woods, where they brutalize her.The next morning, Sylvia emerges from the woods beaten and apparently raped. She is found by Mildred, the woman who runs the small town's bakery. With Mildred is Pete, Sylvia's younger brother who appears to be about 12 or 13. Together, they take Sylvia back home to where she lives with Pete and their grandfather, Banner. Mildred is sure her boyfriend will know who victimized Sylvia--with the town deserted, the only other people in the area are the construction crew working on a dam near the town. Mildred drives to the dam and informs her boyfriend, who works at the site. He tells her he will look into it.Meanwhile, Horace and his group have discovered that their van is now broken down and useless. They abandon it in the woods and walk to the town on foot. The first thing they see is the bakery, and Mildred sells them meat pies, throwing in a few extra things as a kindness for them. Horace tells them that he and his friends are rock musicians stranded there, and he asks where they can seek shelter. Mildred explains that Valley Hills only has a few residents, most of them long gone. Only she and a few others remain, awaiting the demolition of the town in the near future. Upon hearing this, Horace and the others move into one of the abandoned houses, smashing things and hunting the many rats inside of it for food. Pete follows them to the house and witnesses their bizarre behavior. When he returns home, Sylvia has come out of her shock and informed Banner about what happened to her. Pete overhears and reveals that he knows where the hippies are staying. Banner takes a shotgun and sets out for revenge. When Banner encounters the hippies at the house, they disarm him and brutalize him, forcing LSD into his mouth. Pete, who has followed Banner, overhears the incident from outside. Horace apparently wants to kill Banner, as well as Pete, but a female member named Sue-Lin convinces Horace to let them go, fearing intervention by the police.Banner is tripping when he gets home, and Pete is distressed. Sylvia explains that the hippies dosed him with LSD, and Pete becomes angry. Taking the shotgun, he goes outside the house, but the first thing he encounters is a wild dog that is apparently rabid. Pete kills it and returns later with some of his father's equipment. Using a syringe, he takes infected blood from the dog. The next day, he injects the rabid blood into the meat pies in Mildred's bakery, as a means of getting back at the hippies. Just as Pete planned, the hippies return to the bakery and purchase the meat pies.Back at their house, Horace and the others eat the meat pies. Andy is the only one who does not partake--he is uneasy about the violence he has witnessed and he wants to disassociate himself from the group, leaving the house. The others begin to show signs of being sick, and eventually they lapse into animalistic behavior. Rollo, a member of the group, takes a dagger and stabs another group member named Roger to death with it. In a feral rage, he rushes out into the yard and finds an axe, returning to chop off Roger's leg with it. Horace also turns violent, grabbing a sword and threatening other members of the group with it.A female hippie named Molly becomes terrified and rushes off into the night. Construction workers sent there by Mildred's boyfriend find Molly and take her with them. Molly uses her sex appeal to insinuate herself into their group, and she spends the rest of the night having sex with all of them. Finally, Molly begins to freak out, biting one of the men. Two other construction workers are killed when they venture into the house of the hippies and encounter a now-crazed Horace, who hangs one of them and guts the other.Banner discovers what is going on when Horace attacks Mildred's car and leaves bloody handprints behind. Andy returns to the Banner house and hides out in their barn; after making peace with Sylvia, they are discovered in the barn by Andy, who admits what he's done. Andy explains that he didn't eat the pies, so he is not infected. Banner has informed others about the potential rabies epidemic, and the next day they are joined by Dr. Oakes. Banner, Oakes, and Mildred's boyfriend all discover that the entire construction crew are now rabid maniacs; the entire town is engulfed by them and the hippies, all of them homicidally crazy and prone to mindless acts of violence. Even two seemingly gentle hippie girls, one of them pregnant, happen upon a woman's home. When she takes them in, they wind up cutting off her hand with an electric carving knife. Oakes and the others discover that water terrifies the rabids, and they are nearly killed by a large group of them before they reach a water-filled quarry, which frightens them off.Andy helps Sylvia and Pete escape after they discover Banner dead in the barn, impaled by a pitchfork. While running through the woods, they happen upon the pregnant hippie, who impales herself on a wooden stake after she learns she has rabies. When they emerge from the woods, they discover Rollo and Horace lurking near the bakery; fortunately they become interested in each other, allowing the normals to escape. Rollo and Horace clash, each of them armed, until Rollo impales Horace with a sword. Andy, Sylvia and Pete discover Mildred barricaded inside the bakery, but she is too afraid to let them inside. When she finally manages to undo the barricade, Andy has been beheaded by a machete-wielding madman. Sylvia and Pete retreat with her to the basement of the bakery, but unfortunately they cannot lock the basement door. A rabid gets inside, and Mildred shoots him in the head. They rush out of the bakery and try to drive away in Mildred's car, but it won't start; the crowd of brawling rabids converge on them and overturn the car. Just then, Oakes arrives with a slew of policemen and medics, and soon all of the rabids have been shot dead. Mildred, Sylvia, and Pete all emerge from the car, shaken but otherwise unharmed."

Along with Jane McKenna and Arlyn Page, she used to work for pimp Frank Ligourin (Roy Scheider). Bree quits working full-time as a prostitute after a serious encounter with a violent customer.The movie opens with Tom Gruneman and his wife hosting a social gathering at their house in Tuscarora, Pennsylvania. Their guests include Tom's colleague Peter Cable (Charles Cioffi) and Tom's friend/policeman John Klute (Donald Sutherland).Soon after, Tom Gruneman disappears without a trace and the police perform an investigation. They find an obscene letter to Bree Daniels at Gruneman's office in his desk. Daniels is contacted and she confirms that she had received several such letters but does not recognize Tom when shown a photograph. Daniels is arrested for prostitution. When released, she severs her relationship with Ligourin and begins to freelance and make her own contacts with customers. She leaves Park Avenue and moves into a small apartment and begins to worry that someone is following her.After six months of investigating Tom Gruneman's disappearance, the Police are at a dead end. Peter Cable hires John Klute to go to New York City and continue the investigation.Klute moves into a basement apartment in the same building where Daniels lives. He taps her telephone and records her telephone conversations. He then contacts Daniels and asks for her help in solving Gruneman's disappearance. Although initially reluctant, Daniels eventually cooperates with the persistent Klute who provides her protection from whomever is stalking her. Bree tries to manipulate Klute using sex but eventually she actually comes to care for him when he helps her get away from her former pimp.Klute learns that Jane McKenna (one of Frank Ligourin's former prostitutes at the time Bree was with him) apparently committed suicide. Then Aryln Page, another prostitute from Bree's past, whom Klute tracks down and also fails to recognize Tom's picture, is subsequently found dead.As Klute's investigation continues, it becomes evident that:
(1) The same man mistreated Bree Daniels and the other two prostitutes of Frank Ligourin;
(2) The man used Tom Gruneman's name when he was with the prostitutes;
(3) The man murdered Jane McKenna and Arlyn Page and probably Tom Gruneman
Klute eventually investigates Tom's friends and identifies Peter Cable based on the typewriter used to type the obscene letters and his writing style and consistent typing errors.The killer is not a mystery to viewers as Peter Cable is shown several times throughout the movie listening to tapes he had recorded of the sexual encounters and murders on a small tape recorder.
It is unclear why Cable thought it necessary to try to frame Gruneman (by planting the letter to Daniels in Gruneman's desk) or why Cable hired Klute to continue the investigation when the police had come to a dead end.Cable follows and attempts to kill Daniels, but Klute arrives just in time to save Daniels and Cable falls out the window to his death.Daniels moves out of her apartment to go with Klute who she has fallen in love with although she doubts she will be able to convert to a domestic life."

Sonny relaxes with his friends, Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), the aging but still vital cowboy who owns the small town's cafe, pool hall and movie theater, and Sam's ward, the mute, gentle, simple-minded Billy (Sam Bottoms).Sonny and Duane have breakfast at the cafe, run by salty-tongued waitress Genevieve (Eileen Brennan), and discuss their usual Saturday night plans of seeing the ""picture show"" and necking with their girl friends in the pickup they jointly own. Sonny goes to work and that night, while Duane and his blonde girl friend, Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd), take the first turn in the pickup, Sonny joins his girl, Charlene Duggs (Sharon Taggart), in the theater. The unpleasant and bickering Charlene complains that Sonny has forgotten their one year anniversary, but Sonny is more interested in watching Jacy, the most beautiful and wealthiest girl in town, as she and Duane come into the theater and begin to kiss. Sonny and Charlene then take their turn in the pickup, but the frustrated Sonny, longing to do more than fondle Charlene's breasts, ends their stale relationship when she becomes petulant. Later at the cafe, Genevieve comforts Sonny and wonders why both he and Duane live in a boardinghouse rather than with their parents.At basketball practice one afternoon, Coach Popper offers to get Sonny excused from class the next day for driving the coach's wife Ruth (Cloris Leachman) to her doctor's appointment, and Sonny agrees. That night, Jacy is confronted by her alcoholic mother Lois (Ellen Burstyn), who does not want her daughter to waste her youth as she did. When Lois advises Jacy not to marry Duane and instead sleep with him to learn that there is ""nothing magic about it,"" Jacy is shocked.Then next day, Sonny arrives at Coach's home to pick up Ruth, and the shy woman is disappointed to see that her husband has not come himself. During the return trip, Sonny is nonplussed by Ruth's tears, although she tells him that there is nothing seriously wrong. Afraid to be alone, Ruth invites Sonny in for a soda, but her continuing sobs unsettle him even more, although he timidly tries to comfort her.Another few days later, at the town's annual Christmas dance, Lester Marlow (Randy Quaid), one of Jacy's country club friends, asks her to come to a nude swimming party at the home of wealthy Bobby Sheen (Gary Brockette). Eager for excitement, Jacy consents, then schemes on how to end her date with Duane. Perturbed to see Lois dancing with Abilene (Clu Gulager), the oil driller with whom Lois is having an affair, Jacy lures Duane to the pickup. There, Duane gives Jacy a lavish Christmas present and Jacy, hoping to distract him, places his hand under her skirt before announcing that Lois had ordered her to attend the swimming party with Lester.

She attempts to caution him about his affair with Ruth, which is common knowledge, but Sonny remains silent. Sam and Billy enter, and after Billy joyfully greets his friend, Sam forgives the repentant youth.Another afternoon later on New Year's Eve, Sam takes Sonny and Billy fishing and reminisces about a time 20 years earlier when he brought a young lady friend swimming at the same spot.

Upon their return, however, Abilene treats Jacy coldly, and when she sees her mother, Jacy breaks into tears. As Lois is comforting her, she mentions Ruth and Sonny's relationship, and Jacy, who was unaware of Sonny's liaison, is intrigued, as she knows about Sonny's crush on her.Determined to win Sonny away from Ruth, Jacy begins to date him, and promises that eventually they will spend the night together.

While he is in the hospital, Sonny refuses to see Ruth and Duane joins the US Army.Later, when Sonny returns home, Jacy, who is thrilled to be the center of attention due to the fight over her, tells him they should elope. Eagerly anticipating having sex with Jacy, Sonny acquiesces, but after they are married and are driving home, Jacy reveals that she left a note for her parents detailing their plans. Sonny is crushed when they are stopped by a patrolman and Jacy is driven home by her furious father, who arranges for the marriage to be annulled, but Jacy, who wanted only to heighten her notoriety, is pleased. A resigned Lois drives Sonny back to Anarene, where she reveals that she was the woman with whom Sam had the affair twenty years earlier.Another month or two later in the autumn season, Sonny watches the school football team play and learns that Duane is home on leave. Both dreading and needing to see his friend before he ships out for Korea, Sonny finds Duane and asks if he wants to attend the picture show, as Miss Mosey is being forced to close it due to lack of business. Duane agrees and the boys spend a companionable evening watching the last movie.In the morning, Duane admits that if he had married Jacy, her father would have forced them to get an annulment, too. After Duane leaves on the bus, Sonny is in the pool hall when he hears the screech of brakes in the street and rushes outside to discover that Billy has been hit and killed by a trucker who did not see him, but then drove away from the scene in a hit-and-run. Grief-stricken, Sonny lashes out at the gathered men who deride Billy as a simpleton, then drags his friend's body to the sidewalk, where he carefully covers him.In the final scene, Sonny then drives to Ruth's house, where the surprised woman admits him but then upbraids him for breaking her heart. Although Ruth tells Sonny that he has ruined what was between them, when he tenderly takes one of her hands, she caresses him in return and tells him, ""Never you mind, honey. Never you mind."""

pale, mysterious, red-haired woman already living there. Her name is Emily [Mariclare Costello], and she is simply a drifter using the house because she thought it was abandoned, she tells them. When Emily offers to move on, however, Jessica invites her to have dinner with them and stay the night. Emily happily agrees. After dinner, Emily entertains on her lute while Duncan accompanies on his cello. Then, Emily engages Jessica in a seance to call up any spirits that might have died in the house. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), none show up.One night moves into more nights, and Emily continues to stay. It's becoming obvious that Woody is attracted to her, and Jessica doesn't mind having Emily around, especially because Jessica has begun hearing voices and seeing a blonde girl [Gretchen Corbett] looking at her and then disappearing. Another time, her leg was grabbed by someone under the water in the cove where she was swimming. Jessica is afraid to talk about these things with Duncan or Woody lest they think she's relapsing.Soon, Jessica becomes aware of other problems. 1) Duncan also appears to be attracted to Emily, 2) the men in town, all of whom are bandaged in some way or another, seem to be hostile towards them, and 3) money is tight. To get money for food, Duncan and Jessica decide to sell off some of the antiques they find around the farm. One of the items is a silver-framed portrait of the Bishop family -- father, mother, and daughter Abigail. Sam Dorker [Alan Manson], ex New Yorker and antique dealer, offers them $50 for the frame and tells them the story of how 20-year old Abigail Bishop drowned in 1880 just before her wedding day. Legend says that she's still alive, roving the island as a vampire. Jessica finds the story fascinating, but Duncan just wants to take the money and go home.After returning to the farm, Jessica and Duncan go for a walk around their property. Emily is sitting on the front porch playing her lute, and Woody is out spraying the apple trees. Jessica finds a mole and Duncan offers to take it back to the house and put it in a jar while Jessica stays in the graveyard to do some grave rubbings. She is just about to do a rubbing of Abigail Bishop's grave when she notices the blonde girl beckoning her to follow. The girl leads Jessica to a cliff, at the bottom of which lies Sam Dorker dead and bloodied. By the time Jessica finds Duncan, however, the body is gone. Did she really see it? The look on Duncan's face says that he thinks Jessica is going nuts again. Just then, Jessica notices the blonde girl standing on the cliff above them. Duncan sees her, too, and gives chase. He catches her, but when Jessica tries to ask her questions, the girl is either mute or won't talk. Suddenly, Emily walks up, and the girl runs off.That evening at dinner, it's obvious even to Woody that Duncan and Emily have eyes for each other. When Jessica retires early, Woody tells Duncan to take care of his wife. Reluctantly, Duncan goes up to their bedroom. Instead of taking care of his wife, however, he tells Jessica that she needs to return to New York to see her doctor again. Jessica becomes upset and tells Duncan that she wants to sleep apart tonight, so Duncan goes down to sleep on the couch where he is easily seduced by Emily.The next morning, Jessica finds the little mole has been repeatedly stabbed to death. Jessica denies doing it, but Duncan decides that it's time to get help for her and drives into town in search of a phone. While he's gone, Jessica goes up to the attic where she is surprised to come face to face with the silver-framed portrait of the Bishop family that they had sold just yesterday to Sam Dorker. When she takes a look at the three figures in the portait, she is astounded to see how closely Abigail Bishop resembles Emily. Is it possible they are one and the same?Suddenly, Jessica sees Emily coming up the stairs. Jessica tries to keep her cool while Emily denies that she is Abigail, all the while she is stroking Jessica's feverish face. Finally, out of a desire to get safely out of the attic, Jessica agrees to go with Emily for a cool swim in the lake, even though she's afraid of the water after being grabbed at the other day. As the two women sit at the end of the dock, Emily rubs suntan lotion on Jessica. Suddenly, Emily pushes Jessica into the water and jumps in after her. When Jessica panics, Emily apologizes for scaring her when all she wanted to do was have a little fun. Jessica wades towards shore and looks back to see that Emily has disappeared. She hears Emily's voice in her head and then sees her reddish-hair bobbing to the surface. When a pale white arm grabs her and tries to pull her underwater, Jessica fights to break loose and return to shore. She looks back at the water and watches Emily, pale and dressed in Abigail's wedding gown, rising slowly
from the water and walking towards her, all the while silently saying, ""Stay, Jessica, stay. Follow me.""When Emily reaches Jessica and tries to bite her neck, Jessica's bravado returns. She runs back to the house, locks herself in her room, and waits for Duncan to return. Hours pass, during which Jessica can hear Emily's voice whispering to her. ""I'm still here... I won't go away... you can't get rid of me... I'm in your blood... you want to die."" Come 5 PM and Duncan still hasn't returned, so Jessica changes out of her swimming suit and hitches a ride into town. While Jessica is on her way to town, Woody returns from working the fields to find that the only one at home is Emily. Although Woody doesn't like how Emily has been playing Duncan, he readily submits when she comes on to him. He gets a bite in the neck for his reward.When Jessica gets into town, she sees Duncan's car and asks about his whereabouts, but none of the men will admit to having seen him. Jessica notices that every man has cuts on his body and backs away... straight into the arms of Sam Dorker. Now totally confused about her own sanity, she runs back toward the farm. When she can run no more, she collapses on the ground and lies there until it turns dark and she hears Duncan calling her name. Duncan drives her the rest of the way home, and they go upstairs to bed. As they begin to kiss, Jessica notices a cut on Duncan's neck. Jessica tries to convince herself that it's only in her mind, but then she sees Emily brandishing a carving knife and leading the men from town. Jessica leaps from the bed and runs outside, knocking over Duncan's cello case to see the bloody body of a little girl come tumbling out.Jessica keeps on running. Along the way, she sees Woody's sprayer but when she gets closer, she sees Woody lying on the seat, his neck cut and bloody. She keeps on running. Around daybreak, she makes it to the ferry and tries to board, but the ferryman tells her, ""The ferry isn't running for you."" Jessica jumps into a nearby rowboat and begins paddling out into the lake. Suddenly she sees a hand reach into the boat from the water. She stabs the person in the back several times with a long pick. As the body floats away, pale and bloody, she sees that it is Duncan. Back on the shore, Emily/Abigail and the men from town can be seen watching her.""I sit here, and I can't believe that it happened,"" Jessica says to herself, ""and yet I have to believe it. Nightmares or dreams? Madness or sanity? I don't know which is which."" [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

tt0067361,"['Mystery', 'Thriller']","London, England. Carol Hammond (Florinda Bolkan) is the daughter of a wealthy lawyer and politician named Edmund Brighton (Leo Genn). Her husband Frank (Jean Sorel) is a lawyer working for Brighton's practice. They all live together in a large apartment with Joan (Edy Gall), Frank's teenage daughter from a previous marriage. Carol has been visiting a psychoanalyst (George Rigaud) because of a string of disturbing dreams shes been having featuring her decadent neighbor, Julia Durer (Anita Strindberg). Julia's frequent, late-night parties infuriate and yet exite Carol, evoking images of wild sex-and-drug orgies.During a meeting between Edmund and Frank, they talk about their recent court cases in which Edmund asks Frank if he has been unfaithful to Carol, which Frank denies. Then a phone call is made by an anonymous woman who claims to Edmund that she has damaging information about his family. But unknown to everyone, Frank is indeed having an affair with his personal secretary Deborah whom he meets after work at her country house for some romantic tryst.Carol's dreams continue which become more complicated during scenes that appear to be dreams or hallucinations, but may be partly real. Describing her latest one to her psychoanalyst, they depict a lesbian encounter between the two women, culminating in Carol grisly stabbing the seductive Julia to death. In an enigmatic coda to the dream sequence, Carol sees two kaftan-clad hippies (Mike Kennedy and Penny Brown) who have apparently witnessed the whole thing without intervening.The following day, it's revealed that Julia Durer has indeed been murdered. Inspector Corvin (Stanley Baker) from Scotland Yard arrives to take charge of the investigation. The room and condition of the dead body are identical to their depiction in the dream sequence. To make matters even more incriminating, there is a discarded fur coat near the body. Learning of the murder, Carol insists that she see the scene of the crime and when she enters Julia's apartment and sees the body, she faints.After weeding out a false and self-serving confession from a delirious regular at the Durer parties, Corvin focuses on Carol Hammond. In the meanwhile, Carol, during a shopping excursion with her step-daughter Joan, see the two hippies from her dream sequence. Following them to an abandoned theater where other hippies hang out, Joan asks them if they know Carol or have ever seen her before. Neither the hippy man or woman claim that they haven't.As the evidence against Carol mounts, the police surreptitiously obtain her fingerprints, which match those found on the murder weapon, and Carol is soon arrested and charged with murdering Julia. However, doubts begin to circulate with Corvin as he wonders if she is the killer, why was she describing the murder to her psychananalyst in detail before it actually took place? Could it be that someone has read her dream diary that she kept and modeled the killing on dream images she described in order to frame her for something she fantasized about? Corvin also wonders if Carol is the killer, who are the two hippies she claims to have witnessed her crime without intervening?As Carol is awaiting trial in the grounds of a maximum security sanitorium, she sees one of the hippies break in and chase her through the grounds. Carol flees into the building and in trying to hide she enters a room containing a hideous experiment: four live dogs, claimed in an upright position, whimper helplessly, their abdomens sliced open and pinned with surgical clamps exposing their glistening innards and still beating hearts. Carol faints in horror. When she comes around, there is no trace of the threatening man. The sanitorium director thinks that Carols ramblings about the intruder, and the disemboweled dogs, must have been another one of her elaborate hallucinations.Meanwhile, Carol's father swings into overdrive with her case and manages to elaborate a suspicion that appeals to the police. Edmund Brighton discovers Frank's affair with Deborah and that Julia Durer had been blackmailing him for money as not to expose his extramarital affair. Brighton's argument is enough to get Carol released on bail, but Frank remains free and desperately tries to prove his innocence.While relaxing at Brighton's country estate, Carol is contacted by the hippy woman and agrees to meet with them at a secret rendezvous, at the Alexandra Palace in North London. Once there, Carol is attacked by the hippy man in the cellar and chased through the building where she gets attacked by bats in the attic and gets brutally stabbed as the hippy catches up to her on the rooftop. But Carol is rescued by the police, forcing the hippy man to flee.Another red herring emerges when Joan meets with the hippy woman concerning her stepmother's well being and agreeing to meet. The next day, Joan is found murdered in a field with her throat cut. Inspector Corvin meets with Carol recovering at her father's estate to ask about the hippie couple and of the blackmail that Julia Durer may have been planning for Frank.Corvin finally tracks down and arrests the hippie couple, Hubert and Jenny, whom he takes to the scene of the crime to interrogate them about the Durer murder. Although Hubert admits to have stalked Carol and murdered Joan, they protest their innocence claiming not to remember anything about that night except for recalling ""a lizard in a womans skin."" Then a phone call comes informing the police that Brighton has been found dead at his estate, the victim of a suicide, and leaving behind a note confessing to the murder of Julia Durer which seems to wrap up the case.A few days later, Carol is at her father's grave when Corvin arrives to offer his condolences to her. When Corvin asks Carol about the phone call that her father got from Julia Durer which Carol admits that she knew about, he asks how did she know that Julia Durer phoned Mr. Brighton on the day before she was murdered since he never told anybody about it. Too late to realize her slip, Corvin deduces Carol's guilt as she was with Julia Durer during that day the phone call was made.As it turns out, Carol Hammond really did kill Julia Durer after she threatened to go public with their lesbian relationship they've been having for several months. Carol did break into Julia's apartment and stabbed her to death, only to realize that two hippies saw her, which made her panic and leave the scene of the crime. Carol had felt certain that the two hippies would describe her to the police. The murderous, but perfectly sane, Carol entered the event in her dream diary immediately afterwards so by combining details of the murder with images from the recurring nightmares for which she had sought treatment, she hopped to avoid a murder sentence and get off with guilt by temporary insanity that the dream diary would provide plausible evidence in court of a split personality. But Carol did not realize that both hippies where high on LSD and unable to register the significance of what they saw that night. Carol is then led away by Inspector Corvin from her father's grave to a waiting police car."

tt0067525,"['Action', 'Drama', 'SciFi', 'Thriller']","A science fiction thriller based on the 1954 novel ""I am Legend"" by Richard Matheson.Set in 1977, two years after biological warfare wiped out the entire world population, except for Robert Neville (Charlton Heston) and a few that have been mutated into light-sensitive flesh-eating psychopathic zombies who are partially blind. Convinced by their fanatic leader, former news broadcaster Matthias (Anthony Zerbe), that Neville personifies the twin evils of science and militarism. Neville remains safely barricaded in his elegant, downtown penthouse apartment, where he has hoarded food, liquor and fuel normalcy in spite of the catastrophe around him, Neville patrols the city by day, carrying a machine gun and recording any sign of the mutants' activity in hopes of finding and destroying them. After another evening of fighting off attacks led by Matthias and his cohort Zachary, Neville searches downtown in hope of tracking them down. Attempting to suppress his constant anxiety, Neville ""shops"" in a clothing store and is startled when he sees a young black woman attempting to blend in with the store mannequins. Neville chases the woman, but she escapes by running into a park. Exhausted, Neville trudges into a bar and hearing a noise, descends into the darkened wine cellar where he is attacked by a group of mutants who take him to Matthias. Matthias condemns Neville for not being one of his ""family"" because he is not infected and declares him ""obsolete"". Neville maintains that the mutants should organize and attempt to find a cure, but Matthias and the others declare Neville guilty and carry him outside to a cart where he is driven to an area just outside of the stadium. Lashing Neville to a tree, Matthias exhorts his followers to burn the scientist as the bodies of the the dead were burned after initial contamination. Suddenly the stadium lights come one, forcing the mutants to collapse in an effort to cover their sensitive eyes and skin. An unmutated young man appears and cuts Neville free, then guides him away to the tunnels under the stadium where they are joined by the young woman Neville saw in the store. The woman forces Neville at gunpoint to drive her on a motorbike through the stadium and away from the recovering mutants.At dawn, the couple arrives at a house at the base of the mountains where Neville is stunned to meet a few healthy children. The young man joins the group and introduces himself as Dutch and the woman as Lisa. Dutch tells Neville that he is familiar with his work, as he was a graduate student in biochemistry before the disaster. Dutch explains that neither he nor Lisa and the children understand why they have not been afflicted with the plague, but admits that most of them have a mild sensitivity to light. Lisa and Dutch then tell Neville that they have brought him to examine one of the young people, Richie, who has shown signs of plague. After examining the boy, Neville shocks Lisa and Dutch when he reveals that he is immune to the plague due to a vaccination he developed and took just as the war reached its peak. Heartened when Neville suggests that his blood could be used to make a serum, Dutch and Lisa agrees to let Neville take Richie back to town where Neville has access to laboratories. At Neville's penthouse, he administers the last remaining vaccination to Richie. That evening, Neville treats Lisa to Dinner, but they are interrupted by a power outage caused Neville's failure to refuel the generators. While Neville goes to the basement to restore power, Zachary scales the building to the penthouse balcony. Neville restores the lights and returns in time to kill Zachary just as he is about to attack Lisa. Neville and Lisa spend the night together and the next morning, Neville notes that Richie's condition is much improved. Taking Lisa to a laboratory, Neville draws his own blood and sets about making a serum he hopes will work. Pleased, Lisa offers to spend the afternoon gathering supplies for them and Neville returns to his penthouse to find a nearly-recovered Richie. When Neville tells Richie about the serum, the boy expresses happiness that everyone will soon ""return to normal"". Neville explains that the mutants may be too far along in the illness to be saved and should be left dying. Dismayed, Richie criticizes the scientist for his hypocrisy and abruptly reveals that mutants hideout is the city civic center.Later, Neville goes to the mountains to report Richie's recovery and the serum development to Dutch, who agrees to join Neville and Lisa the following day. Upon returning to town, Neville finds a note from Richie declaring he has gone to confront the mutants to find out if they are as cynical as Neville. The scientist hurries to the civic center where he finds Richie brutally murdered. At dusk, as Lisa returns to the penthouse she runs into a torchlight parade by the mutants and, showing signs of the illness, joins them and lets them in at Neville apartment. Back at the penthouse, Neville is confronted by Matthias, a dazed Lisa and several mutants who destroy his belongings. Neville succeeds in breaking free and, using a large knife, threatens Matthias. Grabbing Lisa, Neville flees outside, but when Matthias calls to Lisa from the balcony, she is confused and breaks away from Neville. As Neville's machine gun jams, Matthias sees the spear dropped by Zachary and hurls it at Neville, impaling in him in the chest. The following morning, Dutch arrives with the children and is horrified to find Neville bleeding to death. Before dying, Neville gives Dutch the serum bottle and urges him to take the collapsed Lisa and the children away to start anew."

With silent efficiency, they kidnap factory manager John Bishop (Johnny Haymer), knock out guard George Morgan, and force Bishop to open the office vault, wherein lies their target: $4 million worth of heroin. Upon leaving, they blow up the building gate.Soon after, detective Lt. Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) and his partner, Lt. Jack Pecora (Gerald S. O'Loughlin), are called in to investigate and find Bishop dead at his desk. Tibbs begins by questioning Morgan, who was knocked out, about why the robbers would have blown up the gate when they could have made their escape without opening the gate. Assistant manager William Martin (Graham Jarvis) is also questioned, but has no idea why anyone would have killed Bishop, who has no obvious enemies.Upon returning to their office, the police learn that Bishop was shot with two guns, execution-style; that the robbers entered from outside a window five stories high; and that they had only four minutes after tripping the alarms to exit the building. Meanwhile, corporate executives Bob Alford (Fred Beir) and Zach Mills (John Lasell), the leaders of the drug syndicate that supplied Bishop with the heroin, speak to their colleagues in Istanbul and Paris. Using code, they inform them that the heroin has been stolen and Bishop killed.At home that night, Tibbs is bantering with his wife Valerie (Barbara McNair) and their children, Andy and Ginny, when he receives an anonymous phone call asking him to walk alone along a city street at a certain hour. Instructing Pecora to come after him in 30 minutes, Tibbs does as he is told and is soon ushered into an apartment where the robbers have gathered. Leader Juan Mendoza (Raul Julia) introduces Rev. Dave Thomas (Billy 'Green' Bush), Annie Sekido, Charlie Blossom, Stacy Baker and Joe Peralez, who admit they robbed the factory but insist that they did not murder Bishop. The vigilante group, each member of which has lost a loved one to drug addiction or overdose, wants to destroy ""the organization."" When they ask for Tibbs's help, pointing out that they deliberately blew up the gate in order to tip off the authorities, he refuses, stating that he cannot risk his career by banding with criminals without the knowledge of the police force. When he returns to Pecora, however, Tibbs says nothing about the group.That night, narcotics captain Grayson shoots himself, causing the men in the station to assume he was corrupt. After Bishop's wife lies to the police that she drove her husband to the factory the night of his murder, Tibbs realizes that she is being pressured not to admit that he was kidnapped. He arranges to meet Dave, Annie and Juan on a ferry, where he reluctantly acknowledges that they are not the killers and agrees to work with them, as long as they do not make a move without his approval.Tibbs re-questions Morgan, and when the guard refuses to admit that another car came in after the robbers broke in, Tibbs takes him in for further questioning. On way to the station, however, a car drives by and the passenger shoots Morgan, killing him before he can talk.Back at the station, Pecora wonders why Tibbs did not take him along to interrogate Morgan, but Tibbs deflects his questions and visits Morgan's widow Gloria to question her. She reveals that Morgan was rich, suggesting that Bishop was paying him off.Later, two toughs beat up Joe and offer him half a million dollars to meet them at Washington Square with information about where the heroin is hidden. Joe tells Juan, who urges him to meet the thugs in order to glean more information about them.Meanwhile, Pecora suggests that Tibbs call in the narcotics squad to help with the case, but Tibbs manages to hold him off. Joe goes to the designated meeting place and, while Juan and Annie watch nervously, a car arrives and takes him away. He shows the thugs a sample of the heroin and asks for $5 million, and in response, they threaten his life and order him to meet them that night. Annie, fearful for her friends, informs Tibbs, who instructs her to convince them that they must include him in their dealings, for their own safety. They arrange for Annie to call the station and anonymously tip off Pecora to the meeting point that night. As she hangs up the phone, however, the thugs follow her, and despite her efforts to elude them, they trap her in her car. Meanwhile, Jessop, the head of the narcotics division, assigns four men to help Tibbs and Pecora that night.The undercover police tail Joe, but when no one shows up at the meeting place, Tibbs is excoriated for wasting their time. Soon, Tibbs hears that Annie's dead body has been found, and meets the remaining five men to tell them that, because Annie was tortured to inform on them, they have been exposed and must flee. Tibbs and Pecora then question Martin again and, upon running through the complex alarm system with him, deduce that the murderers must have had an outside accomplice.Soon after, Tibbs learns from Dave that Joe's apartment is being watched by the thugs, and Tibbs rushes there, arriving just as the thugs run over Joe with their car. Although Tibbs arrests one of the men, the severely injured Joe blames the policeman for failing to protect him. When Jessop arrives at the hospital to question Joe, he learns of Tibbs's involvement, and soon Tibbs is called in to his superior, Capt. Stacy, and suspended for withholding information from the department. As Tibbs leaves, Jessop caustically informs him that Grayson killed himself not because he was corrupt but because he was dying of leukemia. Tibbs, unwilling to abandon the surviving vigilantes, asks his friend, the lawyer Sgt. Leo Chassman, for help in investigating Century. Chassman learns that the company has myriad ""dummy"" corporations as stockholders, and informs Tibbs about its complex financial workings.Meanwhile, Juan calls his friend Benjy, a small-time dealer, and offers to exchange the heroin for half a million dollars, on a crowded street. As Juan has hoped, Benjy arranges for the transfer with Alford and Mills, who arrive on the street to supervise the transaction. Just as Benjy and Juan swap bags, Charlie grabs the bag of heroin and runs off. While Tibbs's men, whom Juan has informed about the meeting, arrest Benjy, the organization's men chase Charlie into the unfinished subway system, followed by Tibbs. Together, Charlie and Tibbs shoot some of the thugs, and when the police arrive to finish the job, Tibbs runs off so they will not know he has been involved. He goes to Gloria's house and there casually reveals that he knows, based on the fact that Chassman's research has revealed that she is a major, wealthy stockholder in Century, who worked as a drug runner for the organization and facilitated Bishop's murder by tripping the alarms for the killers.After letting Pecora into the house, Tibbs advises Gloria to identify her bosses before they kill her, then uncovers a stash of heroin hidden inside a cut of beef in her refrigerator. Trapped, Gloria admits that Alford and Mills were behind the murder. The two men are arrested, but as they are being transported to testify, a sniper shoots them both before they can talk. Realizing that the organization will continue its dirty dealings, the reinstated Tibbs accepts a ride home from Pecora."

In an apartment used by several addicts, Helen witnesses the intricate ritual of ""shooting up"" or preparing and injecting the heroin into a vein, and listens to their discussion of the price and availability of drugs. On the street, Bobby becomes anxious when drugs he has paid for are not in the telephone booth where he is to pick them up. After tracking down the man who sold him the drugs, he is re-directed to look into a trash can. That night his drug-taking renders him unable to make love to Helen.When they are evicted for non-payment of rent, Bobby suggests to Helen that she return home, but she refuses and they move into a sleazier apartment. After Bobby asks her to deliver money to Freddy, one of his suppliers, Helen realizes Bobby has not given her enough money to pay for the drugs and that she will be expected to make up the difference by having sex. While Helen is negotiating with Freddy, Hotch, a policeman on the drug squad, and his partner arrest them. As his partner convinces Freddy to assist them in a sting, Hotch explains to Helen about what it's like when there is a ""panic."" He explains that when the drug supply on the street is low, everyone begins to turn one another into the police, in return for favors. Unexpectedly, Hotch releases Helen without booking her and she returns to Bobby, who begins to use drugs more heavily. While Bobby spends more time sleeping, Helen, who all along has only observed the others, begins to shoot up.Some time later, Bobby is exuberantly playing stick ball with some children, when he passionately kisses Helen and looking into her eyes, realizes she is now using. In his favorite diner, as the drugged Helen sits listlessly beside him, Bobby proposes. Upon hearing the news, Hank asks what they will live on and doubts Bobby's supposition that he can quit drugs. Hank offers Bobby work as a burglar, but Helen rejects the idea, saying instead that she will get a job. However, Helen who has been hired as a waitress, does a terrible job and soon quits. Just before Bobby is to assist Hank in a burglary, he overdoses. With the aid of other users, Helen finds Bobby and helps him through the ordeal, but Hank is angry with Bobby for jeopardizing his plans. Reluctantly, he allows Bobby to assist him on another night, but the theft goes awry and Bobby is arrested. While he is in jail, Helen finds it harder to get drugs and has sex with Hank, in exchange for heroin.When Bobby is released, he and Helen have a big fight, after which Bobby considers moving to the country, but they agree that it is not feasible. Bobby persuades Santo, a major drug dealer, to let him handle distribution in Needle Park, and is directed to an apartment where the heroin is being prepared and bagged. Meanwhile, as they are in need of immediate money, Helen turns to streetwalking. After Bobby distributes Santo's drugs, Needle Park residents are happy to have a reliable source for a while. Bobby tells Helen that he stashed some drugs away as an insurance in case he is arrested, so that he can pay for a lawyer. However, when he finds the drugs missing from his hiding place, he accuses Helen of stealing it. As her health deteriorates from increasing drug use, their relationship suffers. Hotch, who is not surprised to watch her fall from an innocent woman in love to a drug abusing prostitute, keeps an eye on her and, when she is arrested with her john, he asks the arresting officer not to book her, as he needs her for something he is planning.When her mother writes, asking Helen to meet friends who are visiting the city, Helen is reluctant, but dresses up, carefully trying to hide the track marks on her arms. Instead of meeting them, however, she picks up a young virginal customer. When Bobby finds her, he scares the boy away, but then he and Helen begin to laugh. Realizing they have been too serious, they take the ferry to the countryside, where they buy a puppy. On the return trip, they discuss making a fresh start and Helen suggests that they move out of Needle Park, but Bobby refuses and convinces her to go into the men's room to shoot up. When the dog begins to whine, he puts it outside the door. Afterward, Helen discovers the dog missing and finds it just before it falls off the end of the ferry and into its machinery.Desolate, she goes to see Marco, who is back from his trip, but soon returns to Bobby and steals drugs from him. Needing a ""fix,"" she goes to a doctor, falsely claiming she needs drugs for a painful kidney stone. Aware that she is an abuser, the doctor refuses to write a prescription for her, but gives her some samples, telling her never to return. She takes some of the pills, but is arrested for selling the rest to minors. Hotch warns her about the dangers of the women's prison and knowing that Bobby can lead them to Santo, offers to arrange for the charges to be dropped if she will help them to catch Bobby in the act of picking up a drug shipment. When she refuses, Hotch explains that she will go to jail for one to three years, but Bobby, who knows how to work the system, will probably only serve six months. Later, at home, Bobby elatedly tells her that there will be no more ""panic"" after the new shipment arrives, saying that Santo is giving him as much as he can sell, and is allowing him to have people work under him.In the next two weeks, Hotch approaches Helen several times, reminding her of the pending trial. Depressed, she increases her drug use and spends days in bed, until even Bobby is annoyed. Helen finally agrees to help the police and late one night Helen and Hotch watch, as a squad of policemen apprehend Bobby, who is in possession of a large quantity of heroin. Spotting her on the street and feeling betrayed, Bobby yells, ""I was gonna marry you!"" Months later, when he is released, Helen waits for him at the gate. Although his first impulse is to rebuff her, he calls to her and they walk off together.[4]"

Seeing an attractive woman (Jessica Walter) sitting at the end of the bar, Dave and Murphy play a nonsensical board game to get her attention. Her curiosity piqued, the woman comes over and introduces herself as Evelyn Draper. Evelyn laughs when Dave reveals his ploy, and they go to her home, where she confesses that she came to the bar to meet him. Dave then recognizes her voice and realizes that she is the fan who calls him every night with the request ""play 'Misty' for me."" Although Dave warns Evelyn that he is ""hung up"" on another woman, she is unconcerned and spends the night with him, with the stipulation that they will not ""complicate"" each other's lives.The next day, Dave is working at home when Al drops by, but they are interrupted by the appearance of Evelyn, who is carrying groceries. Assuming that Dave had a date with Evelyn, Al leaves, although a nonplussed Dave admonishes her for arriving so unexpectedly. Evelyn is cheered when Dave mentions that she should call ""next time,"" however, and he lets her stay the night.Later, while driving through Carmel, Dave learns that artist Tobie Williams (Donna Mills), his former girl friend who left town four months earlier, has returned. Dave insists on talking with Tobie, and she explains that she could no longer endure waiting for him every night, wondering if he was with another woman. Dave assures her that he has been attempting to change, and states that although her series of eccentric roommates at her isolated Carmel Highlands home irritated him, he wants to resume their relationship. Tobie agrees to consider his proposal but cautions him that she needs time.A little later, Dave is at The Sardine Factory having a drink when Evelyn calls looking for him. Dave signals Murphy to tell her that he is not there, but when Dave leaves, he finds Evelyn waiting in the parking lot having followed him and made the call from a nearby payphone. Again made uneasy by Evelyn's bizarre behavior, Dave refuses to take her out, although in a few days, she again shows up at his house without phoning first. Dave is forced to let her in when she takes off her coat, revealing that she is naked, and once inside, she seduces Dave again. As she leaves the next day, she invites him to her house for dinner, but he replies that he will call her. Dave then goes to work, where he makes a demonstration tape for Madge Brenner (Irene Hervey), an influential radio-station owner who is interested in hiring Dave for a prominent San Francisco job.A few days later, Evelyn calls Dave to chide him for forgetting their date, and an irritated Dave soon arrives, determined to tell her that their relationship is over. Dave becomes infuriated as Evelyn sobs that she loves him, then screams violently at him as he leaves. When Dave returns home, Evelyn calls, begging him to forgive her, but he hangs up on her. Later, Dave spends more time with Tobie, and the increasingly forgiving Tobie makes plans to go to a party with him the following evening.That night, however, an hysterical Evelyn arrives at Dave's, waking him because she believes that Tobie is with him. Surprised to find him alone, Evelyn calms down, but when Dave demands that she leave, Evelyn goes into the bathroom and slashes her wrists. Dave calls a friend, Dr. Frank Dewan (Jack Ging), to tend to Evelyn, who has not been seriously injured, and Frank reluctantly agrees not to notify the police. Evelyn overhears as Frank cautions Dave to keep her calm, and easily manipulates Dave to let her stay by making him feel guilty.The next evening, when Dave attempts to leave to see Tobie, Evelyn pretends to have a nightmare, and Dave is forced to stay with her, thereby standing up Tobie. In the morning, Dave's feisty maid, Birdie (Clarice Taylor), finds him asleep on the couch. Evelyn has taken Dave's car into town to buy groceries, and while she is out, she secretly has a copy of Dave's house key made.Meanwhile, Dave receives a call from Madge, who wants to have lunch with him and discuss the new job. When Evelyn returns to Dave's, he explains that he is on his way to a business luncheon. As Dave and Madge are eating, however, an irate Evelyn arrives and hurls insults at Madge. Dave drags her out of the restaurant into a waiting cab, but when he returns, he finds that Madge has departed.Dave then goes to Tobie's and confesses his situation to her. While Dave is gone, Birdie returns to his house and discovers that Evelyn has destroyed the furnishings and is in the process of cutting up Dave's clothes. Surprised by Birdie's appearance, Evelyn slashes her repeatedly with a knife. Dave arrives as Birdie is being taken away in an ambulance, and the police, led by Sgt. McCallum, are questioning Evelyn. McCallum is irritated by Dave's lack of knowledge about Evelyn, but assures him that she will receive psychiatric help.As time passes, Dave and Tobie reconcile, and months later, attend the Monterey Jazz Festival, where Tobie mentions that a new roommate, Annabel, will be moving in with her. That night, Evelyn calls Dave as he is working, and, explaining that she has been released from the sanatorium, tells him that she is in San Francisco, on her way to Hawaii. She asks him to play ""Misty"" for her, which he does, but later that night, he wakes up to hear the song playing in his bedroom. Dave moves just as Evelyn attempts to stab him with a butcher knife, and she escapes before he can catch her.Shaken, Dave calls McCallum, who reveals that Evelyn had been released pending further legal action. McCallum presses Dave to remember Evelyn's exact words when she called him, especially the line of a poem that she quoted. Dave then warns Tobie that Evelyn has returned, and the next night, although Dave would rather be guarding Tobie, McCallum instructs him to stay at work, so that the police can trace the call if Evelyn telephones him.In order to reassure Dave, McCallum drives to Tobie's house to check on her, and after he leaves, Dave remembers that the poem Evelyn quoted was Edgar Allan Poe's ""Annabel Lee."" Realizing that Evelyn must be Annabel, Tobie's new roommate, Dave puts on a pre-recorded tape of one of his old shows and rushes to her home. By the time Dave arrives, however, Evelyn has murdered McCallum by stabbing him with a pair of scissors and bound and gagged the terrified Tobie, and has cut off some of her hair with the scissors. As Dave attempts to free Tobie, Evelyn jumps out of the darkness and attacks him with a knife, slashing him repeatedly. Although wounded, Dave succeeds in fending her off before she disappears. Dave searches the house for Evelyn, and when she attacks him again, she stabs him several times in his arms and left leg until he finally manages to punch Evelyn in the face with such tremendous force that it knocks Evelyn back through the back glass door and over the balcony railing and over the cliff, sending her falling to her death in the ocean below. As the wounded and bloodied Dave frees Tobie and they stagger from the house together, the pre-recorded tape plays Dave's dedication of ""Misty"" to Evelyn one last time."

tt0067656,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","At a remote mansion overlooking a vast, empty bay lake, Countess Federica (Isa Miranda), wheels herself through her dark, empty house. She sorrowfully looks out her window at the rain when Filippo Donati (Giovanni Nuvoletti), her husband, appears and murders her by wrapping a noose around her neck and kicks her out of her wheelchair. The countess cannot stand on or move her useless legs and is strangled to death. But then Filippo is then murdered by a unseen killer who jumps out at him from behind a curtain, and drags his body away. The presence of a suicide note, stolen from the countess' diary, leads the police to believe that she has killed herself.Several days later, Frank Ventura (Chris Avram), a real estate agent, and his secretary/lover Laura (Anna Maria Rosati) are in bed discussing their plans to take over Countess Federicas property following her murder. They both realized the bay's potential to fetch a large price on the estate market, and they are the ones who have convinced Donati to murder his wife. All that Ventura needs to take control of the bay is Donati's signature on some paperwork, although he does not realize that Donati too has been murdered. Ventura plans to go to his cottage, which adjoins the desired property, to meet with Donati. Laura, jealous of Ventura's obsession with the property, asks to come along. When he tells her to stay put, she complains that he enjoys making her life miserable. Ventura tells Laura about a 'squonk' which is mystical creature who is crafty, but never stops whimpering. Laura understands the analogy and agrees to be patient.Back at the bay, Paolo Foscari (Leopoldo Trieste), an entomologist who owns a small house on the grounds, is hard at work trying to capture an insect. He runs into Simon (Claudio Volonte), a handyman who also lives on the property and makes a living by catching squid in the bay. During their conversation, Foscari suggests that the countess might have been murdered. Very defensively, Simon replies that the police ruled it a suicide. Foscari sarcastically replies that it was a suicide before running off to catch more insects.Meanwhile, four rowdy teenagers, Brunhilda (Brigette Skay), Denise (Paola Rubens), Duke (Guido Boccaccini), and Robert (Roberto Bonanni), arrive at the bay for a day of partying and fun. The trouble-making teens break into Ventura's vacant cottage to steal some liquor and smoke some dope. While Denise and Duke retreat to a nearby bedroom for sex, Robert, makes a fire in the fireplace, while Brunhilda goes swimming in the bay. There, she accidentally discovers the badly decomposed body of Filippo Donati floating under water. In a panic state, she runs out of the water, quickly dresses, and runs back to the cottage to tell the others of her find, only to get chased and attacked by a unseen maniac wielding a large billhook, who catches up to her and slashes her throat. Robert is next when he opens the front door of the cottage after hearing a noise and is whacked in the face with the same billhook. The unseen killer takes a fisherman's spear, and kills both Denise and Duke by impaling them in bed while they are in the middle of sex.As night falls on the bay, Renata (Claudine Auger), Donati's estranged daughter, arrives in a mobile home with her weak-willed husband Albert (Luigi Pistilli), hoping to lay claim to the bay estate. Leaving their two young children asleep in their camper, the couple pay a visit to Foscari and his wife Anna (Laura Betti), a fortune teller and tarot reader with a very supercilious nature. Sitting down for tea, Anna slyly insinuates that the countess' death was probably Renata's father's doing, and that Simon may be the one to inherit the property. Shocked to discover that she has a half-brother, Renata leaves with Albert who tells him that Simon will have to be disposed of.Renata and Albert meet with Simon to talk with him about the countess' death when they discover the badly decomposed body of Donati's in Simon's boat. Simon claims to have only found the body floating in the bay and will inform the authorities. Renata and Albert flee to stop at Venturas cottage hoping to meet with him, but find it apparently deserted. When Albert walks away for a moment, Ventura suddenly appears and attempts to kill Renata. She runs into the bathroom where she discovers the four mutilated, dead bodies of the teenagers. But Renata gets the upper hand by grabbing a pair of scissors, and stabbing Ventura. This is accidently witnessed by Foscari, and when he runs back to his house to call the police, Albert follows him there and strangles him to death. When Anna, hearing the commotion at Ventura's cottage, arrives there and gets decapitated by Renata weilding an rafting axe. Frightened by the aura of violence around him and disgusted with himself for killing an innocent man, Albert tries to persuade Renata to make a run for it. But the murderous Renata tells Albert that she has no intention of giving up when she's so close to inheriting the bay. She also reminds Albert that they still have to kill Simon.Things gets more complicated when Laura shows up at the bay looking for Ventura, when she stumbles into Simon's shack on the bay where he appears and threatens her with a machete. It is revealed by Simon that Ventura hired him to murder Filippo Donati with the promise that Ventura will give him his share of the property and money to leave the country. Simon really is the countess illegitimate son who was supported by his mother all this time and the one who murdered the four teenager after one of them discovered the body of Donati since he was ordered by Ventura not to let Donati's death be made public knowledge until after Simon inherits the bay. Furious at Laura when he finds out that she and Ventura were responsible for Donati murdering his mother, he attempt to kill her too. But at first Laura gets the upper hand by throwing a pot of boiling water on Simon, scalding his face. But he quickly recovers and strangles her with his bare hands.Simon then goes after both Renata and Albert hiding out in the property. But then Albert turns the tables on Simon by impaling him to a wall with the same fisherman's spear Simon used to kill two of the teens. With Simon finally taken care of, Renata and Albert search the countess' house for the missing will which has the listings of beneficiaries. But then Ventura, who was presumed to be dead, shows up and attempts to kill both of them, but is then dealt with by Albert who kills him for good.The next morning, with all the loose ends tied up and the countess will burned, Renata and Albert plan to return home to wait for news of her inheritance of the bay. But in an ironic twist, both Renata and Albert are shot to death by the very own neglected children, who playfully point a loaded shotgun at their parents and shoot them both down. The little girl says to her brother, ""Gee, they sure are good at playing dead, aren't they?"" The sister and brother then run out of the camper to playfully skip some stones by the water."

He last saw her 40 years ago when he was but a young bellboy, and she hasn't changed a bit. It is winter, and the only other hotel guests are a newlywed couple, Stefan (John Karlen) and Valerie (Danielle Ouimet) Chilton, who are en route from Switzerland to England, where Stefan's mother lives. Elizabeth comments to Ilona that Stefan and Valerie are perfect, and they take the adjoining suite. Stefan is having a hard time telling his mother about his marriage. He makes one excuse after another when pressed by Valerie, even going so far as to ask Pierre, in front of Valerie, to put through a call to his mother while slipping Pierre a note that says, ""Say there is no reply."" Stefan is not anxious to get back to England and finds reason to hang around Ostend for another day or two or three.No one can go to Belgium without visiting Brugge, walking among its medieval buildings and taking a boat ride on its many canals.

In the tussle that follows, Ilona drops the razor and then falls on top of it, killing herself instantly. Just at that moment, Elizabeth and Valerie walk in the bathroom to find their naked bodies lying on the floor. Valerie has given up loving Stefan.

Fortunately, Valerie still cares enough to grab Stefan's hand and pull him out.Unknown to Stefan, Elizabeth has also been seducing Valerie with her kisses. When the three of them return to the hotel, Valerie chooses Elizabeth over Stefan. Now it's Stefan's turn to be jealous.

His friend, Paul, is a novelist who works as a house painter to make ends meet. When the financially strapped Pierre pursues a paying assignment from Swiss television to write a script about a shooting incident several years back, he enlists Paul's help to complete everything in the needed one-month time frame. The incident offers some intrigue: a man is shot while cleaning his army rifle. He says his delinquent niece, Rosemonde, shot him, while she claims he accidentally shot himself. The truth is never determined and Rosemonde is not charged.
Pierre pursues the assignment like a journalist, reviewing the shooting scene and interviewing the uncle, the niece's former employers and friends, and eventually Rosemonde herself. Paul recreates the incident, applying his imagination alone to construct the details of the plot and the players while continuing at home with his poet wife and young daughter. They plan to work independently and pool their material to create the final script. Uncannily, Paul intuits a lot of the details of events and persons correctly without knowing the facts, while we observe Pierre running the facts down. He develops a relationship with Rosemonde, who enters his life and his bed. Paul meets Rosemonde at Pierre's and also falls under her spell. He concocts a tale in which he appears to tell his wife he has been unfaithful and she responds by quoting a passage from Handke that speaks to a future where people will be free to live and love as they like without hurting each other.
Meeting the actual Rosemonde destroys Paul's ability to work on her story, while Pierre has only his notes to fall back on. The deadline passes, they cannot deliver the script, and they have already spent the fee, defraying old debts and helping Rosemonde. Officialdom imposes as an inspector arrives to evaluate the contents of Pierre's apartment since the rent has not been paid for months. Pierre faces poverty and eviction and decides to relocate to Paris while Paul returns to house painting, but their friendship continues strong. We watch Rosemonde defy her petit bourgeois bosses, first leaving her sausage factory job and subsequently getting herself fired from a shoe shop after she is implicated in a burglary there. She walks away smiling into the Christmas shopping crowds. At least for these few minutes, she is free."

Vic Androzzi meets Shaft and unsuccessfully tries to get information from him on the two gangsters. After Androzzi leaves, Shaft spots one of the men waiting for him in his office building. He commandeers the first gangster, forcing him into his office where the second gangster is waiting. After a quick fight, Shaft dodges one of them who goes out the window, while the other surrenders and reveals to him that Bumpy Jonas, the leader of a Harlem-based organized crime family, wanted Shaft brought uptown to Harlem for a meeting.At the police station, Shaft lies to Lt.

It turns out Bumpy's daughter has been kidnapped, and Shaft is asked to ensure her safe return.After tracking down Ben Buford as Bumpy suggested, a big shoot out ensues; Shaft is told by Vic after the shooting that Shaft himself, and not Ben, was the target, and that tensions brewing between the uptown hoods belonging to Bumpy Jonas and the downtown Mafiosi have culminated in a couple of murders. But the perception is black against white to the general public, with the possibility of an escalation into full-blown race war on the streets of the city.

tt0067756,"['Drama', 'SciFi']","Silent Running takes place in the not-so-distant future, at a time in which Earth's plant life has been decimated. Only a few specimens of flora have been preserved, and are currently in space in a fleet of orbiting greenhouses.Freeman Lowell (played by Bruce Dern) is the main character, one of four extraterrestrial forest rangers aboard the Valley Forge, one of the 2,000 metre-long green house freighters. He is passionately dedicated to preserving the orbiting forests and their natural inhabitants, and eventual returning them to Earth for reforestation of his now-barren planet more so than his crewmates, whose main priority seems to be returning to Earth after their one-year deployment to space.The main conflict comes when Lowell and his crew are ordered to destroy the orbiting greenhouses and redeploy the freighters to commercial service. Lowell decides to disobey orders and save the forests he has worked so hard to preserve.Lowell's crewmates manage to jettison and detonate four of the six greenhouse domes on the Valley Forge. Lowell kills one of his crewmates in a struggle to save the two remaining domes, during which he seriously injures his leg. He then manages to trap the other two crewmen in the other remaining dome, which he then jettisons and destroys.With help from the ship's three robots, Lowell feigns a premature dome detonation to fool his superiors, then alters the orbit of the Valley Forge , redirecting it towards Saturn in an attempt to preserve the last forest dome. Injured and alone with three robots, Lowell programs them to perform surgery on his leg.Still in communication with the rest of the fleet, Lowell is informed that the Valley Forge is on a collision course with Saturn's rings, and there is nothing he can do to stop the catastrophic event. The ship will likely be destroyed. With communications failing due to the distance now between the Valley Forge and the rest of the fleet, the ship passes through the rings of Saturn. While the three robots are outside the ship on maintenance duty, one is blown away from the ship, leaving two remaining robots. The ship, and its single greenhouse dome, emerge undamaged on the other side of the rings.Lowell and the two remaining robots chart a course into deep space, far away from the fleet. Alone except for his accompanying drones, Lowell befriends them and renames them Huey, Dewey and (posthumously) Louie. He teaches them to play poker, plant trees, and bury the killed crewmember.Lowell soon realizes that despite all his efforts, his forest is dying from unknown causes. In a desperate and rushed attempt to save the dome he badly damages Huey in an accident with one of the ship's buggies. Repairs are unsuccessful, the forest continues dying, and Lowell begins to come to realize that his mission to save the forest is bound to fail.After weeks alone in space, faint radio chatter is heard from a rescue party mounted from the Valley Forge's sister ship, the Berkshire, which has located the freighter after a long search. Finally able to communicate with Lowell, they inform him that they will be able to reach him within six hours he must jettison the dome but not detonate the nuclear charge, as it is too dark to do so safely.At this point it dawns upon Lowell that what was killing the forest was lack of sunlight. With little time to work, he activates a series of lights to simulate the sun and instructs his last active robot, Dewey, to ""just maintain the forest.""Realizing that his crime will be uncovered when the Berkshire finds him, Lowell jettisons the last dome to safety with the words ""take good care of the forest, Dewey.""With the Berkshire only two hours away from docking, Lowell and the damaged Huey sit facing each other while he arms the last of the six nuclear charges. As he prepares to destroy himself and preserve the last dome, Lowell says to Huey: ""When I was a kid, I put a note into a bottle, and it had my name and address on it. And then I threw the bottle into the ocean. And I never knew if anyone ever found it.""With that, Lowell destroys the Valley Forge with the last of the onboard nuclear charges.The final scene is of a well-lit forest greenhouse drifting into space, tended by the sole remaining robot with a battered watering can. The scene is accompanied by Joan Baez's rendition of the film's theme song."

tt0067800,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","The film opens with an out-of-focus image of what appears to be a swarm of bugs crawling about. But as the image sharpens, schoolchildren are at play in, of all places, a cemetery. The setting is the isolated village of Wakely on the coast of England.American mathematician David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman) is walking along a road while his newly acquired wife and one-time resident, Amy Sumner (Susan George), is parading braless and carrying a rather nasty-looking device called a 'mantrap'. David is introduced by Amy to Charlie Venner (Del Henney), an intense young man who is also an ex-lover of David's wife. David also meets two of Charlie's cousins named Janice Hedden (Sally Thomsett), and Bobby (Len Jones), her young brother.As Janice and Bobby are putting the mantrap in the back of the car, David explains that he came to Wakely, on sabbatical, to write a treatise on celestial navigation. To ensure the peace and quiet needed to complete his book, David agrees to hire Charlie and a mate to help several workmen make repairs on his new home.David enters the local pub, where he meets gruff bartender Harry Ware (Robert Keegan) and apologetically asks for any brand of American cigarettes they might have. As David makes way in the pub, Charlie discusses with Amy the possibility that she led him on in the old days with her taunting advances and was ""begging for it"". Amy, humiliated, retorts by spurning him. This is witnessed by David in the pub.In the pub, David sees Janice's father and town patriarch Tom Hedden (Peter Vaughan), falling into an argument with Harry over a pint. Charlie tries to calm down his uncle. A fight ensues. A repentant Tom makes amends by paying for the American's cigarettes. But David turns down Tom's offer and exits the pub.David and Amy are driving to their new cottage. They meet Norman Scutt (Ken Hutchison), who's busy fixing up their garage. While there, they also meet Chris Cawsey (Jim Norton), a giggling bloke who specializes in ridding the garage of rats. Chris and Norman are aware of the social turmoil and escalating violence of Vietnam-era American society, and that David somehow retreated to Wakely to escape his country's violence. They begin to challenge David, proving him to be spineless.At home, David becomes intensely preoccupied with his research. He is verbally abusive to Amy and her cat, who's often missing. This angers his wife. At one point, she defaces his blackboard and changes his mathematical equations. David responds by saying, ""what is this grammar school? Jesus Christ"".Meanwhile, David is helping his wife prepare for dinner when he sees Norman and Chris receiving a lift from friend and lorry driver Phil Riddaway (Donald Webster), a hulking presence who serves to round out the potentially menacing gang making life unpleasant for David.Norman, Chris, and Phil meet at the pub with Tom and company, where Tom begins to suspect pedophile and one-time podiatrist Henry Niles (David Warner) of molesting young girls, including his own Janice. Tom insists that Henry's brother, John (Peter Arne), ""keep a close watch on him"".David and Amy are getting ready for bed. The voyeuristic Janice spies on them. After a long night of lecturing and cheating antics, they retire for the night.On the next day, Amy becomes increasingly incensed by David's neglectful ways. She soon finds herself being ogled at by the men working on her house (Charlie, Norman, and Chris). She complains of this to David, who suggests she ""wear a bra"". David continues to denote he left his country on a ""grant to study"". ""You left because you didn't want to take a stand. Commit!"", says Amy. David finalizes the argument by saying ""we came here because you once told me that we could be happier"". Frustrated, Amy parades topless in front of the workers outside.The following day begins when Amy exclaims that her cat is missing. A frustrated David leaves the house, only to find himself terrorized by the workmen in Phil's lorry. On their way to the pub, they siphon their raging jealousy and contempt for the American academic by attempting to run his vehicle off the road.Outside the pub, David notices Janice getting too close to Henry. He becomes flabbergasted by John's violent treatment towards his brother, as well as Bobby's caveman-like attitude towards his sister.David enters the pub surrounded by his tormentors, who persist in jeering at him. There he meets local one-armed magistrate John Scott (T.P. McKenna), who informs of David's invitation to a church social the coming Thursday and accompanies him to the house where he meets Reverend Barny Hood (Colin Welland) and his wife.Back in the house, David is introduced to Barny and his wife. The fatuous vicar is in awe of David's research and his study of ""possible structures, interiors...radiation"". David calls himself an ""astro-mathematician"". He goes on to assess the importance of his scientific findings and the impact of religion on the mounting violence and bloodshed inherent in all present societies. It is learned that David came to Wakely mainly to escape the violence which has become a part of everyday life.Later that night, Amy's cat is found hanging in the closet. ""To prove to you that they can get into your bedroom"", in her estimation. Amy suspects Norman or Chris of killing her cat, while David states ""it could've been anybody passing"".David is reluctant to confront the workers over Amy's cat. Instead, by having Charlie, Norman, and Chris set up the mantrap over by the fireplace, he agrees to go out hunting with them.David accompanies Charlie, Norman, Chris, and Phil to the moors on a British version of ""snipe hunt"" where they keep him busy holding a sack open for the birds he believes will run into it. They spread about.While David is gone, Amy is visited by Charlie, who has been seething with lust over her. Amy feels Charlie has some knowledge regarding her slain cat, but he promptly tries to seduce her. When she refuses, he forces himself on her. In the process, Norman eventually shows up at the house and threatens Charlie at gunpoint. Norman gleefully rapes Amy as well, while Charlie begrudgingly assists his friend in holding her down.Amy doesn't tell David what happened. David tries to solve the problems in their marriage by ""going back to the basics"". He fires the four workers the next day. They ""stuck it"" to him on the moors, he explains.In a moment of dis-consolation, he sits in the field staring at an indeterminate distance.Some time later, the couple attend the local church function where the vicar Barny displays his penchant for magic tricks while the audience enjoys the show. Amy, haunted by memories of the rape, has a breakdown. As the show progresses, Janice approaches Henry. They leave the church and walk along the yard, as seen by Bobby. Bobby tells his father, Tom. The enraged Tom orders Bobby and John to find them. During this time, David and Amy have left the church as well. Tom, Charlie, Norman, Chris, and Phil visit the pub to learn of Henry's whereabouts. David, driving home in the dense fog, rescues Henry. Unbeknownst to David, Henry has just strangled Janice who was taunting him.Amy, aware of Henry's pedophilic tendencies, doesn't want Henry in the house. David tries to call the magistrate at the pub and informs Harry the bartender of Henry. Tom and his four young allies learn of Henry's whereabouts and go to the house to do violence to Henry.Since they ""know the American"", Charlie, Norman, and Chris ask for Tom and Phil to wait outside the house so they can find out where Janice is. David suddenly finds himself accosted by his three previous tormentors, two of whom raped Amy. David prevents them from hurting Henry, but Charlie says ""We've come to get this bloody freak...With your cooperation or without it"". As Henry proves unresponsive to their questioning, Charlie, Norman, and Chris agree to look for Janice until the doctor and police arrive.Enraged by the lack of knowledge of his missing daughter, Tom attempts to open the ""solid"" door while his cronies start blasting David's windows. One of them, Charlie, yells ""Look, you stupid yank. Let's have Niles before someone gets hurt."" David hides Henry in the lavvy.As the men lay siege to the house, what David says to Amy is key to understanding the situation. ""This is where I live. This is me. I will not allow violence against this house."" Moments later, the magistrate arrives to calm Tom and the others down but gets killed in the process. As accessories to a drunk who shot the sheriff, the men all decide to enter the house to get at Henry. Amy protests that David send Henry out, but he tries to keep them out of the house. He turns off the lights.David uses every means and skill he knows to fight them off. He boils whiskey and even opens the mantrap. Amy tries to leave, but David stops her. Realizing that ""they've gone too far to back down"",
David suggests Amy be cooperative if they are to survive the night. Using such household items as a poker and wire, he succeeds at keeping the men out of the house at every turn.As the relentless mob invade the house, David plays bagpipe music and decides to strike back. He squibs Tom's feet with gunfire. Tom later dies from his wounds. Phil climbs up the window, threatening to kill David. David dispatches him with a poker. Shortly thereafter, he turns on his living room light to find the knife-wielding Chris is inside the house. He beats the man to death with a poker. As Charlie prepares to shoot David, he is alarmed by Amy's screaming in her bedroom upstairs. Norman is trying to rape her. Charlie shoots him, and then finds himself fighting with David. David kills Charlie when he hits him over the head with the mantrap.David is slightly taken aback by the carnage. ""Jesus. I got 'em all"", David exclaims. A seriously wounded Phil appears out of nowhere and wrestles David to the stairs. Completely exhausted, David orders Amy to get the gun. She gets the shotgun and shoots the thug dead. There's no simple way back from the violence into which David has wandered.After the bloodbath, Amy stays in the house while David leaves with Henry. Henry complains ""I don't know my way home"", David replies, ""That's okay. I don't either."""

We then hear Raucher (voiced by Robert Mulligan) recalling the summer he spent on the island of Nantucket in 1942. The film flashes back to a day that then 15-year-old Herman ""Hermie"" Raucher (Gary Grimes) and his friends jock Oscy (Jerry Houser) and introverted nerd Benjie (Oliver Conant) spent playing on the beach. They are the self-proclaimed 'Terrible Trio'. They spot a young soldier carrying his new bride (Jennifer O'Neill) into a house on the beach and are struck by her beauty, especially Hermie, who is unable to get her out of his mind.They continue spending afternoons on the beach where, in the midst of scantily-clad teenage girls, their thoughts invariably turn to sex. All of them are virgins: Oscy is obsessed with the act of sex, while Hermie finds himself developing romantic interest in the bride, whose husband he spots leaving the island on a water taxi one morning. Later that day, Hermie finds her trying to carry bags of groceries by herself, and helps get them back to her house. They strike up a friendship and he agrees to return to help her with chores.Meanwhile, Oscy and Hermie, thanks to a sex manual discovered by Benjie, become convinced they know everything necessary to lose their virginity. Led by Oscy, they test this by going to the cinema and picking-up a trio of high-school girls. Oscy stakes out the most attractive one, Miriam (Christopher Norris), ""giving"" Hermie her less attractive friend, Aggie (Katherine Allentuck) and leaving Benjie with Gloria, a heavyset girl with braces. Frightened by the immediacy of sex, Benjie runs off, and is not seen by Hermie or Oscy again that night.Hermie and Oscy spend the entirety of the evening's film attempting to ""put the moves"" on Miriam and Aggie. Oscy pursues Miriam, eventually making out with her during the movie, and later learns her ways are well-known on the island. Hermie finds himself succeeding with Aggie, who allows him to grope what he thinks is her breast; Oscy later points out Hermie was fondling her arm.The next morning, Hermie helps the bride move boxes into her attic and she thanks him by giving him a kiss on the forehead. Later, in preparation for a marshmallow roast on the beach with Aggie and Miriam, Hermie goes to the local drugstore. In a painfully humorous sequence he builds up the nerve to ask for condoms.That night, Hermie roasts marshmallows at the beach with Aggie while Oscy succeeds in having sex with Miriam between the dunes. He is so successful he sneaks over to Hermie and Aggie to ask for more condoms. Confused as to what's happening, Aggie follows Oscy back, where she sees him having sex with Miriam and runs home, upset.The next day, Hermie comes across the bride sitting outside her house, writing to her husband. Hermie offers to keep her company that night and she says she looks forward to seeing him, revealing her name is Dorothy. She finally tells Hermie a little about herself; she is 22-years-old, and has been married to her husband for just under a year until he was recently drafted and has been sent to England in the US Army Air Corps. An elated Hermie goes home and puts on a suit, dress shirt and heads back to Dorothy's house, running into Oscy on the way; Oscy relates that Miriam's appendix burst and she's been rushed to the mainland. Hermie, convinced he is at the brink of adulthood because of his relationship with Dorothy, brushes Oscy off.He heads to her house, which is eerily quiet. Going in, he discovers a bottle of whiskey, several cigarette butts in an ashtray, and a telegram from the government. Dorothy's husband is dead; his plane shot down over France. Dorothy comes out of her bedroom, crying, and Hermie tells her ""I'm sorry."" The sense of empathy triggers her to channel to Hermie some of her loneliness. She turns on the record player and invites Hermie to dance with her. They kiss and embrace, tears on both their faces. Without speaking, and to the sound only of the waves, they move to the bedroom, where she draws him into bed and gently makes love with him.Afterward, withdrawing again into her world of hurt, Dorothy retires to the porch, leaving Hermie alone in her bedroom. He approaches her on the porch, where she can only quietly say ""Good night, Hermie."" He leaves, his last image of Dorothy being of her leaning against the railing, as she smokes a cigarette and stares into the night sky.At dawn, Hermie meets Oscy and the two share a moment of reconciliation, with Oscy informing Hermie that Miriam will recover. Oscy, in an uncharacteristic act of sensitivity, lets Hermie be by himself, departing with the words, ""Sometimes life is one big pain in the ass.""Trying to sort out what has happened, Hermie goes back to Dorothy's house. Dorothy has fled the island in the middle of the night and an envelope is tacked to the front door with Hermie's name on it. Inside is a note from Dorothy, saying she hopes he understands she must go back home as there is much to do to sort out her late husband's business. She assures Hermie she will never forget him, and he will find his way of remembering what happened that night. Her note closes with the hope that Hermie may be spared the senseless tragedies of life.In the final scene, Hermie, suddenly approaching manhood, is seen looking at Dorothy's old house and the ocean from a distance before he turns to join his friends. To bittersweet music, the adult Raucher sadly recounts that he never saw Dorothy again or learned what became of her.(After the film ends, the cast is given by showing a still photo of each of the primary cast members with a superimposed name. The movie had exactly eight on-screen speaking characters: Dorothy, the Terrible Trio, the three teenage girls and the druggist.)"

tt0067822,"['Horror', 'contentRating', 'PG13']","Roddy McDowell's one and only outing as director is a rather ingenious modern rendition of the classic old bard's tale. The Fairy Queen is now Michaela ""Mickey"" Cazaret, an aging millionairess (Ava Gardner) who is trying to keep herself young by surrounding herself with young people and sucking the life out of them - figuratively, if not literally. Her latest favourite is young Tom Lynn (Ian McShane). He's devoted to her, like the puppy the vicar's daughter (Stephanie Beecham) brings round.Well, Tom is instantly smitten with young Janet (said Vicar's daughter). After a night of drunken mayhem in Mickey's bedroom, Tom dons Mickey's gold-tinted sunglasses, grabs a bottle of wine for a little hair-of-the-dog and goes for a walk along the Scottish hills. Stopping at a stream, he spies Janet who is on her way to Carter Hall to return the check Mickey gave her as payment for the puppy. (She didn't want to give it up, so asked for 50 pounds, thinking no one would pay that much for a puppy). In an irritatingly choppy sequence of still images (the only such sequence in the film), it is evident that he has his way with her. On the way back to the Hall, they talk about Mickey and how wealthy she is (""She can afford to live in her dreams and she takes us into them for company."") At the gate, Tom tells Janet she must go no further - possibly protecting her from the jealous rage he knows Mickey would feel. Mickey already knows, though - her spy Elroy (Richard Wattis) has already reported the affair. Mickey confronts him in the garden, tells him she loves him, but she isn't as convincing as he is when he tells her he loves her. Already he is questioning the relationship.Back at the mansion, the others have convinced one of the gals to perform some psychic readings. They blindfold her and give her objects to hold - she tells them the impressions she gets. One guy places his ring on the table, but when she reaches for it, she grabs Mickey's sunglasses that Tom has set down. They freak her out. She screams and rips her blindfold off, demands to know who's they are. Tom wants to know what she saw, but she dismisses it and runs away in tears. Tom doesn't know just what to make of this. The following Sunday, Tom goes to church, listens to the vicar's sermon and waits for Janet outside afterwards. He spends the day with her and the little girl who is staying with the Vicar while her mom is in hospital. They have a picnic and take a long walk along the hills - a quiet  normal  day compared to the wild craziness that is life with Mickey.His absence has been noted back at the Hall and Tom endures some evil-minded ribbing from Oliver (David Whitman) who is obviously jealous of Tom's position in Mickey's bed. Oliver goes too far, though, and Tom throws a drink in his face, whereupon Oliver backhands Tom, causing a bloody nose, which enrages Mickey. She warns Oliver not to make trouble again or he's out and then she storms away. Oliver pretends to be apologetic, but Tom ignores him, grabs a bottle and wanders away himself. But Elroy, Mickey's part-time spy and full-time personal secretary of long standing, calls Tom into his office for a chat. He shows Tom some files about young men who have been found dead in the wreckage of one of Mickey's cars - seems to happen every 7 years or so - he even has photos. This obviously upsets Tom, as it was meant to. He thinks Mickey put Elroy up to it and goes to confront her.That evening, Tom announces his desire to leave, but she won't let him go. Some time passes and as Tom spends more time with Janet, he becomes increasingly unsatisfied with his situation with Mickey. He finally goes to Mickey and tells her he needs some time away to think. He's not asking this time, he's telling her. After one last pleasant evening at a night club together, Mickey tells him he can have one week to himself and then she's going to hunt him down and kill him. Meanwhile, Janet has found out she is pregnant. She tries to find Tom, but Mickey refuses to tell her where he is, so she decides to have an abortion. Because of an anonymous postcard, Tom finds her outside the abortion clinic in London before she can do anything and they spend a blissful week in his ""morbid little caravan"" before he spots Elroy spying on them and realizes the week is up and they need to run for it. Too late, though. Tom is jumped, roughed up and dragged back to Mickey for the final confrontation. Tom is scared, but defiant. He realizes what a monster she really is as one moment she is telling him how she's going to put him down like a rabid dog and the next she is asking him to say something nice to her because she's  ""feeling rather miserable."" She drugs him - forces him to drink what I gather is wine laced with LSD. Then the games begin. Mickey's new boy toy, Oliver, is running things. They're going to play ""Murder."" Usually a child's game, they're going to play it for real. Mickey will be the detective and Oliver the murderer, but who is to be the victim? It's surprising to Tom how ready and willing the other young'uns are to join in the hunt. They were his friends, after all. The subtle look he gives when a sweet girl points him out as the victim says it all. When the drug starts to take effect, Tom goes from fear to despair to defiance and then passes into oblivion at which point Mickey tells him to go get in the white car and drive as fast as he can. She is going to release her wild beasts and if they catch him, they'll tear him to pieces. So, he runs. Luckily, Janet knew where they were taking him and she shows up in time to jump in the car with him. He's driving like a maniac and almost kills them both (Now we know how those other guys died, right?), but Janet manages to get the car stopped. Back at the caravan (trailer for us Yanks), she had promised to hang on to him ( ""I love you, I want you and I need you but you must hold on to me"" ), but she's finding it difficult in his current state. Tom takes off across the field and into the woods, blindly running in terror. At one point, he imagines he's a bear caught in a trap and Janet finds him growling and twisting among the brambles. She gets him loose only for him to take off again. Next she finds him writhing in the mud - imagining his arms are a giant snake strangling himself. She is really struggling here! Again he takes off and runs to the river's edge where he kneels down for a drink, only for the water to turn to flame. She finds him now thrashing in the water imagining he is being consumed by fire. She gets him to shore where he finally collapses into her arms and this is how the others find them.The rage in Mickey's eyes when she finds Janet holding him is almost palpable. She wants him dead. She wants them both dead. But Oliver didn't sign on for actual  murder  - Tom was supposed to kill himself. It didn't work, so he calls the others off, earning himself a sharp backhand from Mickey. The only one who seems rather pleased by this outcome is Elroy. When the others leave, Tom - still pretty out of it - snakes his hand over to take Janet's hand in his. She is the only reason he is still alive - because she held on to him as she'd promised.And so Mickey is left with Oliver as her number one. She doesn't seem overjoyed by this as their plane takes off for parts unknown ..."

They stop near a pole and El Topo hands Hijo a teddy bear and a hand mirror with a picture of his mother. El Topo tells Hijo that he is now 7 years old meaning that he is now a man and to bury his first toy and his mother's portrait in the sand. Hijo buries the picture and the teddy bear the portrait while El Topo plays his flute. They later come across a town whose inhabitants have been slaughtered, and El Topo hunts down the perpetrators. El Topo and Hijo are traveling, when they are stopped by 3 bandits who El Topo kills, except for one who he chases and shoots multiple times with a rifle, until the bandit tells him that it was the Colonel, along with 5 other men, and that they are at the Franciscan mission. One of the bandits in the cathedral town murders several of the townspeople, while the other 4 do homosexual activities with the monks. El Topo arrives kills two of the bandits, castrates the Colonel (who then commits suicide), and the townspeople kill the remaining 3 bandits. El Topo abandons his son to the monks of the settlement's mission and rides off with the woman whom the Colonel had kept as a slave. El Topo names the woman Mara, and she convinces him to defeat four great gun masters to become the greatest gunman in the land. Each gun master represents a particular religion or philosophy, and El Topo learns from each of them before instigating a duel. El Topo is victorious each time, not through superior skill but through trickery or luck.After the first duel, a black-clad woman with a male voice finds the couple and guides them to the remaining gun masters. As he kills each master, El Topo has increasing doubts about his mission, but Mara persuades him to continue. Having killed all four, El Topo is ridden with guilt, destroys his own gun and revisits the places where he killed those masters, finding the first master's grave covered with honeycombs and swarming with bees, the second master's grave covered in a pyramid of sticks, and the third master's grave on fire. The unnamed woman confronts El Topo and shoots him multiple times in the manner of stigmata. Mara then betrays him and rides off with the woman, while El Topo collapses and is carried away by a group of dwarfs and mutants.El Topo awakens in a cave to find that the tribe of deformed outcasts have taken care of him and come to regard him as a God-like figure while he has been asleep and meditating on the gun masters' ""four lessons"". The outcasts dwell in a system of caves which have been blocked in - the only exit is out of their reach due to their deformities. When El Topo awakens, he is ""born again"" and decides to help the outcasts escape. He is able to reach the exit and, together with a dwarf woman who becomes his lover, performs for the depraved cultists of the neighboring town to raise money for dynamite to assist in digging a tunnel on one side of the mountain where the outcasts have effectively been kept imprisoned.Hijo, now a young monk, arrives in the town to be the new priest, but is disgusted by the perverted form of religion the cultists practice. El Topo goes to the church and unknowingly asks Hijo to marry him and the dwarf woman, Hijo becomes happy that there are still people in love. However, Hijo recognizes him and threatens to kill him on the spot for abandoning him as a child, but agrees to wait until he has succeeded in freeing the outcasts. Hijo grows impatient at the time the project is taking, and begins to work alongside El Topo to hasten the moment when he will kill him. At the point when Hijo is ready to give up on finishing the tunnel, El Topo breaks through into the cave. The tunnel has been completed, but Hijo finds that he cannot bring himself to kill his father.The outcasts come streaming out, but as they enter the town, they are shot down by the cultists. El Topo helplessly witnesses his community being slaughtered and is shot himself. Ignoring his own wounds, he massacres the cultists, then takes an oil lamp and immolates himself. His girlfriend gives birth at the same time as his death, and she and his son make a grave for his remains. Hijo and the dwarf woman with the baby ride off on horseback, the son now wearing his father's black gunfighter clothes. El Topo's grave is shown covered with honeycombs and swarming with bees, just like the first gun master's grave."
tt0067893,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'R']","On the dark outskirts of Los Angles on a desolate straight line road, a local outlaw racing event featuring muscle cars of the late 60's and early 70's is unceremoniously busted during a 1/4 mile drag race between a Plymouth Barracuda, and a primer gray '55 Chevy 150. As both cars cross the finish line, local police cruisers are seen heading at speed towards the racers and the onlookers at the staring line. As the Chevy evades authorities, it circles back to the staring line, picks up a passenger, and speeds away into the night while the sound of sirens fade off into the distance. From this getaway the driver and mechanic of the '55 Chevy begin an eastern trek to an undefined destination.A stop at a local park to swap out drag slicks invokes minimal dialogue, and a minimal look into the condition of the Chevy, which looks dusty and tired, but unveils disc brakes and a peculiar fiberglass trunk that detaches entirely from the car. It slowly becomes clear with no dialogue that the Chevy is a heavy duty, highly specialized, racing machine that receives maintenance roadside by the driver, and mechanic who tuned each component themselves. The driver comments on the busted race from the night before:
""That Plymouth had a Hemi with a Torqueflite. I believe we sawed the guy off even if we did loose $200.""The next stop: fuel. Here the audience hears more minimal dialogue between the driver, the mechanic, and gas station attendants, one of which is Richard Ruth, the mechanic who (for the film) constructed the 55 Chevy cars. More information is given about the Chevy, including the engine, transmission, and the meticulous nature of the mechanic tuning is conveyed with introverted valve work and a question to the station attendant:
""anything fast around here?""After departing the gas station, the pair continue east and brake for lunch at a roadside diner. Prior to lunch they are passed on the road by an orange GTO, with a middle-aged driver who is outwardly curious with the prospect of antagonizing the young Chevy occupants before he speeds ahead of the Chevy. Later at the diner, a wayward young girl is seem escaping an old delivery van decorated in a bright colored hippy art mural, she walks the parking lot eyeing the '55 Chevy, and plants herself in the backseat while the driver and mechanic eat lunch. After their meal, the driver and mechanic climb into the car without addressing the girl, start the engine, and continue to head east.The girl attempts to start conversation with the driver and mechanic which ends briefly and awkwardly, as the trio continue east towards Santa Fe, the GTO passes the Chevy again, blaring loud music in contrast to the droning emptiness of the Chevy, and a hand gesture i given by the GTO driver as he speeds past again.Later in Santa Fe the girl spends the afternoon in wanderlust, panhandling locals for change while the driver and mechanic cruise the local scene looking for racing action. Later in the evening the group heads to a local drive-in where the Santa Fe racing scene is in full swing. The driver and mechanic eye a prospective '32 Ford, and after a brief discussion a $300 dollar wager is agreed on for a 1/4 mile race. The race and booty is won by the Chevy, and the trio get a hotel room for the evening. The driver of the '55 Chevy disassociates himself with the mechanic and girl, goes to a few local bars, and returns to the hotel later that evening to a locked door and the sounds of young sex from the mechanic and girl.The following morning GTO picks up a suited hitchhiker with a Texas drawl and a 10 gallon hat. GTO (as he is referred to) talk in circles to the passenger about the GTO, where he came from, and how much performance it has. The hitchhiker is unimpressed and can see through the fabricated story that GTO's tall tales are hiding something deeper. This tension is broken when GTO passes the Chevy (again) as the Chevy is pulled over on the side of a lonely desert highway with the fiberglass clam shell hood open while the mechanic pulls spark plugs.
Mechanic: ""might be a fouled plug.""
Girl: ""I wish we were back in Santa Fe""As the journey continues, the girl is becoming increasingly bored and disaffected by the lack on attention she is getting, which she is not used to. As she laments and complains that she needs to use the restroom, the driver and mechanic decide to stop for gas after running the Chevy ""flat out"" at open throttle to keep the engine conditioned for performance racing.GTO arrives at a gas station, and the '55 Chevy arrives shortly thereafter. Tension between both cars boils over with the Chevy driver ending GTO's tough talk, and challenges him to a race. The distance is to Washington D.C and the wager is pink slips (cars). The mechanic spends a few minutes with GTO going over the route, the rules and procedures for mailing the car titles.
Mechanic: ""Ill do that part for you, I've done it before.""With the race officially on the driver and mechanic depart behind GTO and begin to plan for stops and weather. GTO starts the race by picking up another hitchhiker (after the first hitchhiker left at the gas station, presumably annoyed with GTO's talk. The new hitchhiker is heading to Oklahoma City. As another GTO lead conversation begins with false stories of the GTO being a ""test car"" from Detroit, the second hitchhiker asks if he can stretch out, which leads to him making homosexual advances to GTO, which GTO rejects.Rain begins for both parties as the Chevy is mired by archaic windshield wipers, the GTO is mired by the continual sexual advances of the hitchhiker. GTO eventually kicks the hitchhiker out on a rainy evening, and it pulled over later in the evening by Texas Highway Patrol. The Chevy sees the traffic stop and the pull over to tell the police that the GTO is dangerous, driving 90, and passing traffic on the right. After they hassle the GTO in front of the Troopers, the Chevy pulls away at full throttle, burning rubber in front of the Troopers and GTO, and head to the Oklahoma line before Texas authorities can catch up to them. GTO who is obviously infuriated by this stops the Chevy on the side of the road to yell at them for putting him in that situation. The parties agree to a truce, and trade snack and whiskey while GTO shows the trio a collection of uppers and downers that he takes at his pleasure. The group passes time together, as GTO tells the girl that the guys are not for her, the driver and mechanic glance at the GTO's 455 engine and tell GTO that his carburetor has a leak that could be dangerous. GTO, knowing that he cannot fix it himself laments that he is screwed to complete the race, while the trio in the Chevy agree to accompany him to the next town to get it fixed. GTO decides to ride in the Chevy with the driver while the mechanic and the girl ride in the GTO and listen to 8 tracks.During this portion of the trip GTO seems to break into another story about his past (being a television producer and getting laid off) which almost seems believable before the driver cuts him off.
Driver: ""I don't want to hear about it. Its not my problem.""The group drives all night and arrives at a closed Mobil station in a sleepy, rainy town. As the group waits, each has a task:Driver: rest, look for food
Mechanic: steal local license plate (they get nervous with California plates in the south)
GTO: use the restroom, drink whiskey, try to steal local licence plate
Girl: Run awayThe driver finds the girl hitchhiking by the interstate and takes her to a field to try to teach her how to drive. The driver is not a good teacher and the girl is disinterested, the lesson devolves into forced kissing.Back at the gas station the mechanic is asleep in the drivers seat of the GTO, while GTO is drunkenly passed out on the bumper of a shop truck which he was trying to steal a license plate from. A gas station attendant arrives for work seeing this scene, and calls the city police.
During the call to police the driver shows up in the Chevy with the girl as the rain clears and the faint sound of children playing in the background begins.Driver: ""It must be Saturday.""The driver and the mechanic get the drunkenly unconscious GTO in the car while a police cruiser arrives at the gas station. The driver and mechanic slowly drive away as the police begin to follow.Mechanic: ""I'll me you on the south of town on a dirt road.""
Driver: ""Okay, throw me my shirt.""The pair break off in different directions as the police begin to follow the mechanic in the Chevy. The Chevy outruns the police while the driver visits a local parts store for a carburetor rebuild kit. The mechanic and driver meet as planned, repair the gas leak for a still unconscious GTO, and drive off without him, continuing the race.GTO sobers up and races to catch up with the Chevy, which finds them eating lunch discussing racing as they are now broke from using all of their Santa Fe cash, while they discuss particulars a local southerner sits down with them and challenges them to a local race. The interaction is tense and condescending while the local boys accuse them of being hippies. GTO smooths over the interaction by assuring the locals that the driver and mechanic, which have long California hair are ""hometown boys"". The locals buy this, and summarily leave them alone.On their way to the dragstrip both the cars have odd interactions with hitchhikers and antagonizing muscle cars including the Chevy losing control to avoid an already fatal car wreck, and the GTO picking up a old woman and young girl who's parents were killed by an out-of-state driver.Upon arrival at Lakeland drag strip the Chevy begins time trial runs at the packed venue, while GTO and the girl tour the scene. The Chevy makes a wager with a local racer with a C2 Corvette using the mechanics tools as collateral. Later in the evening the Chevy wins this race while GTO and the girl make a break for D.C.The driver and mechanic take their winnings and quickly leave in hope to find the girl, rather than GTO. They catch up and pass the GTO at a diner, but the mechanic is reluctant to tell the driver because he knows the driver is becoming obsessive with winning the girl. Once the Chevy returns to the diner, the driver make one last attempt to win the girl over by proposing Columbus, Ohio as a post-race destination. The girl refuses, grabs her bags out of the GTO, and departs on the back of a strangers motorcycle who she has no spoken a single word to.Upon her departure a 454 El Camino arrives at the diner and challenges the Chevy to a race. The driver accepts as GTO leaves, saying his last words to the driver and mechanic.GTO: ""See ya.""GTO picks up two young GI's heading to New York City on liberty, the GI's compliment the car, and are eager to hear about GTO's adventures. GTO claims that he won the GTO by driving a '55 Chevy across country and beating the GTO by 4 hours. GTO puts himself in the story as the driver and mechanic and states""
GTO: ""There's nothing like building an automobile from scratch and wiping out one of these Detroit machines. Those satisfactions are permanant.""In the final scene we see the Chevy and the El Camino poised for launch on an old runway. The mechanic dials in the ignition advance, the driver straps in, and the race begins.During this race the film becomes shaky as it burns into the projector freezing the race in time before going to credits."
tt0067924,"['Horror', 'contentRating', 'PG']","Count Mitterhaus [Robert Tayman] was a vampire, preying on the children of the town of Stetl. With the death of one more child, the people became sufficiently enraged that they stormed the Count's castle and drove a stake through his heart. With his dying breath, Mitterhaus vowed, ""Your children will die to give me back my life."" Seven villagers went in, four came out -- Professor Albert Mueller (whose wife Anna had become the Count's willing consort), the Burgermeister, Dr Kersh, and Herr Hauser. Just as the castle is consumed in flames, the Count whispers to Anna, ""Tell Emil. He will know what to do.""Fifteen years later: The town of Stetl is dying, literally. A plague is slowly killing the people, although some believe it is the Count's curse at work. At any rate, neighboring villages, afraid that the plague/curse may spread, have placed roadblocks around Stetl, and they vow to shoot anyone attempting to leave or enter the town. Dr Kersh [Richard Owens] is among those who believes it to be a disease not a curse, and he plans to sneak out of the town and bring back knowledge and medicines from the city. With his son Anton [John Moulder-Brown] acting as a decoy, Dr Kersh manages to get away. Before his father leaves, Anton reminds him to find his girlfriend Dora Mueller [Lynne Frederick], the daughter of Professor Mueller [Laurence Payne] and tell her not to come back. Unbeknown to them, Dora is already planning to sneak through the roadblocks in an attempt to get back to her father and to Anton.Somehow, the Circus of Night manages to make it through the roadblocks. Tricks, performances, dancers, aerialists, wild animals -- the people of Stetl are, at least, to be entertained in their misery. But this is no ordinary circus. Serena [Serena], for example, dances totally nude, except for the tiger stripes on her body, aerialist twins Helga [Lalla Ward] and Heinrich [Robin Sachs] turn into owls as they soar through the air, and when the panther jumps up, he comes down in the body of Emil [Anthony Corlan], who seems smitten with the Burgermeister's daughter Rosa [Christina Paul], and she with him. Emil is a vampire, really Count Mitterhaus's cousin. The ring mistress, known simply as the Gypsy woman, is really Anna Mueller [Domini Blythe], and the twins are her children with the Count. Their purpose in Stetl is not to entertain, but to kill.First to suffer the consequences is the Burgermeister [Thorley Walters] when he is invited to make a special trip through the ""Mirror of Life."" At first, he is overcome with laughter at the silly distortions in the various mirrors. In the last mirror, however, he sees himself being bitten by the Count, who speaks to him, reminding him of his curse. Schilt [John Bown] and his family are among those who believe that the Count's curse is coming true. Schilt bribes Michael [Skip Martin], the circus dwarf, to lead him, his wife, and his mother out of town. Michael is happy to comply but leaves them stranded just beyond the roadblocks, where they are torn up by the panther. Next to be invited through the Mirror of Life are the Hausers, Jon [Roderick Shaw] and Gustav [Barnaby Shaw]. In the final mirror, they see the twins, Heinrich and Helga, who take them through. The next morning, their bodies are found lying on the ground, drained of blood, with holes in their necks. The Burgermeister, afraid that his daughter will be next, orders that all the circus animals be killed. Herr Hauser [Robin Hunter] shoots the monkey and the tiger, but just as the Burgermeister is about to shoot the panther, he has a heart attack, and Emil disappears. Next is Rosa's turn. Emil leads her to the crypt where the Count's body is being kept. There, Emil bites Rosa and allows her blood to spill on the Count. Emil vows that tonight Professor Mueller's daughter Dora will die, and the Count will live. During the next circus performance, Dora is invited through the Mirror of Life. Anton follows, just in time to see her go through the mirror. Heinrich prepares to bite her neck but is thwarted by the cross around it, and she is cast out of the mirror.Dr Kersh returns to Stetl with the information that the plague is actually a virulent strain of rabies caused by bats. He brings medicines, but he also brings the news that there are vampires in the land and that, in each case where people have been reported killed by vampires, the Circus of Night has stayed for a day or two. It appears that Stetl must rid itself of two plagues, not just one.Following her brush with the vampires, Dora has locked herself in the living quarters of the school where her father teaches. But that doesn't thwart the vampires. Emil gets through an open window on the second floor, changes himself into the panther, and attacks the students, killing every last one. Meanwhile, Heinrich, Helga, and the Gypsy find Dora. The Gypsy removes the cross from Dora's neck, and Heinrich and Helga draw in for the kill. Dora runs to the school chapel where she knocks over a cross that impales Helga and, by twin empathy, the gaping hole also appears in Heinrich's chest. Emil and the Gypsy escape, but the Strongman [David Prowse] breaks into Dora's house and takes her and Gerta Hauser [Elizabeth Seal] to the crypt. Hauser, Mueller, Dr Kersh, and Anton form a brigade of vampire hunters and they storm the circus, killing the Strongman. Hauser sets the Mirrors of Life on fire, but he becomes trapped in the flames and burns to death. The vampire hunters figure that the Count is probably in the crypt, so they head there.Meanwhile, Emil has just finished feasting on Gerta Hauser and turns his attentions to Dora. As he leans forward for the bite, the Gypsy (who has been holding Dora) aka Anna suddenly pushes her daughter to the side, and Emil bites Anna instead. Anton attempts to chase off Emil with a crucifix, but a bat knocks it out of his hand. Suddenly, the other vampire hunters break into the crypt and tussle with Emil. Emil kills off a number of them, but Mueller manages to pull the stake out of the Count's body and uses it to stake Emil. With the stake removed from his chest, the Count wakes up. He goes after Dora, but Anton beheads him with a crossbow. Only Dora, Anton, and Dr Kersh manage to survive the carnage. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl]"
tt0067927,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Thriller']","Barry Newman plays a car delivery driver named Kowalski who works for Argo's Car Delivery Service in Denver, Colorado and is assigned to deliver a white 1970 Dodge Challenger to San Francisco. Flashbacks which appear throughout the movie hint that he has either lost everything he has ever wanted and was reduced to taking the job of a car delivery driver as a last resort, or he is (what is called today) an adrenaline junkie. He is a Medal of Honor winning Vietnam veteran, a former law enforcement officer, former race car driver, and former motorcycle racer. He lost his job as a cop apparently after being framed in a drug bust, perhaps in retaliation for preventing his partner from raping a young girl. He seemingly gave up his automobile and motorcycle racing careers after two near-fatal accidents. He flashes back to a girlfriend, first in a snow-covered landscape, then at the California shore. Vera offers Kowalski marijuana, and comments on his war wound. Vera appears to be Kowalski's great love, and her death while surfing appears to be a major factor in Kowalski's alienation and resignation to death in the film.As the movie opens, Kowalski is near the end of his chase by the California Highway Patrol, where two bulldozers and a CBS News truck are setting up. After seeing the bulldozers, he turns around, only to run into three patrol cars further up the road. He then drives off the road to think, then gets back into the car and continues to drive back toward the roadblock. As the white Challenger passes a black Chrysler Imperial, the movie freezes, and the Challenger vanishes on Sunday at 10:02 am.The Imperial continues on, and the film then flashes back to Denver, Colorado, two days earlier on Friday at 11:30 pm, where Kowalski's journey began. He has just arrived in Denver with a black Chrysler Imperial he is delivering from San Francisco. His supervisor demands he get some rest, but Kowalski insists on taking on a delivery back to San Francisco that night. Kowalski is assigned to deliver the white Challenger. He stops at a biker bar to buy some Benzedrine pills and tells his dealer Jake (Lee Weaver) that he must get to San Francisco by 3 o'clock the next day (although the delivery is not due until Monday). They make a small bet (the cost of the speed), and Kowalski takes off at high speed out of Denver.Later Saturday morning near Glenwood Springs, Colorado, two motorcycle cops appear in Kowalski's rear view mirror and try to get him to pull over for speeding. He runs one off the road and, after stopping and seeing that the officer is unhurt, Kowalski takes off again and shakes the other officer by jumping across a trench. Kowalski is chased across the states of Colorado, Utah, and Nevada and into California, with the police unable to catch him. The whole way, Kowalski has his radio tuned to the station KOW, which is broadcasting out of Goldfield, Nevada. A blind African-American DJ at KOW known as Super Soul listens to the police radio frequency and encourages Kowalski to evade the police. Super Soul seems to understand Kowalski and, through a writer's conceit, seems to see and hear Kowalski's reactions.At one point Kowalski stops for gas at a remote station, and upon seeing the young woman at the gas pump, flashes back to a scene in his police career in which an older police officer molests a young woman of similar appearance in the back of a police car in an attempt to extract information about drug dealing. Kowalski intervenes to save the girl. In the present day, it is left somewhat unclear if this is the same woman or someone who reminds Kowalski of her.With the help of Super Soul, who calls Kowalski ""the last American hero"" on his radio show, Kowalski begins to gain attention among the counterculture and news media. Bikers and hippies flock to KOW radio in Goldfield to offer support. In a police chase in Nevada, Kowalski finds himself surrounded by police and flees into the desert. There, he blows a left front tire. After changing it, he encounters a rattlesnake and a snake catcher behind his car while placing the original tire in the trunk. Kowalski is helped by the old man who catches snakes in the desert to escape a police chopper that is now searching the desert for him. The old man leads him to a Pentecostal sect that reluctantly gives him fuel. The old man then redirects Kowalski back to the highway. There, he picks up two gay hitchhikers stranded en route to San Francisco with a ""Just Married"" sign in their rear window. They become combative and try to hold him up at gunpoint, but Kowalski throws them out of the car.In the afternoon of Saturday, a police officer and some unidentified thugs, shouting racial epithets, raid the KOW studio and physically assault Super Soul and his engineer. Near the California state line, Kowalski is helped by a hippie biker and his nude girlfriend, who has followed Kowalski's police career and made a collage of articles about his story. The impression is that she was infatuated with Kowalski, but she is unable to finish what she meant to say and rides away on her motorcycle. They discover that Super Soul's encouragement is now being directed by the police to entrap Kowalski; they give him more Benzedrine pills, and help him get through the roadblock trap by strapping a motorbike with a red light and air raid siren to the top of the Challenger, fooling the police into clearing the roadblock for him to speed through, putting him in California by Saturday at 7:12 pm. This means that 3:00 pm on SaturdayKowalski's original goalhas passed without comment. Kowalski calls Jake the dealer on a payphone, who has read about the chase in the newspaper. Kowalski reassures him that he's fine and still intends to deliver the car on Monday. However, the California police have put sensors on back roads that allow them to track Kowalski as he drives through the night.In the UK release of the film, Kowalski then picks up a mysterious hitchhiker (played by Charlotte Rampling). Kowalski accepts marijuana from her despite being shown refusing drugs (other than speed) several times in the past. He stops the car when he starts feeling stoned. She says she has been, ""waiting for him, everywhere and since forever."" When he awakens the next morning, she is gone, without a trace. According to interviews with Barry Newman and commentary from the director, the hitchhiker was a representation of death finally catching up with Kowalski.It is still early Sunday morning when Kowalski makes it to Cisco, California (a vacant cattle town in the Sierra Nevada foothills east of San Francisco, but actually filmed in the remote village of Cisco, Utah, abandoned today). There, with the California Highway Patrol in hot pursuit, Kowalski catches up to the opening of the film and crashes into the two bulldozers set up by the police as a roadblock, producing the fatal fireball of his death."
tt0067959,"['Adventure', 'Drama']","Somewhere in harbourside Sydney, Australia, a family lives within a high-rise apartment building where the mother is preparing a meal and listening to the radio. Her fourteen year old daughter (Jenny Agutter) and six year old son (Luc Roeg) swim in the building's pool overlooking a view of the ocean while their father (John Meillon), deep in troubled thought, watches them from their balcony.One day, the father takes his children, still in their school uniforms, on a picnic into the Outback. He parks the car and reads while his daughter sets up a blanket with their lunch. Her brother plays nearby with his water gun and toy soldiers. Suddenly, and for reasons unclear to his children, the father announces it is time to go and brandishes a gun, firing several shots at them. The boy thinks it all to be a game but his sister understands the danger and shields her brother as they run from their mad father. She watches in horror as her father returns to the car and sets it on fire before seating himself within and putting a bullet into his head. Quickly, and keeping her brother's eyes averted, the girl retrieves their radio, a scarf, and what food she can carry before setting off into the wilderness with her brother.The siblings walk for hours under the hot sun, calmed by irrelevant radio broadcasts, and walking past a host of wild creatures. Come nightfall, they make a crude camp for themselves, much to the boy's delight. In the morning, the girl leads them up a rocky hillside where she hopes to find some bearings. However, she can see nothing but a broad spanse of wilderness. When they finish their lemonade, the girl opens a can of vegetables from which they drink the juice. Recalling an uncle's story of military training, the girl suggests they eat salt to retain water and surmises to her brother that they may spend some time in the desert. She remains stoic, but wary, while her brother is blissfully unaware of their situation, remaining entertained by the radio and his toys. Eventually, after becoming filthy and tired, they come upon a lone tree standing over a pool of water where parakeets flock and feast on fallen fruit. The boy puts on in his mouth and proclaims that it 'tastes lovely'. They wash in the water and the girl scolds her brother to take care of his clothes so they will last. When he asks if they are lost, the girl replies that they are not, trying to remain chipper. They sleep to the sounds of the radio as night animals stir around them.In the morning, the girl wakes to find that their water hole has dried up and the fruit has either been eaten or spoiled. The girl decides to remain where they are, hoping that the water will return. As they nap in the hot sun, the boy spots an aborigine youth (David Gulpilil) pursuing an animal for food. They make contact and the children attempt to communicate with the aborigine boy. However, he does not understand their language and merely stares at them with curiosity. The girl repeats their need for water but the word is incomprehensible to the aborigine. When her brother mimics drinking, the aborigine understands and shows them how to dig for water using a hollow tube to drink through. Assuming that he will lead them to civilization, the siblings accompany the aborigine, unaware that he is on a 'walkabout', a coming-of-age journey that every male aborigine youth must take alone in order to be initiated as an adult in his tribe.As they travel the Outback, the aborigine kills and harvests food for them, giving them all plenty to eat and drink. The move from the desert to greener pastures and forests where wildlife becomes plentiful. When the boy becomes sunburnt from going shirtless, the aborigine rubs pig fat on his back to alleviate the burn. While communication between them remains limited, the trio share food and play together, though cultural differences are evident; the boy attempts to share his toy soldiers with the aborigine, but he finds no use for them and tosses them aside. Despite their time together, the aborigine and the girl develop a tension, in part due to their sexual maturity. While the girl remains wary and tries to keep her distance, the aborigine develops feelings for her. When he tries to talk to her, she does not understand, though her brother attempts to find meaning using pantomime. The aborigine boy stops near a rock cliff and draws a story on the rock face. The girl follows his lead and draws a house, hoping the boy will understand. He seems to.Aborigine workers and children surround a solitary house and trailer in the Outback, painted white with plaster from the figurines they're making. Their boss, a gruff white male overlooks their progress, berating them at times, while his wistful wife walks the property. She comes upon the aborigine boy and speaks to him but he rebuffs the woman's advances and walks away. The woman spots the children the boy is with but they remain unaware of her presence and follow the aborigine further into the wilds.So near and yet so far away, less than a few miles from the children's location, a group of scientists fiddle with weather balloons, though the men seem more interested in the solitary woman on their team. They look over at her every time she leans and one man goes so far as to eliminate further competition for her affections by letting loose one of their balloons, inciting a short chase by the other men. The balloon drifts away and eventually is caught in brambles and found by the aborigine boy. Tired, the girl asks him when they will reach their destination. Her brother translates the aborigine's signs that they should arrive that day.Later, they come upon a homestead overlooking a field of green and backed by a forest. The girl runs ahead along a picket fence but is upset to find that the home is deserted and crumbling. They set up residence there and the aborigine boy tries to speak to the girl but does not understand her sorrow. He watches her as she tours the home and begins to cry after finding some old photographs. He remains confused but understand when the girl asks for 'water'. Later on, the aborigine shows the boy a paved road near the homestead before going hunting. He chases an animal with his spear but is knocked aside as a truck carrying white men drives past and guns the animal down. The boy watches in silent confusion as the men tote the animal away.He returns to the homestead and ignores the girl's hello. His feelings culminating, he decides to perform a courtship dance for the girl, perhaps knowing that he can never return to his tribe. He paints himself with white clay and puts feathers on his arms and head. However, his dance frightens the girl and she shuts herself inside the house with her brother while he continues to dance outside into the night. Despite his visibly exhaustion, the girl refuses to speak to him. When her brother tells her of the road that he found with the aborigine, the girl decides that they will continue along their journey alone come morning.The next day, they dress fully in their school uniforms and collect their things. The boy looks for the aborigine, who has disappeared, but the girl insists that he went back to his people and that his absence is for the best. Her brother then tells her he tried to offer the aborigine his penknife as a gift, but the boy didn't take it. Puzzled, the girl follows her brother to where the aborigine had propped himself in a hanging position in the low branches of a tree, dead of exhaustion and heartbreak. The girl swats a few ants off the boy's body, looks at him sadly, and then takes her brother to the road. They follow it to a row of buildings near a mine quarry and knock on one of the trailer doors. An older man answers begrudgingly and tells them to leave. When the girl begs for help, he tells them where they can wait for someone to collect them. The siblings walk away from the trailer and its well watered lawn to the old mine where they play together among scrap metal.Years later, a young man returns home where he greets his wife, the girl now grown, and tells her that he's been promoted to a position that will finance a vacation on the Gold Coast. His wife's mind wanders and when he asks her what she's thinking of, she replies, 'nothing'. But we see her visions of years past when she and her brother bathed and played happily, and without trivial needs, in the Outback with their aborigine friend."

In the process of exterminating the rats, Willard saves them and finds as he feeds and plays with them that he can train the animals, by feeding them, and setting himself in their instincts as a rescuer. He baits the rats onto a pillar in the center of a well, and removes the wood bridge that they crossed. Then, as he fills the well, they are frantic, and he replaces the wood bridge; thus he cements their allegiance, and, in effect communicates with them.

tt0067992,"['Family', 'Fantasy', 'Musical']","Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) lives in poverty (of means but definitely not of spirit) with his mother and four grandparents. On his way home from school one day, his paper route takes him past the gate of the town's mysterious and reclusive, but highly-regarded candy-maker, Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder). As Charlie peers through the gates, a tinker walks by, telling Charlie that 'nobody ever goes in, and nobody ever comes out.Later that night, Charlie discusses this with his Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson). Joe explains that the man Charlie saw was right. Many years before, other candy makers (especially one Oskar Sluggworth) were sending spies into his factory to steal Wonka's amazing candy secrets. Finally, Mr Wonka locked the gates, and banished all his workers from the factory. Shortly after this, the factory started up, but no one knows who is making Wonka's candies now.The next day at school, word spreads quickly that a contest has been launched, with five golden tickets hidden in five ordinary Wonka chocolate bars. The big prize is that those who find these tickets, will get to visit Mr Wonka's long-isolated factory for a free tour, and receive a lifetime supply of chocolate. The world then goes crazy, with Wonka candies being sold out at almost every store.The first ticket is found by a gluttonous German boy, named Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner).The second ticket is found by a spoiled little girl named Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), whose father utilized his peanut factory workers to open Wonka bars from dawn until dusk.The third ticket is found by a girl named Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson), who is an avid gum chewer, having chewed a piece of gum for three months straight to achieve a world record.The fourth ticket is found by a boy named Mike TeeVee (Paris Themmen), who is obsessed with television, particularly programs regarding cowboys.And no one notices a mysterious, trenchcoat-clad man (Gunter Meisner) always showing up whenever anyone claims a ticket.While these children claim the tickets in turn, and while various adults go to absurd lengths to find the tickets on their own, old Joe uses his tobacco money to buy two Wonka bars, one at a time, for Charlie. Neither bar contains a ticket. But the bond between Charlie and Joe is all the stronger for that.Finally the Paraguayan television network announces that an eccentric millionaire, living in the Andes, has claimed the fifth ticket. With (as everyone thinks) no more tickets to hunt for, the world gets back to normal. Charlie spends one night wandering about town thinking of the chance he missed, but is back at school the next day, doing his best to put it all behind him.But the next morning, he finds a gold sovereign in a storm drain next to the candy shop. He fishes out the coin and goes in to buy some candy, including a regular Wonka bar. Then as he goes to claim his papers to start his route, he reads a stark headline: FIFTH TICKET FRAUD. While a crowd of adults is tsk-tsk-ing about the unmitigated gall that Paraguayan con artist showed, Charlie starts, very slowly, to unwrap the Wonka bar he bought. And what should he find within, but the fifth golden ticket!Charlie's discovery electrifies the townfolk: one of their own has claimed the genuine fifth ticket! So his fanfare consists of holding it up and celebrating for about a minute or so with his paper-route customers and anyone who happens to be looking on--no big deal compared to the media hype that greeted the other children, but that doesn't matter. Not to Charlie. What matters is at last he will get a chance to walk into the factory that has mystified him all his life. (The ticket also entitles him to a lifetime supply of chocolate, but he doesn't think of that just then.)But as he turns the corner, he runs into the very stranger who has insinuated himself into all the other celebrations (though Charlie, not being media-savvy, does not know this). The stranger introduces himself as Oskar Sluggworth and offers him stock certificates if he will quietly abstract from the factory a prototype of an Everlasting Gobstopper.Charlie rushes the rest of the way home and announces his find. So great is the wonderful shock that Old Joe can actually get out of bed!Charlie takes time to read the ticket's terms. Under them, the holder may bring one adult companion. Charlie selects Old Joe, who happily agrees.The next morning, the town does put on a celebration, with a band, to see the opening of the factory door. Promptly at ten o'clock, the door opens. Out walks a man leaning heavily on a cane, and follows a pathway on the pavement. He gets to the end of the path, and leaves the cane behind, stuck into the ground. And then he leans over, and is about to fall...and finishes with a somersault.This slightly crazy man is, of course, Willy Wonka. And that entrance sets the tone for the adventure that follows.He calls all the ticket holders to step forward. Verruca Salt insists on showing up first, though hers was the second ticket. Augustus Gloop doesn't care about things like that, and neither do the other children.Willy leads them all inside, where first he asks them all to sign a contract with print that starts out large and ends in being ultra-fine.In the tour that follows, the children, one by one, fall victim to pranks that play upon their most profound weaknesses of character. Augustus Gloop, the glutton, falls into a river of chocolate and gets sucked up in an extractor. Violet, the rude gum-chewer, starts chewing on a prototype that is supposed to have all the taste of a three-course meal, and seems to turn into a gigantic blueberry. Verruca, the selfish ingrate, falls through an ""egg-dicator"" and down a garbage chute. Mike Teevee, the TV addict, goes through something like a television transmission and ends up reduced to about a twelfth of his normal size.Charlie and Joe have not been immune. Shortly before the accident to Verruca, the two lag behind and steal ""Fizzy Lifting Drinks"" and end up floating up a chimney and risk running into an exhaust fan! They manage to burp their way down, and rejoin the others, thinking nothing of it. But at the end of the tour, Willy abruptly shuts himself in his office--which, when Charlie and Joe open the door, turns out to have furnishings sawn in half--half a clock, half a sink, half a table--and half a desk, where Wonka sits on half a chair. Joe diffidently asks about the lifetime supply of chocolate the ticket promised. Willy replies Charlie disqualified himself by breaking the contract. ""You STOLE Fizzy Lifting Drinks!"" he cries. ""You BUMPED into the ceiling which now has to be washed and sterilized! So you get NOTHING! You LOSE! GOOD DAY, sir!""All Joe can think of, is that Wonka has pulled a bait-and-switch. Now he encourages Charlie to let Oskar Sluggworth have the prototype Everlasting Gobstopper Wonka gave him earlier in the tour. But Charlie is having none of that. With consummate dignity and grace he approaches Willy one last time and sets the prototype on the half-desk next to Willy's left hand.And Willy almost transforms. ""You won! You WON!"" he cries, reaching for Charlie to hug him. ""Oh, I'm sorry to put you through this. Now I want you to meet someone."" In walks Oskar Sluggworth--or rather, a Mr. Wilkinson, who is Willy's executive assistant!Willy then asks Charlie and Joe to join him in one last thrill-ride: the Wonka-Vator, a turbocharged levitating craft with one button he has never pressed, and now encourages Charlie to press. That one button press sends the craft, and the three, to crash through the glass ceiling and to a height that commands a view of the factory and the town around it. Now Willy reveals his true purpose: he sent out the five golden tickets in the hope of recruiting a successor. And Charlie is the sole qualifying applicant. To make the deal sweeter, Willy encourages Charlie to move in at once, with all his family. Charlie enthusiastically accepts this ultimate award.========================================================CommentariesThe original child actors, as adults, recorded a commentary track for the DVD edition of this title. Julie Dawn Cole (Verruca) developed a theory that Willy Wonka did not let those tickets fall at random. Instead, Mr. Wilkinson/""Oskar Sluggworth"" deliberately placed those tickets with four children who could each use a lesson in humility, and with Charlie. Willy surely noticed Charlie all his life, and no doubt decided on him as his successor. But first he must test Charlie. Hence the other four contestants, who could never qualify, and the tour taking him conveniently past the Fizzy Lifting Drinks. Hence also how conveniently Charlie could find a gold sovereign in a storm drain, on the very morning he can read a banner headline exposing the Paraguayan claimant as a fraud.The test, of course, was not whether Charlie would forgo the temptation. It was how he would handle rejection due to bait-and-switch. Charlie handled himself like a champion; hence his victory."

Unknown to Kessel, Joe has been devising a plan with his girl friend, American expatriate prostitute Dawn Divine (Goldie Hawn), to take the contents from bank safe-deposit boxes owned by several criminals and place them into one owned by Dawn.As Joe explains to Dawn, the theft will be beyond the law because the thefts of illegal funds can never be reported. Joe's plan depends upon his intellect and knowledge of the bank's expensive vault, coupled with information that Dawn supplies to him about some of her clients: Sarge (Scott Brady), an American sergeant who is involved in the black market, and has recently graduated to smuggling heroin; an attorney known only by his nickname Mr. Las Vegas, (Robert Webber) who is helping his Las Vegas clients evade taxes; and Candy Man (Arthur Brauss), a sadistic killer and drug dealer.Although Joe has arranged for his friend Helga (Christiane Maybach), a striptease dancer at a gangster-run nightclub, to report on Candy Man, she is killed, apparently after arranging for Dawn to meet Candy Man and accompany him on a flight to Copenhagen. Unknown to Dawn, Candy Man is to deliver some concentrated LSD that he has poured into an empty champagne bottle.On the flight, he gives Dawn the champagne to carry in her bag, telling her to save it for later. Upon their arrival in Copenhagen, though, she is stopped by customs officials, who say that they were given a tip (from Joe) that she might be smuggling drugs into the country. While they are questioning her, Candy Man surreptitiously takes the champagne and walks away. When Dawn is let go by the authorities, she returns to Hamburg, to the relief of Joe, who did not find out about Helga's death until after it was too late to stop Dawn.On the day of the heist, which Joe had already announced was his last before returning home, Joe sets his plan in motion by telling some of the bank employees to watch out for a suspicious-looking man with a scar. At the specified time, a nervous Dawn, who has been practicing her lines all morning, calls and whispers a threat to blow up the bank if Kessel does not give a man with a scar the gold bar on display in a secure case in the lobby. A nervous Kessel alerts Joe, who goes with him to retrieve the gold bar, then quickly grabs it and runs into the vault as he orders the clerk to shut the vault door immediately. Kessel and the others at the bank are amazed by Joe's bravery but worried when they realize that he had left the key to open the vault from the inside on his desk. Kessel communicates with Joe through the bank's video security system and assures him that the police are on their way and will look for the bomb. He also insists, over Joe's assurances that he will be fine and Kessel should not ruin a $50,000 door, on using a blowtorch to break the vault's lock because he fears that the air will not last until the next morning when it would automatically open.After the police determine that there was no bomb, scores of spectators and media arrive at the bank. While his plight is being reported extensively on local German television, Joe quickly unlocks and empties the targeted safe-deposit boxes, placing the content of each into Dawn's box and timing his activities to avoid the security camera's sweeping lens. Meanwhile, thousands of people throughout Germany are watching television and hailing Joe for his bravery, even Sarge and Mr. Las Vegas. When the welder finally breaks through the vault door, Joe has completed his job and the safe-deposit boxes appear to be untouched.The next day, when Sarge comes to empty his safe-deposit box, he sees Joe and congratulates him for his ""American know how"" and bravery. As Sarge and Candy Man go into private rooms to open their respective safe-deposit boxes, they are stunned to find them empty, as is Mr. Las Vegas, who collapses in shock.Meanwhile, Dawn, who has entered the bank and taken the contents of her safe-deposit box, now bursting with cash and Candy Man's champagne bottle, is barely able to leave the bank without the assistance of an eager Kessel, who finds her attractive.As the day goes on, Candy Man is threatened and savagely beaten up by his drug contacts for not having their money, and Sarge, believing that his partner, the Major (Robert Stiles), has robbed him starts to beat him up until Candy Man arrives and tells them that only the people who could not report their theft had been robbed. As they ponder what has happened, Candy Man sees a photograph of Sarge and Dawn, then takes Sarge and Major to her apartment. Although Sarge thinks that Dawn is ""a dumb broad,"" incapable of being involved in the robbery, they find Joe's name and telephone number in her address book, then call him and quickly hang up. Candy Man, who says he does not believe in coincidences or heroes, waits while Sarge calls Kessel to ask for Joe's home address, saying that he is a friend who lost his address. Kessel is at first reluctant to reveal the information but relents when Sarge says that he needs it for a party, which Kessel assumes is Joe's going away party. Kessel then has second thoughts and calls Joe to inform him what he has done. Joe tells him that it is not a problem, then quickly packs up all of the cash that he and Dawn have been counting. Dawn adds the champagne bottle to the suitcase (unaware about the contents) she will take, then, on Joe's instructions, drives away in his car just as Sarge, the major and Candy Man arrive.While the Major follows Dawn, Sarge and Candy Man pursue Joe into his building, then through the backstreets and rail yards of Hamburg. Meanwhile, Dawn eludes Major by boarding a train that is about to leave, then jumping off as it pulls out of the station.Sarge and the Candy Man continue to chase Joe through the city and the underground Elbe Tunnel before Joe makes his escape from Hamburg by hiding in a car being transported on a car hauling trailer. Candy Man writes down the truck's license plate number and makes a call to the destination of the truck.Early the next morning, Sarge and Candy Man see the trailer out in the country and moments later spy Joe walking through the snow. They jump into Sarge's car and follow the road around a frozen lake, and when the car gets stuck in some slush, Candy Man jumps into another car and drives out onto the lake. As Candy Man drives back and forth trying to run down Joe, the ice begins to crack and the car sinks, sending him plunging to his death in the icy water.Now Joe starts to run toward a moving train as Sarge gets into his car and follows. Some time later, as Joe is sleeping in a compartment on the train, Sarge (having stopped the train with a road flare on the train tracks to secretly embark) puts a gun to his head. He demands the money, but when Joe opens the suitcase... it contains only old newspapers and the bottle of champagne. Joe then says that Dawn has cheated all of them and convinces Sarge to work together to find her. They decide to open the bottle of champagne to seal the deal, but while Joe looks at his glass and wonders why there are no bubbles, Sarge drinks straight out of the bottle and almost immediately begins to writhe in pain as the concentrated LSD takes effect. When the train arrives at the next station, Joe throws the suitcase into the trash and walks away.Some time later, Dawn checks into a Southern California resort and is happily reunited with Joe, telling him that she knew that they would never kill him as long as he did not have the money."
tt0068156,"['Drama', 'Family', 'History', 'Musical']","On the evening of May 8, 1776, in Philadelphia, as the Second Continental Congress proceeds with its business. John Adams, the widely disliked delegate from Massachusetts, is frustrated, because none of his proposals on independence have been debated on by congress. The other delegates, implore him to ('Sit Down, John')Adams' response is that Congress has done nothing for the last year. He goes outside and in song ('Piddle, Twiddle, and Resolve'), he reads the latest missive from his loving wife Abigail, who, their home in Braintree, Massachusetts, appears in his imagination. He asks if she and the other women are making saltpeter for the war effort but she ignores that and states the women have a more urgent problem: no straight pins. They pledge their love to each other in song ('Till Then').The next day, Adams finds delegate Benjamin Franklin outside. Adams bemoans the failure of his arguments for independence. Franklin suggests that, a resolution for independence would have more success if proposed by someone else. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia enters on horseback, having been summoned by Franklin. The cocky Lee crows that he is the best man to propose the resolution. Adams has reservations, but Lee is convinced he cannot fail, as a member of the oldest and most glorious family in America ('The Lees of Old Virginia') He is prepared to ask the Virginia House of Burgesses to authorize him to offer a pro-independence resolution.On June 7, 1776, Franklin and Adams enter, and the delegates, along with the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, take their places. Hancock gavels the 380th meeting of the Congress to order.The entire New Jersey delegation is absent. Thomas Jefferson, a young delegate from Virginia, announces that he is leaving for Virginia that night to visit his wife. Soon after Hancock opens the floor to new resolutions, Richard Henry Lee canters into the chamber, having finally returned from Virginia. Lee reads his resolution, but John Dickinson of Pennsylvania moves to indefinitely postpone the question of independence. A vote is taken. Six colonies vote in favor of debate. Five vote to postpone indefinitely and thus kill the proposal.The New Jersey delegate arrives, and the vote now stands at six for independence and six against (with New York abstaining ""courteously""), and Adams reminds Hancock (who supports independence) of his privilege as president to break all ties. Dickinson then moves that any vote for independence must pass unanimously on the grounds that ""no colony may be torn from its mother country without its own consent."" The vote produces the same tie, which Hancock breaks by unexpectedly voting for unanimity (prompting an angry outburst from Adams). He reasons that without unanimity, any colony voting against independence would be forced to fight on England's side, setting brother against brother.Adams, thinking fast, calls for a postponement of the vote on independence, expressing the need for a declaration defining the reasons for independence. Franklin seconds Adams, but when asked why such a declaration should be written, both are lost for words until Thomas Jefferson provides them himself: ""to place before mankind the common sense of the subject, in terms so plain and firm as to command their assent."" The vote on postponement is called, producing yet another tie, with New York abstaining ""courteously"" yet again. Hancock breaks the tie by voting in favor of postponement. He appoints a committee of Adams, Franklin, Roger Sherman of Connecticut, Robert Livingston of New York, and Jefferson to draft the declaration. Hancock adjourns the session over Jefferson's complaints that he must go home to his wife.The Committee of Five argues about who should write the declaration ('But, Mr. Adams'). Adams declines Franklin's suggestion that he do so. Adams asks each of the others, in turn, to be the drafter, but each demurs: Franklin argues that he is not a political writer, only a satirist; Sherman claims that he is not a writer at all, but ""a simple cobbler from Connecticut""; and Livingston must return to New York to celebrate the birth of his son.All eyes then turn to Jefferson. Jefferson tries to wriggle out of the responsibility, pleading that he has not seen his wife in six months. Adams, unmoved by Jefferson's arguments (as he, too, misses his own wife), quotes a passage of Jefferson's Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms, bluntly telling Jefferson that he is the best writer in Congress. Jefferson accepts the duty of drafting the document.A week later, Adams and Franklin visit Jefferson to see how the work is coming along. Jefferson has spent the week moping, prompting a sharp rebuke by Adams, which is flatly rebuffed by Jefferson. Finally, Jefferson is brightened when his beloved wife Martha enters (Adams has sent for her). The two older gentlemen leave the young lovers in peace. Adams, alone, again exchanges letters with his wife Abigail. They pledge each other to be eternally ('Yours, Yours, Yours'). Martha finally appears when Franklin and Adams return the next morning, and the two gentlemen ask her how a man as silent as Jefferson won a woman as lovely as she. She tells them that she loves him ('He Plays the Violin').On June 22, 1776, Congress has reconvened. By now, Adams is worrying and begins trying to win over some of the states, sending Thomas McKean to try to convince his Delaware colleague George Read and Franklin to convince James Wilson of Pennsylvania, while himself trying to convince Samuel Chase of Maryland.The remaining delegates in favor of independence also leave the chamber. Alone with his fellow conservatives for the first time, Dickinson leads them in a minuet, singing of their desire to hold onto their wealth and remain ('Cool, Cool Considerate Men'). During their dance/song, another dispatch comes from George Washington warning them of British advances on Philadelphia; however these warnings fall on deaf ears.After the dance number, the remaining delegates depart, leaving Andrew McNair (the custodian), the courier, and a workman in the chamber. The workman asks the courier if he has seen any fighting and the courier replies that his two closest friends were killed on the same day at Lexington. He describes the final thoughts of a dying young man as his mother searches for his body ('Momma, Look Sharp').Jefferson is outside the chamber as Mr. Thomson, the secretary, reads the declaration to Congress. Adams and Franklin meet him delightedly: an exhibition of shooting by the Continental Army has convinced Samuel Chase, and Maryland will vote in favor of independence. They congratulate Jefferson on the excellence of the document, and Franklin compares the creation of this new country to an egg ('The Egg'). This leads the trio to debate which bird is breaking out of its metaphorical shell and would best represent America. Franklin tries to coax them into choosing the turkey, but the three settle on the eagle, as insisted upon by Adams.On June 28, 1776, Hancock asks if there are any alterations to be offered to the Declaration of Independence, leading many delegates to voice suggestions. Jefferson acquiesces to each recommendation, much to Adams's consternation, until Dickinson demands the removal of a phrase calling the King a tyrant. Jefferson refuses, stating that ""the King is a tyrant whether we say so or not. We might as well say so."" When Thomson comments that he has already scratched the word out, Jefferson orders him to ""scratch it back in."" When one delegate wants references to Parliament removed for fear of offending possible friends in that body, an exasperated Adams exclaims ""This is a revolution, damn it! We're going to have to offend somebody!""Edward Rutledge of South Carolina objects to a clause in the Declaration condemning the slave trade, accusing the northern colonies of hypocrisy and telling them that the prosperity of the North depends on the Triangle Trade ('Molasses to Rum') to slaves as well. When this clause is not removed, the delegates of the Carolinas and Georgia walk out of Congress. The resolve of the other delegates is broken, and most of them also leave. Franklin tells Adams that the slavery clause must go; when Adams quarrels with him, Franklin angrily reminds Adams that ""the issue here is independence!"" and berates Adams for jeopardizing the cause. Adams' faith in himself is shaken, and only encouragement from Abigail (and the delivery of kegs of saltpeter from her and other Massachusetts ladies) bolsters his commitment ('Compliments').Re-reading the dispatch from Washington, Adams, now alone in the chamber, echoes his words in song ('Is Anybody There?') Discouraged but determined, Adams declares his vision of his new country: ""Through all the gloom, through all the doom, I can see the rays of ravishing light and glory!"" Dr. Lyman Hall of Georgia, unexpectedly returns to the chamber. He tells Adams ""In trying to resolve my dilemma I remembered something I'd once read, 'that a representative owes the People not only his industry, but his judgment, and he betrays them if he sacrifices it to their opinion.' It was written by Edmund Burke, a member of the British Parliament."" Hall then walks over to the tally board and changes Georgia's vote from ""nay"" to ""yea"".It is now July 2, 1776. The delegates slowly return to the chamber, including Caesar Rodney of Delaware, who had earlier left Congress due to poor health. Hancock calls for the vote on the Lee Resolution. Thomson calls on each delegation for its vote. Pennsylvania passes on the first call, but the rest of the northern and middle colonies (save New York, which, with some self-disgust, again abstains ""courteously"") vote ""yea"". When the vote reaches South Carolina, Rutledge again demands the removal of the slavery clause as the condition of the ""yea"" votes from the Carolinas. Franklin pleads with Adams to remove the clause (""First things first, John ... Independence. America. If we don't secure that, what difference will the rest make?"") and Adams turns to Jefferson. Jefferson reluctantly crosses the chamber and scratches out the clause himself. Rutledge and the Carolinas vote ""yea"", as does Georgia.Pennsylvania's vote, which is the last vote needed to obtain the required unanimous approval, is called again, Dickinson declares that ""Pennsylvania votes..."", only to be stopped by Franklin who asks Hancock to poll the members of the delegation individually. Franklin votes ""yea"" and Dickinson ""nay"", leaving the swing vote to Wilson, who normally adheres to Dickinson. Seeing his hesitancy, Dickinson tries to entice him: ""Come now, James ... the issue is clear."" Franklin remarks that ""most issues are clear when someone else has to decide them"", and Adams mercilessly adds that ""it would be a pity for a man (Wilson) who has handed down hundreds of wise decisions from the bench to be remembered for the one unwise decision he made in Congress."" Wilson doesn't want to be remembered as ""the man who prevented American independence"" and votes ""yea"". The motion is passed.The next day on July 3, Hancock suggests that no man be allowed to sit in Congress without affixing his signature to the Declaration. Dickinson announces that he cannot in good conscience sign such a document and still hopes for reconciliation with England. However, he resolves to join the army to fight for and defend the new nation. Adams leads the Congress in a salute to Dickinson as he leaves the chamber.The next day, Hancock leads the delegates in signing the Declaration, but is interrupted by the courier with another dispatch from Washington, ""Commander of the Army of the United Colonies ... of the United States of America."" He reports that preparations for the Battle of New York are under way, but expresses concern about America's badly outnumbered and under-trained troops. Washington's note to Lewis Morris that his estates have been destroyed but that his family has been taken to safety emboldens Morris to state that he will sign the Declaration, despite the lack of instructions from the New York legislature, saying, ""To Hell with New York. I'll sign it anyway."" New York's vote is moved into the ""yea"" column.On the evening of July 4, 1776, McNair rings the Liberty Bell in the background as Thomson calls each of the delegates to sign their names on the Declaration of Independence. The delegates freeze in position as the Liberty Bell rings to a fevered pitch."
tt0068168,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","A trade of drug money is occurring between two Italians (from the South of 110th street in New York) and three blacks (from Harlem to the North of 110th Street). Suddenly, two men (Paul Benjamin & Ed Bernard) uniformed as police officers knock on the door. When they enter one of the two men dressed as cops holds the drug dealers hostage with a machine gun. When one of the black hostages reaches for his pistol, the man shoots everyone in the room to death, except his partner. When the two killers rush out with the drug money, they hop in a car with their driver (Antonio Vargas). When the driver nervously hits a few of the cars around them, it attracts the attention of an African-American cop, who is shot to death by the man with the machine gun before he realizes what's going on. Another cop (this one white) comes upon the situation and pulls his gun, but is fatally hit by the getaway car.Seemingly before the cops are aware of the situation, the two crime syndicates are aware that they've been ripped off. Mafioso Nick D'Salvio(Anthony Franciosa) is coached by his Don (who is also his father-in-law) that this is an opportunity to keep the blacks in check and that he must severely punish the men responsible for the robbery and the murder of the two Italians. D'Salvio pays a visit to the black crime boss in Harlem, Doc Johnson (Richard Ward). Johnson promises to put his main henchman, Shevvy (Gilbert Lewis), on the the trail of the thiefs. But D'Salvio threateningly intones that, while Shevvy may find them, the punishment must be left to the Italians. Johnson, unintimidated, taunts D'Salvio as a ""punk errand boy"", causing D'Salvio to try to attack him. However, D'Salvio's henchman hold him back and calm him before they leave.The police have finally arrived and are all over the building where the drug theft and massacre occurred. Aging Cpt. Mattelli (Anthony Quinn) arrives prepared to oversee the investigation. However Mattelli's chief lets him know to his chagrin that the much younger (and African-American) Lt. Pope (Yaphet Kotto) will be leading the investigation. Pope mistrusts Mattelli because he rightly believes Mattelli to be a drunk, a racist, and a crooked cop who doesn't hestitate to beat up suspects or even crime witnesses.The mostly black residents in the surrounding neighborhood of the crime (although we know many of them witnessed the crime) refuse to disclose information to the police. However, they gladly let Doc Johnson know the vehicle that was used in the getaway. Shevvy and D'Salvio use this track down it's new owner, Henry J. Jackson, who we recognize as the getaway driver of earlier. Meanwhile, tipped off to the vehicle's location, Mattelli and Pope have the car pulled out of the Hudson River. However, before they can figure out who was driving, Shevvy and D'Salvio have tracked down Jackson to a whorehouse. D'Salvio smashes Jackson in the face with a glass and then beats him to the floor until Jackson is a bloody pulp. Before they leave, Shevvy is given Jackson's clothes and finds a note from a dry cleaners. The police find Jackson tied up in crucifixion and that he's been castrated. Pope and Mattelli try to get Jackson to tell them the identity of his killer in an ambulance, but Jackson is only able to scream in agony before he dies.Joe Logart (Bernard), who we recognize as one of the thieves dressed as a cop at the beginning, nervously sees the TV report of Jackson's murder. He is an employee at the same dry cleaner that Jackson had a note from. He goes to see the other, more trigger happy thief, Jim Harris (Benjamin), to let him know that he's going to try and leave the area. Logart suggests that Harris should escape as well, but Harris refuses and wishes Logart well. We find that Harris lives with his girlfriend and has told her about the robbery. Harris is a 42-year-old ex-con and tells her that there's no way he could make money other than by crime.Mattelli takes Pope to Doc Johnson's office. Mattelli warns Johnson ""no more crucifixions!"" However, Johnson is again unfazed and denies involvement in Jackson's murder. For Pope's benefit, Johnson announces that Mattelli has long since been paid off by Johnson for looking the other way in numerous crimes. Mattelli nearly attacks Johnson but sadly backs away. Johnson makes it clear that he no longer wants to deal with Mattelli and offers Pope to take his place. However, the honest Pope tells Johnson to take his money and ""stick it up your ass"". When Shevvy tries to manhandle Mattelli out of Johnson's office, Mattelli assaults him and beats him badly. However, Pope manages to pull Mattelli away.Logart, bags all packed, hails a cab. The cab driver acts suspicuously and calls into say that this be his ""last fare of the night"". Suddenly, two cars, containing D'Salvio, Shevvy and their henchmen, pull in front of the taxi. The cab driver runs off, but Logart manages to jump to the driver's seat and drive off. He runs down one of Shevvy's men and shoots another. Logart speeds off, but hits traffic with the two cars coming after him. Logart abandons the taxi and runs into an empty high rise being built. He manages to kill a couple more henchman, but Logart is soon surrounded and overpowered on one of the highest floors. D'Salvio and his men hang Logart by his ankles and swing him off the edge of the building. They threaten to let him fall to his death if he doesn't disclose the identity of his crime partner. He eventually does tell them about Harris, but D'Salvio still lets Logart die.Mattelli and Pope go to visit Jackson's estranged wife. They let her know that Jackson has been killed, but Pope claims it was in a car accident. When they question her about Jackson's associates, she recalls Jim Harris's name. Going through police records, Mattelli and Pope narrow the various suspects down to the most likely ""Jim Harris"". Mattelli soon offers to confess to his various illegal activities so Pope can take his position, but the angry Pope refuses, saying he wants to become Captain on his own terms.Harris leaves his girlfriend's apartment to go to an abandoned hideout nearby. However, he seems to have forgotten his medicine and goes into a seisure. When his girlfriend rushes to his hideout to give him his medicine, she is followed (without her knowledge) by Shevvy, who concludes that she must be going to see Harris. Shevvy and Johnson tip off D'Salvio to Harris's location, after which Johnson claims to know how this situation is going to turn out.The next morning, D'Salvio and a few henchmen go to the building where Harris and his girlfriend are hiding. D'Salvio knocks on his door and claims to be police. Harris immediately opens fire through the door, killing one of D'Salvio's henchmen. D'Salvio returns fire into the apartment, shooting and killing Harris's girlfriend. D'Salvio and Harris shoot it out through the hideout door. Harris eventually shoots D'Salvio and then knocks him over with the door, sending D'Salvio down the stairs to smash his face through a window . D'Salvio dies screaming. Harris goes out the street and mows down all of D'Salvio's henchmen with his machinegun. When a cop car pulls up, Harris also guns down both cops inside.Soon, the building is surrounded by cops, including Mattelli and Pope, and Harris takes refuge inside. The police trade fire with him until he is cornered on the roof. We see an unnoticed Shevvy crouched on the roof a nearby building, armed but seemingly enjoying the violent spectacle. Although Harris kills a few more cops, some snipers shoot him in the side and the arm. Harris throws his bag of hard-fought drug money over the side of the building into a crowd of onlookers, who fight over it. Mattelli climbs up to confront Harris, but lose his footing and is soon at Harris's gun point. However, before Harris can kill Mattelli, Pope arrives, shooting and finally killing Harris. Shevvy sets up his sniper gun on a mount and then shoots Mattelli. Mattelli falls into Pope's hands and dies."
tt0068182,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Biography', 'Drama', 'History']","Opening titles lay out the background of the story. After the conquest and plundering of the Inca Empire by Spain, natives invented the legend of El Dorado, supposedly situated in the headwaters of the Amazon. In 1560 a Spanish expedition set off from Peru. This is the story of the expedition based on the surviving diary of the monk Gaspar de Carvajal.As the film opens a narrator informs us that it is the 25th of December. The expedition has just passed the final peak of the Andes Mountains and is afforded its first glimpse at the jungle. We see hundreds descending into the Amazonian jungle- Spaniards in full armor, ladies in courtly dress, a monk, and hundreds of enslaved Indians carrying food, cannons, sedans and other supplies. The expedition reaches the bottom of the mountains. While many rest, Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) and Gonzalo Pizarro (Alejandro Repullés) stand looking at the river and discuss what faces them. Aguirre maintains that no one can conquer that river, but Pizarro believes that their journey will be easier from this point forward. Aguirre says, No, from here we are all going under. We see only the raging river for nearly a minute.Their break is not long. The group quickly begins their trek through the jungle. They begin to make their way through the jungle. On his horse, Pizarro struggles to cut through the branches with his sword; Indians struggle to carry the cannon, sedan and other goods. As they struggle in the mud the Indians are accosted by Aguirre for nearly dropping the sedan carrying one of the lady travelers. The narrator states that the Indians are useless as leaders and are dropping off like flies because of colds caused by the dramatic climate changes. The expedition stops and sets up camp near the river. Pizarro delivers a speech to the entire group. They cannot continue like this- the terrain is too difficult, rations are almost depleted, and they cannot hope of finding a populated area for a long time. As such he has changed his plan. Rafts will be built and manned by 40 men- these men will seek food, information about hostile Indians, and directions to El Dorado. They will have one week to return. If they don't return, they will be assumed dead, and the remainder of the expedition will march back the way they came. Don Pedro de Ursua (Ruy Guerra) will be in charge of the group. His mistress Donna Inez (Helena Rojo) will accompany him. Don Lope de Aguirre will be second in command, his daughter will accompany him. Brother Gaspar de Carvajal (Del Negro) will go to take the word of God to the pagans, and Don Fernando (Peter Berling) will represent the royal house of Spain. Pizarro says no one who wasn't selected should feel rejected.The group sets off on three rafts; each raft is rowed by Indians. The Spanish cast wary looks as they can hear only the raging river and the calls of the birds in the jungle surrounding them. One of the rafts gets stuck in an eddy on the other side of the river. As they are swept about in continuous circles, the remaining two rafts land on the other side of the river. They watch, clustered in a group, shouting and gesturing at the other group. Their advice, however, cannot be heard.Ursua and Aguirre discuss the trapped men. Ursua wants to help the men, but Aguirre disagrees. He does not want to stop to help them. Ursua maintains that he is still the one giving orders. As Ursua walks away Aguirre softly says, Is that so?Ursua walks over to Armando, one of the only men who will stay loyal to him, and instructs him to form a rescue party. He is to take as many men and supplies as he needs and cross the river to retrieve the trapped party. The newly formed rescue group ventures into the jungle to find a point where they can cross the river. The remaining men begin to set up camp, putting up coverings made from trees they've cut down; the women relax, and the horse gets water. Darkness falls and the group is gathered around a campfire. They discuss their trapped comrades. Several shots sound. One asks if they are being signaled, another mentions that perhaps it is a battle.Morning comes and the trapped men are dead. The river is calm now and several of the men, led by the monk, venture curiously into the river. The rescue party has just arrived and looks down at the raft, now full of only dead bodies. One notes that three men are missing- two Indians and a Spaniard. Armando directs the rescue party to return to the main body. Be wary of the Indians, he warns, the jungle is infested. One man in the party lags a few feet behind the others. His foot is caught in a trap and he is silently swept up into a tree. A comrade turns to look for him, and retraces his steps. Blood drops onto his helmet and the leaf in front of him. He looks up, and is terror struck. He turns to catch up with the group and runs screaming, Indians! Help, Help!At the camp Aguirre is unnoticed by Carvajal and Ursua as they walk past. They discuss the burial of the murdered men. Carvajal thinks the men must be buried according to a proper Christian burial. Ursua agrees and allows him to begin preparations for the ceremony. The men have passed. Aguirre calls over Perucho, one of his devotees, and mentions that the cannon is looking rusty. Perucho nods and walks over to the aforementioned cannon. Whispering La, la, la, la, he blows on a ashy light and looks around. Seeing no one he shifts the cannon slightly and ignites it. The raft and the men who were left on it are blown to bits.Inez sits halfway in her sedan and addresses Ursua. She reminds him that he knows who is responsible, and if he is allowed to get away with this- what's next? Ursua nods, but tells her they have bigger problems- Indians- theyre everywhere and no one wants to die like the men on the raft. Aguirre wouldn't rebel against the Spanish crown. Inez is skeptical and reminds him that they are no longer in Castile.Aguirre speaks with his daughter Flores. He found a tiny sloth and shares it with her. It is a little animal that sleeps the entire day.Two Spaniards sleep on rocks at the rivers edge. One awakens with a start to realize that the river has flooded and wakes up his comrade. The narrator begins: the river flooded fifteen feet last night. The rafts were swept away. Men begin scouting wood to build new rafts. Iron is collected to forge nails to help hold it together. Aguirre pulls a lifeless Indian from the water and drops him shortly thereafter. Guzman shakes an Indian, demanding an answer- will he run away if Guzman loosens his chains? He gets no answer from the silent slave. A man walks by. Guzman turns his attention to the passerby and accuses him of taking his pot. The black slave advises a conquistador not to use a tree for the raft. His advice is rejected- the advisee is afraid to venture further into the hostile jungle.
As this goes on, Ursua emerges. He asks one man what he is doing, but receives no answer. Another only responds with, everyone is doing it. No one will tell him who ordered them to begin building a raft. Ursua sees Aguirre but says nothing to him. The women observe the men as they work. Flores asks Inez, What does it all mean? Inez tells her to be quiet. It's her father's fault.The men are gathered around Ursua. Ursua speaks: He has decided that they will return to Pizarro. Aguirre is heard in the background, It is not my habit to retreat. Ursua continues: They must hike because the current is too strong. Another declares the plan is suicide- they'll all be killed by Indians! Ursua ignores the interjection- they will return to Pizarro, whatever the cost. Aguirre begins again, Shit on Pizarro- we can conquer without him. Perucho reminds them that this is why they built the rafts this morning. Aguirre calls Cortez to their attention. The great Spanish conquerer only became so renowned because he disregarded his orders. Ursua repeatedly orders Silence! But to no avail. He orders Aguirre put in chains, but is shot in the abdomen. Inez rushes to his side. His loyal Armando draws a sword, but he too is shot. Aguirre orders silence asking if anyone else wishes to join Ursua and Armando. Everyone stands silently. One begins to speak wondering what will happen now? Perhaps there are waterfalls downriver, questions another. What does it matter so long as they get closer to El Dorado, interjects another. Another man notices Ursuas fist is clenched. Surely Ursua will be killed, he mentions, but no one is willing to help him.An Indian plays a flute while Aguirre watches him.Armando is confined to chains in a jail constructed out of tree branches. Inez comforts Ursua.Monk Caspar de Carvajal sits on a rock at the river's edge. Inez approaches him. He is their last hope; Aguirre will kill Ursua and Armando. Carvajal can only console her a little- God is always on the side of the strong.Aguirre approaches Armando's cell. We want you on our side. We need men like you. He circles the cell, thwarting Armando's attempts to avoid his gaze. Think about it- but not too long. Aguirre gathers the men for a speech. They've rid themselves of the troublemakers, now it is time to elect a leader. The choice is clear- Don Fernando de Guzman. Guzman appears confused by the nomination. Perucho immediately set forth a formal proposal among the group to elect Guzman. Aguirre glares at each of the men until they reluctantly raise their hands and the decision is unanimous. Perucho elects Aguirre to remain second in command, the group agrees.Balthasar, one of the Indian slaves, speaks with Flores. He has survived plagues and floods, but what the Spanish have done to him is far worse. They named him Balthasar, his name was Runo Rimac. He was a prince before, and no one could look him in the eye. Now he is a slave like his people were. He feels sorry for Flores though, because there is no escape from this. The men sit and eat. Inez brings Armando some food to eat in his cell. While feeding him through the bars of his jail, Perucho hovers around them taunting them with a steady, la, la, la, la, la. Armando inquires quietly about how Ursua is doing. Inez does not reply.Aguirre rises to address the group again. Their position must be made legal. He orders Gaspar de Carvajal to read a document. Gaspar reads- The article addresses the king. Until yesterday these men considered themselves in the king's service. Fate, Gods Help, and their own work carried them down the river, but now they are 200 miles from Pizarro. Now they will share none of the fruits of their conquest with the Spanish crown. We Rebel Until Death. May our hands perish and our tongues dry up if this is not so. The house of Habsburg is overthrown and Phillip the Second is dethroned. By this declaration you are annihilated. Guzman is king of El Dorado. God Bless.Aguirre seizes the document from Carvajal. He declares that fortune smiles on the brave and spits on the coward. The reluctant King Guzman is shown his throne- merely two pieces of wood with a bit of velvet thrown over it. Scoffing, he asks if this is really to be his throne. Aguirre assures him it is as he forcibly seats him in it. Guzman sits there and begins to tear up. Aguirre inspects the jail cell. Armando has escaped, and the guard is dead.Guzman sits on a bench in the river, washed and massaged by two men. Aguirre comes up behind him and warns that so long as Ursua lives, his life will be in danger. Ursua still has sympathizers within the group. Guzman declares that so long as he is king, law will prevail. There should be a trial. Fine, hisses Aguirre. Try him. Then kill him.Gaspar de Carvajal leads the trial. Perucho testifies that Ursua will say nothing. No one can take what is clenched in his fist, to do so they would have to cut off his hand. Balthasar testifies that he and other Indians have received money from Ursua; Okello testifies that he has received money as well though he is not really sure as to why. Ursua is called on for a defense. Defiant, however, he says nothing. Inez sits next to him. She rises to speak. Back in Spain they paid their servant. Surely they should do the same here, even if they are Indians. Carvajal dismisses her calling her a confused child, no one will hold her testimony against her.Carvajal speaks. He declares that Ursua has been found guilty of treason and will be sentenced to death. Guzman, sitting behind him on a throne confirms the verdict and a confident Aguirre begins to walk away. He turns around, eyes wide and raging, as Guzman begins speaking again. Today is the anniversary of the last moor leaving Spain. He will grant Ursua clemency, but he forfeits all rights as a citizen. His portion will be divided- half for the church, half among the best soldiers. The following day the party continues down the river on their newly built raft. Ursua reclines by Inez, he still refuses to speak, and has begun to lose his vision. It's noon and the party spots a fire on the banks of the river. A village is burning. Aguirre sets up an attack. Okello, the black slave, is stripped save for a loin cloth, so he can scare the Indians. The group lands and, prodded by the Spaniards behind him, Okello reluctantly runs in front of them into the village. The men grab at fruit, and are admonished- they must conquer. King Guzman sits on the edge of a platform eating ripe fruit. As they discover a bucket with human skulls, and a mummy, they realize they are in a village where cannibals lived. Grabbing what little food they can, the disturbed group quickly returns to the raft and begins again to venture down the river.The river comes to a near standstill. Weary adventurers seek refuge under newly built thatched roofs. Inez warns Aguirre as he walks past- She knows his intent to kill Urusa, and God in heaven will punish him for it. Silence falls over the raft as they see Indians on the distant shore. One man is shot and dies. A perturbed Aguirre orders the men to shoot at anything to break the ominous silence. Noting the men are stilled unsettled, Aguirre orders an Indian slave to play the flute for them.Two Indians, a man and a woman, paddle over to the raft in a canoe. The Spaniards are wary of a trap, but pull them up onto the raft. The man explains with Balthasar as a translator that they have long awaited the foretold arrival of the white man with sticks that throw lightning.Guzman listens, but is quickly distracted and focuses only on the gold pendant he rips from the mans neck. They demand to know where the gold came from. The Indian's only answer is that gold is father downriver.
Gaspar de Carvajal steps forward to show the pair a Bible. He holds it up explaining that this is the word of God. He hands it to the man, who takes it and, confused, holds it against his ear. He tells the Spaniards that he hears nothing. Accused of blasphemy, he is killed. Carvajal comments that it is difficult to convert these heathens.Given hope the group begins to dream of the riches of El Dorado. Gold abounds, they have governorships, provinces and Okello even dreams of freedom. While tracing out a map Guzman declares that all the land to the left and to the right is the property of El Dorado. Every day they drift his kingdom grows larger.Okello fixes dinner for Guzman- fish stuffed with fruits and cooked over a fire. Upon being served, Guzman whines that he has no salt and holds out his cup as if expecting wine at a fine dinner. The men behind him however, are counting out the last grains they have. Today there are only ten grains per man. The horse is frightened and begins to thrash around kicking and stomping. Angry that his meal was disturbed, Guzman orders the horse off the raft. The men shove the horse off of the raft and ignore its attempt to get back on. The horse swims to the bank and stands on land the raft floats away. Carvajal muses with Perucho, that Guzman is a dead man. The sight of a horse could scare away armies of Indians, and the horse was meat for a week. Shortly thereafter Guzman is found dead just outside the raft's outhouse.Ursuas fate is sealed by Guzman's death. He is taken by Perucho and two others inland via canoe. Here, they find a tree barely able to hold his weight on its spindly branches, hoist him up so they can tie the rope down, and let him hang. Perucho sits on a branch below him and eats while reciting nonsense, waiting for Ursua to die.With all of its remaining members on board the raft keep moving slowly down the river. They approach a new group of Indians who, according to Balthasars translation, shout, Meat, Meat! Meat is floating by! As the Spaniards land, arrows fly. Spaniards shoot at Indians and light the village on fire. Starving men are soon distracted and begin to lick up salt from the ground. Suddenly a beautifully adorned Inez emerges and walks calmly and alone into the jungle. The attack is complete, and Perucho reports to Aguirre. They followed Inez's tracks a half mile into the jungle but saw neither her nor the Indians. The men accompanying him panicked at the silence and returned to the camp. As he reports a voice comes from the background. A man is plotting to return to Pizarro. He has counted the bends in the river and will travel by night and hide by day to avoid the Indians. Aguirre hears the traitor and comments to Perucho that the man speaking is a head taller than himself, and that should soon change. Perucho walks quietly over and slices the oblivious man's head off mid-sentence. Aguirre speaks- he is the greatest traitor, there will be no greater. The earth bows to his will. Anyone who attempts to leave will die. The group returns to the raft to continue downstream. As they float along, two more men are picked off by the arrows of Indians.Gaspar de Carvajal speaks with Aguirre about morale. They see nothing but death but never see their enemy. Perhaps even El Dorado is an illusion. Aguirre, however, will not have it. Mexico was no illusion, and if they give up then someone else will come along later and take it. Power and Fame are riches as well. Carvajal muses that Aguirre is leading them to their destruction- perhaps even doing so intentionally.Weeks later unbearable suffering is rampant among the men. Many are struck with fever and hallucinations due to hunger and illness. Okello sees a ship with sails in a tree. Carvajal dismisses this as a hallucination. Aguirre, however, is convinced that they will retrieve the ship and go to the Atlantic. Carvajal dares to defy him- the men are sick and near dying. They will not go with Aguirre. Okello is struck by an arrow, then Carvajal. They believe, however, that these are illusions and don't move. Flores walks to the edge of the raft and is struck by an arrow as she looks into the trees in front of her. Aguirre walks over and takes her in his arms. She dies quietly and motionless in Aguirres arms.Monkeys suddenly appear all over the raft and Aguirre follows them around the raft. He speaks- He will reach the Atlantic, take Trinidad from Spain, and Mexico from Cortez. They will have all of New Spain. He will marry his own daughter and found a pure dynasty. They will rule the entire continent together and endure. The film closes with Aguirre being the only person clearly alive. The camera circles him until the credits roll."

Soon after, a mother with 2 children and a baby are seen moving out of the house.Its now a dark early Christmas evening and a smartly dressed old man is weaving his way through the market in Camden Town, noticeably shying away from a lit brazier. He knocks on the door of a dingy basement flat to which this family has now moved. He quickly explains he is not a rent collector but a partner in a firm of solicitors Blunden, Blunden, Claverton and a 4th member he cannot remember, who are seeking a reliable person to act as caretaker to a property in the firms charge. He is reluctant to go into details other than its a bit remote, but there is a rent-free caretakers cottage and the duties would be light. Saddled with little money other than a widow's pension and large debts, the mother (Mrs Allen) is tempted. The old man asks the 2 children Lucy (Lynn Frederick) and James (Garry Miller) if they would be afraid if they saw ghosts - say of children their age or an old man such as himself. He warns them they will hear tales about the house but when the time comes, they will know what to do.When the family accept his proposal, he visibly brightens and outside disappears mysteriously, saying to Lucy and James ""We 3 Kings of Orient are my dears"".Next day the family present themselves at the solicitors address. The clerk is puzzled as the job had not yet been advertised but shows Mrs Allen in to the partner Mr Claverton. Whilst waiting for their mother, Lucy and Tom see a picture of their visitor - Mr Blunden. The clerk retorts that is a picture of the current Mr Blunden's great grandfather who died 100 years ago and doubted if they had seen even the current Mr Blunden who was bedridden and senile.Mr Claverton delightedly offers the post to Mrs Allen and soon the family is travelling by bus to Langley Park, Buckinghamshire. The house proves to be derelict and overgrown and the cottage very sparse. They go to bed that night wondering what they have done.Next morning Lucy explores the house which has been extensively damaged. She hears childrens voices upstairs but is then startled by the presence of Elsie Tucker the daily cleaner. She mysteriously tells Lucy that the voices she hears are only kiddies.The following day the sun is shining and Lucy is happily picking flowers when out of a sudden mist she sees two figures approaching. She initially flees to find James but both return in time for the approach of two children dressed in old clothes. The ghost children, called Sara and Georgie, are pleased that Lucy and James have not run away and Sara recounts their story. Their parents had tragically died in a carriage accident in 1818. Their father's half brother Uncle Bertie, who lived in London, became their guardian as had the family solicitor Mr Blunden. Uncle Bertie, despite appearances, was short of money and often returned to Langley Park to steal and pawn the family silver. He subsequently married Bella, a simple chorus girl, and with her parents moved into Langley Park. He admitted to his new mother-in-law Mrs Wickens (Diana Dors) that he was hopelessly embarrassed financially. He explained that 10 year old Master Georgie was the only member of his family with money - £30,000 which was held in trust for him until he was 21. Uncle Bertie and Bella would only inherit this money if Georgie died before then.
Appalled at this revelation, Mrs Wickens assumed the role of housekeeper and sacked most of the staff at Langley Park as part of an economy drive. Mrs Wickens then got the idea that if the children caught their death of cold, her Bella would be in the money. She fed Sara and Georgie only on scraps and ordered the remaining servant - the timid Meakins - to make sure when she took their food up to their room that their window was left open during the cold nights. However Tom the gardeners son was very fond of Sara and used to climb up the drainpipe to their bedroom to provide them with newspaper to go under their bedding to help keep them warm and then close the window on his way downSome months passed until one night Sara and Georgie overheard the frustrated Mrs Wickens saying it was taking too long and a quick accident was now required. Sara burst in on Uncle Bertie to tell him and also wrote to Mr Blunden explaining their plight but neither believed her and ordered Mrs Wickens to prevent them running away at all costs by locking their window and bedroom door.That following night Georgie saw a message appearing on the window which said ""look in library"". Meakin had forgotten to lock the door so they crept down to the dusty old library. They saw an arrow drawn in the dust pointing to a book which contained a single sheet headed ""A charm to move the wheel of time"". It contained a recipe for which they had found the necessary herbs in the garden to concoct a potion, trying it first on the unsuspecting Mrs Wickens to make sure it wasn't poisonous. They used the potion to travel forward in time to try and get help and now Lucy and James are the first to stay and listen to their story. Their own potion is wearing off but before they leave Sara begs Lucy and James for their help and gives them the recipe for making it so they could travel back with her in future.The next day the children are in church when James gets Lucy to leave with him early to search the graveyard. Lucy refuses to help but James finds a grave for Sara and George Latimer dated April 21st 1818 ie 100 years ago tomorrow. They are startled by the sexton who says he's been there 40 years and knows the stories of each grave. He says a fire started in the library while the children lay in their beds and nobody could get to them to save them. He showed them another unmarked grave which his grandfather had told him belonged to the gardener's son, trying to save them by climbing up the drainpipe but he had fallen to his death.He said one of the guardians had left for London but his carriage had broken down. When he saw the flames he rode back to no avail saying over and over again that he was too late and subsequently died of a broken heart.Lucy and James now brew up the potion and meet Sara in the garden who says Georgie has been locked in the cellar. She begs them to return with her. Mr Blunden also appears and says he has a chance to put things right, promising them he will guard them and no harm will come to them.Lucy and James take the potion and travel back to 1818. They meet Tom who excitedly reckons they have come from America - the new world - where one day he hopes to go. They quickly realise no adults can see them, the exception being Bella who has the mind of a child. They spook her into getting her mother to release Georgie from the cellar.That night the 4 children eavesdrop on a dinner involving the Mr and Mrs Wickens, Uncle Bertie and Bella and Mr Blunden. As Mr Blunden leaves with Uncle Bertie, Sara and Georgie rush down to beg them to stay. The children are carted off by Mrs Wickens and the ghost of Mr Blunden appears to James, telling him to wait until the time comes. Then the ghost Mr Blunden goes down the stairs to be subsumed into the body of the living Mr Blunden.Lucy and James realise the nursery where Sara and Georgie sleep is above the library where the fire will start. They try unsuccessfully to get the keys off Mrs Wickens and rush outside to see Mr Wickens carrying a bundle of wood to the fire he has just started outside the library. Lucy waits for Tom who climbs the drainpipe to rescue Sara and Georgie, while James goes for an axe to break down the locked bedroom door. Mr Wickens sees Tom and tries to pull down the drainpipe but Lucy sufficiently distracts Mr Wickens to enable James to smash down the bedroom door and then smash the window locks to enable Tom to clamber in to safety. They find Sara and Georgie have been drugged but James leads Sara first and then Tom outside to Lucy and safety.James is afraid to go back in to the inferno to rescue Georgie but Mr Blunden appears back on horseback and promises they will go in together and he will protect James. They find Georgie and Mr Blunden pushes James and Georgie to safety before succumbing to the fire saying ""Thank you Thank you"". Georgie stumbles out of the house but theres no sign of James, leaving Lucy screaming for him and crying ""You're always too late Mr Blunden"".Her potion now wears off and shes back in the garden in her own time. She eventually finds an unconscious James lying outside the house and he is taken to his room.Next day being Sunday and with James still unconscious in bed, Lucy is in church when she suddenly decides to search the graveyard. This time there is only a gravestone for Mr Blunden with the inscription ""He gave his life to save the children in his care"" and dated April 21st 1818.As she wanders back home, her mother calls out that James is awake. Lucy tells James what she saw and they laugh with relief that the rescue had been successful.Sometime later a car pulls up and Clutterbuck gets out for a private meeting with their mother. Lucy and James gloomily say goodbye to the house and garden when their mother calls them. Clutterbuck says that Mr Blunden had suddenly got out of his sick bed the previous Thursday and ordered him to find the papers on the marriage of Miss Sara and Master Tom who are now revealed to be great-grandparents of their father. Sara Latimer had married a Tom Mortimer and they had sailed to America. As direct descendants, this makes James and Lucy legal owners of the house and cottage with an annual allowance of £500 for the rest of their lives.Clutterbuck leads them back to the car where he says all will be revealed. Inside is Mr Blunden and in reply to the childrens' question ""which one are you?"" says ""We 3 Kings of Orient are"" and gives them a wink.In front of their bemused mother, Lucy and James rush delightedly round the garden before the cast give their farewells."

One morning while the couple lounge at their swimming pool, Bill is horrified to find a live rat in the drain. When a tall black stranger (Yaphet Kotto) appears, Bill and Bernadette conclude that he is an exterminator and explain their predicament. After killing the rat, however, the man refuses to depart, prompting Bill and Bernadette to rightly fear that he is a criminal coming to rob them. Although the man has no weapon, Bill and Bernadette comply with his order to go to the house, where they proudly relate the structure's long Hollywood history. When the man, who introduces himself as 'Bone', rifles through a desk and finds a photo of a handsome young man, the Lennoxes explain it is their son, who is a lieutenant in the army currently serving in Vietnam.Critical of the couple's numerous charge-account debts, Bone demands money, but Bill admits their bank account is empty and many of their bills are overdue. Bone continues to threaten the couple and after hitting Bill in the stomach, forces them to their bedroom, where he discovers a small box under the bed. Opening the box, Bone finds papers revealing that Bill has taken out a loan against the house, as well as another loan against his life insurance policy, both without Bernadette's knowledge. Outraged, Bernadette turns on Bill and as a furious argument ensues between them right in front of their captor. Bone comes upon a checkbook in Bill's name with $5,000.Disgusted by the Lennoxes' bickering, Bone threatens to tie them up together, but Bernadette refuses and Bill offers to go to the bank to retrieve the money. Bone agrees, but insists Bill return in one hour with the money or he will rape and murder Bernadette. As Bill hurries away in his Rolls Royce, Bernadette nervously listens as Bone describes the squalor of his childhood and how he was forced to kill the cockroaches that infested his family's home.A little later at the bank, Bill is disconcerted when a young woman (Jeannie Berlin) begins chatting with him as he waits anxiously in a long line. Once Bill reaches the teller and makes his request, the teller suggests that he take out a loan rather than make a full withdrawal. Abruptly recalling Bernadette's refusal to be tied up with him, Bill leaves without making the withdrawal.At a bar across the street, a woman recognizes Bill from his television advertisements and strikes up a conversation, then offers to pay the bar tab when Bill realizes he has no money.Back at the Lennox home, after Bone demands that Bernadette make him a meal, she admits with embarrassment that she does not cook, as she and Bill dine out frequently. Growing more fearful as the hour quickly slips by, Bernadette makes a full pitcher of cocktails and urges Bone to share it with her.Meanwhile, while walking down Sunset Boulevard, Bill runs into the young woman from the bank and, drawn to her, accompanies her to a grocery store, where she convinces him to steal several items then pays for others using food stamps. Bill then accepts her invitation to lunch at her apartment and purposely avoids looking at his watch.Although Bernadette grows drunk, when Bone tells her the hour is up and he will make good on his threat, she sobers up and struggles furiously as he strips off her bathing suit and throws her on top of the pool table. When Bone does not go through with the rape, however, Bernadette is grateful, then puzzled.Back in town, Bill lunches with the woman, who is surprised when he admits that he does not have a mistress. The woman confides that she was molested by her father when she was a child, then proceeds to seduce Bill by re-enacting her molestation.Back at the Lennox home, Bone admits to Bernadette that he initially embraced the role that society had created for black men as criminals and rapists. The recent shift in cultural and social attitudes on racial relations, however, had affected Bone, who has been unable to recapture the mystique of being the ""Negro Rapist."" Moved by his confession, Bernadette empathizes and says white men have similar difficulties, then sets about seducing Bone. Although initially uncomfortable, Bone eventually gives in. Afterward, Bernadette telephones the bank and is angered to learn that Bill did not make the withdrawal. Fearful that Bill will return with the police, Bone grows anxious to depart, but Bernadette considers Bill's behavior, then tells Bone they should kill him and collect the life insurance.Back in town, Bill flees from the clinging woman and at a phone booth contacts the police to leave an anonymous tip about Bone, but, suspecting the call is a prank, the police hang up on him. Now frightened by the long lapse of time, Bill goes to his advertising agent, Woody (James Lee), to ask for money. Calculating that Bill is at Woody's, Bernadette gives Bone her husband's clothes and drives him into town. On the way, she confesses to Bone that they lied about their son, who is actually languishing in a Spanish prison for attempting to smuggle hash out of Tangiers. Bernadette grows distressed when she can not recall when or why she and Bill made up the lie about their son, and Bone comforts her.Arriving at Woody's, who has refused to lend Bill money, Bernadette and Bone chase Bill, who gets on a bus headed to the beach. Bernadette and Bone follow and threaten Bill throughout the long ride, but confident that the two will not act in front of witnesses, Bill says he will remain on the bus. Later, realizing the bus has emptied of all the passengers, Bill panics and gets off at the beach, pursued by Bone and Bernadette. Bone assures Bill his murder will be quick and painless, but when Bill breaks into a monologue from his advertising, an outraged Bernadette attacks him furiously, beating him unconscious, then smothering him in the sand. Taken aback, Bone attempts to intervene, but Bernadette says she does need him. Ecstatic about having killed Bill, Bernadette looks around moments later and is shocked to find that Bone has disappeared. Suddenly terrified, Bernadette struggles to concoct a story to tell the police that Bill was killed by a large black man, then lapses into despair when she cannot recall why or how she decided to murder her husband."

She dreams of becoming rich and famous, but has a clear drinking problem. She works at the Kit-Kat cabaret, a seedy place with suggestive musical numbers. The Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey), introduces and participates in the risque acts at the cabaret.We see Nazis asking for donations from the club patrons, but the owner throws them out.Sally meets Brian Roberts (Michael York) when he takes a room in a flat she shares with some older people. He is in Berlin to finish his PhD and teach English, but is currently penniless. They become friends, but fairly quickly Sally discovers that Brian has been ""unsuccessful"" with women, and it is implied that he is gay. The two become friends, with Sally doing much of the talking. She is loud, brash, an alcoholic always bumming cigarettes and dreaming of stardom (though her talent is apparent, she sells herself short and assumes a destructive lifestyle). We learn her father is a diplomat, but he misses a meeting with her, and has apparently been absent (if apologetic, but efficient to the point of counting words on telegrams) for much of her life.Through the other tenant's conversations, street shots, musical numbers and and a few seemingly random scenes or inserts in conversations, the growing influence of racist ideas and Nazism is foreshadowed.Brian is fascinated by Sally (she is edgy and outspoken and almost out of control, while he is composed and rational) and their friendship ends up as a sexual affair. However, Sally doesn't want to fall in love with him because she wants to marry big money. One day, while complaining at the laundrette because of problems with the timing of the cleaning of some garments, she bumps into Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem). He helps Sally by translating the attendant's German into English. Sally flirts with him, and he offers her a ride in his limousine. Sally falls dazzled when she notices the luxurious car. They go out (Brian, invited, refuses) and Max buys Sally perfume, a fur coat and treats her to a life of luxury.Meanwhile, Sally and Brian have been setting up one student of Brian's, a wanna-be gigolo who plans on meeting and wedding an ugly but rich woman, Fritz Wendel (Fritz Wepper), with a wealthy heiress, Natalia Landauer (Marisa Berenson). While Fritz was originally after Natalia's money, he finds he has really fallen for her - and she is in love with him. Ironically, it is Sally's bluntly sexual advice (that both seek) that bring them together.Max also buys Brian gifts and finally wins him over--Brian and Sally visit Max at his castle. Max gives them a first-class treatment, and Sally gets completely starry-eyed. However, there, they learn the truth: Max is married, but he and his wife have decided to lead separate lives with many different lovers and sexual adventures on either side, but never breaking up their marriage, as financially that would be an end to their flamboyant living. The three enjoy an evening of decadence.Later, Sally confesses to Brian that she has slept with Max. Brian confesses that he has too.The Nazis are gaining public acceptance and power. Max, Sally and Brian go to a beer garden and a Nazi youth starts singing a ""patriotic"" song; most of the people join in. On the way home, Brian suggests that the growing Nazi threat may not be contained (by people like Max, even). A Nazi gang beats up the club owner in revenge of their previous treatment. One of the acts in the club is a poignant and ironic ""ode"" to anti-Jew sentiment.Natalia finds her beloved dog dead on her door-step. Brian encourages Fritz to propose to her, as he knows she really does love him, and Fritz loves her as a person - not just for her fortune. Fritz says that it won't happen, because he's penniless. Because of the increasingly hostile atmosphere, Natalia rejects Fritz when he finally proposes. She tells him that the marriage can't take place because she is Jewish. Fritz confesses to Natalia that he is Jewish as well, and they get married in a traditional ceremony immediately.Max sends a note to Sally and Brian, saying that he has to leave the country on ""family business"". He includes money for each of them. Soon, she feels gloomy, and tells Brian that she is pregnant, but doesn't know who the father is. It could be Max or Brian's... She considers an abortion, but Brian asks her to marry him. He asks her to have the baby and tries to convince her that they could be happy together in spite of not being millionaires. His demeanor and expression, however, suggests that he is not pleased with this prospect, as Sally says that she'll think about it. It's implied through scenes of their past decadence, that, if she has a baby, she'll give up the only life she knows, nor ever never be able to become a star or marry a rich man.The next thing Brian notices is that Sally hasn't got the fur coat anymore. Brian realizes that she's given it to the doctor as payment for the abortion. Their relationship is over. Returning to his rational self and seeing Sally for who she is, and the rise of Nazism, he decides to return home.Brian and Sally head to the train station so Brian can return to England. Sally stays behind to keep up her performances at the club. She sings her final ode to fatalism and decadence, ""Cabaret"", and the MC closes the show. The atmosphere is not joyous anymore and Nazis are seen among the patrons in the warped mirror of the sax."

tt0068408,"['Action', 'SciFi']","In 1983 (several years after the end of 'Escape from the Planet of the Apes'), an interstellar disease kills the world's cats and dogs, leaving humans with no pet animals. To replace them, humans began keeping monkeys and apes as household pets. In time, humans notice the apes' capacity to learn and adapt; thus they train them to perform menial household tasks. By 1991, the former United States of America and most of the North American continent has become an oppressive and fascist police superstate culture of uniformed classes and castes, based upon ape slave labor. The different apes are divided into similar caste systems; gorillas wear red jumpsuits; chimpanzees wear green jumpsuits; and orangutans wear orange jumpsuits.In the opening scene, Armando (Ricardo Montalbán) and Caesar (Roddy McDowall), a young chimpanzee horseback rider in Armando's circus, visit a large city to distribute flyers advertising the circus' arrival to town. Armando warns the chimpanzee to be careful; should anyone learn his identity as the child of the late Cornelius and Zira, it would mean their deaths. Walking the streets, they see apes cleaning streets, delivering packages, et cetera, and are shocked by what is done to disobedient apes. Seeing an ape being beaten and drugged by black-uniformed neo-Gestapo police units, Caesar shouts: ""Lousy human bastards!"". Quickly, Armando takes responsibility for the exclamation, explaining to the policemen that it was he who shouted, not his chimpanzee. The surrounding crowd become agitated, and Caesar runs away.Hiding in a stairway, Armando says he will go to the authorities and settle the matter by bluffing. Meantime, Caesar must hide among his own kind (in a cage of orangutans from Borneo), and soon finds himself being trained for slavery through violent conditioning. He then is sold at auction to the neo-Fascist Governor Breck (Don Murray). Gov. Breck allows the ape to name himself by randomly pointing to a word in a book handed to him and the chimpanzee's finger rests upon the name Caesar, as if by chance (but the audience knows that the ape can read and searched for the name). Caesar is then put to work by Gov. Breck's chief aide, the African-American MacDonald (Hari Rhodes), who sympathizes with the apes to the thinly veiled disgust of his boss, and eventually deduces Casear's true identity.Meanwhile, Armando is being interrogated by Inspector Kolp (Severn Darden), who suspects his ""circus ape"" is the child of the two civilized apes from the future back in 1973. Kolp's assistant puts Armando under an authenticator machine that psychologically forces people to be truthful. Rather than confessing, Armando fights the guards and commits suicide by jumping to his death through a window. Learning of the death of the only human he loved, Caesar loses faith in human kindness and begins plotting a simian rebellion.Secretly, Caesar teaches the combat arts to the other apes and has them gather weapons. Meanwhile, Gov. Breck learns from Inspector Kolp that the manifest of the vessel that delivered Caesar lists no chimpanzees. Suspecting Caesar is the ape the secret police are hunting, Breck's men arrest Caesar and electrically torture him until he speaks, thus betraying his identity. Hearing the confession, Breck orders Caesar's immediate death. Caesar survives his execution because MacDonald, feigning over-sensitivity to torture, reduces the electrical power of the machine. Once Gov. Breck leaves, Caesar kills the torturer and escapes.Caesar leads an ape revolt against Ape Management and a violent and climatic 25-minute battle begins. The apes are victorious after killing most of the riot police. After bursting into Gov. Breck's command post and killing most of the personnel, Caesar has Breck marched out to be executed in the courtyard. MacDonald appeals to Caesar's humanity to show mercy to his former persecutor. Caesar ignores him, and in a rage declares:""Where there is fire, there is smoke. And in that smoke, from this day forward, my people will crouch, and conspire, and plot, and plan for the inevitable day of Man's downfall. The day when he finally and self-destructively turns his weapons against his own kind. The day of the writing in the sky, when your cities lie buried under radioactive rubble! When the sea is a dead sea, and the land is a wasteland out of which I will lead my people from their captivity! And we will build our own cities, in which there will be no place for humans except to serve our ends! And we shall found our own armies, our own religion, our own dynasty! And that day is upon you NOW!""However, as the apes raise their rifles to beat Breck to death, Lisa (Natalie Trundy), Caesar's beloved and later wife, voices her objection; ""NO!"" other than Caesar, she is the first ape to speak. Caesar reconsiders and orders the apes to lower their weapons, saying:""But now... now we will put away our hatred. Now we will put down our weapons. We have passed through the night of the fires, and those who were our masters are now our servants. And we, who are not human, can afford to be humane. Destiny is the will of God, and if it is mans destiny to be dominated, it is Gods will that he be dominated with compassion, and understanding. So, cast out your vengeance.

She interrupts the kissing session again when she sees a knife being swung. Enrico, thinking she just wants an excuse to stop, angrily rows the boat to shore. Enrico and Elizabeth leave, and a pen is dropped. Enrico, at home with his wife, Herta (Karin Baal), hears a radio report of a murdered girl. On his way to school where he works as a teacher, Enrico stops by the crime scene. Inspector Barth (Joachim Fuchsberger) is at the school with the headmaster Mr. Leach (Rainer Penkert) and some teachers with Enrico walks in late. Enrico leaves, passes by a classroom, and sees Elizabeth (she's a student). He goes to gym class and tells his students that their classmate Hilda has been killed.Later, Enrico asks Elizabeth what she saw then they were together. She says she saw a shadow like a man and ""something funny"". Enrico asks her not to go to the police, for fear that they will ask Elizabeth who she was with. At home, an irate Herta asks Enrico where he was that morning (he had lied by saying that his car and broken down). She shows him the front page of the newspaper, with a photograph of the crime scene and Enrico pictured in the background. Inspector Barth talks to Enrico and asks him how he found such a obscure local in such a short time. Barth is shown a pen that was found on the victim's dress, and he talks to Hilda's parents, who say that their daughter went to confession the afternoon she was killed.Enrico calls Elizabeth at home and gives her an address for a place to meet. She tells her uncle that she is going to study with Brenda. She rides her bicycle and is followed by someone in a car. Enrico lets Elizabeth into a small apartment and two lovers kiss. Someone calls from a pay phone and hangs up.Some time later, Enrico is back at home grading test papers, and Herta asks him if he had sex with Hilda. The inspector arrives at the front door, and he slyly places Enrico's pen on the table. Enrico sees it. Herta leaves the room, and Barth states his belief that Enrico was a witness. The teacher admits to being there with Elizabeth and says she claims to have seen the killer.Janet (Pilar Castel) is at home with the maid when a man, saying he is Helen's father, calls and says that Helen needs to borrow Janet's Italian book.

Janet is dragged out of the car and stabbed to death.Elizabeth wakes up in bed, thinks back to Hilda running and calls Enrico. Elizabeth runs to her car when Enrico arrives and tells him she remembers that the killer wore a black habit, like a priest. The next day, Elizabeth tells Mr. Bascombe she knows something about Hilda's murder. He leads her to a room of teachers (including Enrico) where she tells of the priest-like pursuer. Afterwards, Enrico thanks the girl for leaving him out of the story. Later, the killer walks into Enrico's apartment and takes the needle off of the record that is playing. Elizabeth is attacked and drowned in the bathtub while taking a bath. Outside, a bearded man sees the killer run away.Enrico is arrested for Elizabeth's murder, and Barth interrogates the other teachers at the school. At the police station, Barth receives the autopsy report that hair was found under Elizabeth's fingernails which turned out to be dead hair. The report also says that Elizabeth was not sexually assaulted and was in fact a virgin. The bearded man is brought in for questioning and later looks at a line-up of priests and says that the man he saw running away from the building had a beard. Barth is told that, because of the dead hair, it was probably a false beard.Barth tells Herta that Enrico did not kill anyone and that Elizabeth was a virgin, and the teacher seems happy. Enrico says he wants to find out who killed Elizabeth, and Herta offers to help. In Herta's class, Barth asks the girls if they know a bearded priest.

She tells Enrico about the society and says that Hilda and Janet once dated university students, and she has a name.Enrico goes to see Phillip and asks him about Hilda and Janet; he talks about the girls hanging out with him and his friends. He says that, after a while, they no longer had sex with boys after what happened to Solange, a girl who used to go to the school and has suddenly disappeared.At the funeral for Elizabeth and Janet, a man hands something to Helen, who passes it on to Brenda.

Enrico picks up his mail and drops Brenda's note. The killer calls and suggests he take a vacation or he will not see ""her"" again. Enrico calls the rental agents, but the offices are closed.Downstairs, Enrico is handed the fallen note, with the name Ruth Holden written on it. Enrico goes to her place and finds a dead dog, a bloody shovel, and Ruth dead with a sickle in her neck.Herta asks Helen and Brenda if they know Ruth, but they respond negatively. The inspector stops them and says that Brenda's mother told him Ruth was the girl's maid. Brenda says she forgot the woman's real name.Enrico, lying in the sun with Herta, says he thinks that the killer dressed as a priest and confessed the girls. A taciturn, teenage girl (Camille Keaton) stands near the couple and runs away and a woman calls after her: ""Solange!""The killer phones Brenda and tells her to go somewhere, and the cops (listening in) set up a trap for the killer at a carnival.

Enrico, Barth, and Herta go to Bascombe's house and the inspector sees a green pin by a photograph of Solange.

Peter Cushing plays a scientist who begins to believe that a skeleton he has brought back from New Guinea may be infused with evil. Worried that his family will be punished by this malevolent being, he scurries the pile of bones away. Unfortunately, his nefarious brother has other plans for the skeletal find.
-Karen NadeauProfessor Emmanual Hildern returns from New Guinea with a skeleton which he believes will revolutionize mankind's theory of evolution, and perhaps win him the coveted Richter Prize. While having breakfast with his daughter, Penelope, Hildern reads a letter from his half-brother, James, which informs him that his wife, Marguerite, has died in James lunatic asylum. Hildern keeps this from Penelope, who believes that her mother died many years earlier. Hildern visits James, and questions him as to whether Marguerite's illness could be hereditary, and thus Penelope be at risk. James informs his brother that he has written a manuscript on that exact subject which he intends to submit for the Richter Prize. He also tells Hildern that he will no longer finance his expeditions. Hildern begins to clean the skeleton, but when he washes one of its fingers, the bones regrow a fleshy covering. Hildern severs the finger and keeps it in a jar. His books contain a New Guinean legend of an evil being buried in the earth which will come to life when it becomes wet. Hildern and his assistant, Wardelow, begin to experiment on the finger. They find that its blood contains strange black cells that attack and consume the cells in normal blood. Hildern hopes to produce a vaccine against Evil to protect mankind. He prepares a serum and inoculates a monkey, whose blood cells later seem protected against the evil black cells. Meanwhile, Penelope has stolen Hilderns keys and gone into her mothers old room, which she was forbidden ever to enter. There she learns that Marguerite was a Folies Bergere dancer, that she went insane, and was institutionalized. Hildern catches her; Penelope becomes hysterical. Terrified that he is seeing the seeds of her mothers illness in her, Hildern injects Penelope with his serum, hoping to protect her against insanity. Later that night, Wardelow finds that the experimental monkey has gone berserk, broken out of its cage, and wrecked part of the laboratory. Hildern rushes upstairs to his daughter, but Penelope has gone...."

Rogers (Norman Rossington) tells him about the history of the London Underground, particularly the Victorian railway workers who constructed the tunnels under dire conditions, and an urban legend that a group of descendants who survived an 1892 cave-in still live below ground in an abandoned section of the tunnels.Meanwhile, one of the last surviving members of a family of these railway workers (Hugh Armstrong) watches his sick, pregnant, female companion (June Turner) die; they have survived since birth in the underground by resorting to cannibalism of the railway patrons.

tt0068473,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","Atlanta businessmen Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Ed (Jon Voight), Bobby (Ned Beatty), and Drew (Ronny Cox) decide to canoe down the fictional Cahulawassee River in the remote Georgia wilderness, expecting to have fun and see the glory of nature before the river valley is flooded over by the upcoming construction of a dam and lake. Lewis, an experienced outdoors-man, is the de facto leader. Ed is also a veteran of several trips but lacks Lewis' machismo. Bobby and Drew are canoeing novices.From the start, it is clear the four are aliens in this unknown locale. The redneck locals are crude, crass, uneducated, unsophisticated and unimpressed with the presence of outsiders. Drew briefly connects with a local mentally-challenged banjo-playing boy by joining him in an impromptu bluegrass jam (the 'Dueling Banjos'). But when the song ends, the boy turns away without saying anything, refusing Drew's handshake. The four ""city boys"", as they are called by one of the unfriendly locals, exhibit a slightly condescending attitude toward the locals; Bobby, in particular, is patronizing toward them. Nevertheless, Lewis manages to negotiate with a family of local mechanics to drive their vehicles to a town downriver, where they will pick them up in three days. Afterward, the four get into their two canoes, Lewis with Bobby and Ed with Drew, and paddle off.The men spend the day canoeing down the river and encounter some rapids and rough water before camping by the riverside at night. Shortly before they retire for the night, Lewis tells the others to be quiet and disappears into the dark woods to investigate a sound he heard. He returns a few minutes later and says that he didn't find anything. When asked whether he heard ""something or someone,"" he tells them he doesn't know.The next morning, Ed wakes first, and heads into the woods with his hunting bow. He sees a deer, experiencing ""buck fever"", unable to keep his aim straight and kill the deer. He fires and misses. He returns as the others are finishing breakfast and loading the canoes. Lewis tells Ed to take Bobby and they get away first. Lewis says that he and Drew will catch up.After a while, Bobby and Ed pull off to the side to wait, and encounter a pair of unkempt hillbillies emerging from the woods; one toothless (Herbert 'Cowboy Coward), and one wielding a shotgun (Bill McKinney). The hillbillies are mildly hostile at first. Bobby speculates that they have a whiskey still hidden in the woods and amicably offers to buy some, but the hillbillies immediately become angry, and are not moved by Bobby's sarcastic comment. The two hillbillies tie Ed to a tree with his belt around his throat and force Bobby at gunpoint to strip naked. The lead hillbilly chases after and physically harasses Bobby as he tries to escape. Bobby's ear is twisted to bring him to his hands and knees, and he is then ordered to ""squeal like a pig"". Ed is guarded by the toothless hillbilly, helpless as the other hillbilly violently sodomizes Bobby.The second hillbilly comments on Ed's ""pretty mouth"" and releases Ed and tells him to get on his knees. Ed notices Lewis sneaking up behind them through the trees with an arrow drawn. Lewis shoots and kills Bobby's rapist with an arrow through his back, as the toothless hillbilly is disarmed by Ed and quickly escapes into the woods. Lewis and Drew begin to argue with each other about whether to inform the authorities. While Drew wants to find a phone to call the police to report this, Lewis argues that they all would be arrested and not receive a fair trial, as he claims that the entire local hillbilly population are related to one another. They would be put on trial in a small town courthouse and that the judge and entire jury would be comprised of ""the dead man's friends and relatives"". Likewise, Bobby does not want the story of his rape to become public. Lewis tells them that since the entire area will be flooded by a lake soon, the body would never be found, and that the escaped hillbilly could not possibly risk informing the police on them, since he had participated in the assault. Lewis suggests a democratic vote and Ed and Bobby side with Lewis and the recommendation to bury the dead hillbilly's body and continue as though nothing had happened. When the valley is flooded, no one will ever find the body. During the grave digging, Drew is obviously upset with the decision.After having buried the body, the four make a run for it downriver. Soon, disaster strikes as the canoes reach a dangerous stretch of rapids. In the lead canoe, Ed repeatedly asks Drew to don his life jacket, but an unnerved Drew ignores him without a word of explanation. As Drew and Ed reach the rapids, a faint gunshot is heard and Drew falls forward into the river.After Drew disappears into the river, Ed loses control of his canoe and both canoes collide on the rocks, spilling Lewis, Bobby, and Ed into the river. Ed and Drew's wooden canoe breaks in half while Lewis and Bobby's metal canoe remains intact. The three tumble down the river through the rapids and a water fall. Lewis breaks his right femur and the two others are washed ashore alongside him in a gorge under a massive cliff. The badly-injured Lewis believes the toothless hillbilly shot Drew and is now stalking them.Later that night, under cover of darkness, Ed climbs the nearby rock face in order to dispatch the suspected shooter using his bow, while Bobby stays behind to look after Lewis. Ed reaches the top and hides out until the next morning, when he sees a man standing on the cliff holding a rifle, looking down into the gorge where Lewis and Bobby are hiding. The man appears to be the hillbilly that escaped through the woods.Ed, despite being a champion archer, again freezes in spite of his clear shot. The man notices Ed and fires his rifle as Ed clumsily releases his arrow. Ed falls to the ground in a panic and accidentally stabs himself with another of his arrows. The man stumbles toward Ed and is about to kill him when he drops his rifle and collapses, revealing Ed's arrow protruding through the back of his neck (Ed had in fact hit him after all). Ed suddenly remembers that the hillbilly who tried to assault him had no front teeth, but upon initial examination, this man appears to have all his teeth, but upon closer examination, Ed discovers that his victim has a partial, movable plate for his front teeth.Ed lowers the dead body down the cliff with a rope and climbs down after it. His rope breaks and he and the dead body fall into the river. Ed swims ashore and meets with Bobby and Lewis. Ed asks more than once if Bobby is certain the dead man is the same toothless hillbilly as the one they confronted earlier. Clearly irritated and not completely sure himself, Ed snaps at Bobby and asks him to confirm the dead man's identity. Bobby does not answer.Ed and Bobby weigh the dead hillbilly down with stones and drop him into the river and then set out with the injured Lewis in the surviving canoe. A little later, they come upon Drew's grotesquely-contorted corpse stuck on a dead-fall in the river. After being unable to find any definite gunshot wound on the dead Drew (save for a deep gash on his forehead which may or may not be a graze from a bullet), they also weigh the body down with rocks and release it into the river. Ed points out that they don't want the authorities examining Drew's body and possibly discovering a gunshot wound. Ed gives a short eulogy and sinks Drew into the river to ensure that he will never be found. With Lewis injured and Drew dead, Ed becomes the leader, trying to ensure their story is consistent, knowing the authorities will investigate.After canoeing through more rapids, Ed, Bobby, and Lewis finally reach their destination, the town of Aintry, which will soon be submerged by the river and is currently being evacuated. They call the police and take the injured Lewis to the local hospital while Sheriff Bullard (played by the author James Dickie in a cameo appearance) arrives to investigate the incident. One of the deputies, Arthur Queen, has a missing brother-in-law (ostensibly one of the hillbillies Lewis and Ed killed) and is highly suspicious of the ""city boys"" version of events. Ed and Bobby visit Lewis' hospital room to make sure Lewis' version of events is consistent with theirs. While they are uncertain whether the apparently unconscious Lewis understands them, as the doctors enter, Lewis appears to awaken, gives Ed and Bobby a knowing wink, and says he remembers nothing. Ed and Bobby then spend the night at a local boarding house and have an uneventful dinner with the local tenants who tell them that they are leaving town soon because of the dam-lake project.Another day or two later, Ed and Bobby pack up their vehicles outside the boarding house and they prepare to pick Lewis up from the hospital and drive home. Just then, Sheriff Bullard suddenly appears and asks Ed why there were four life jackets found in the canoe when only he, Lewis, and Bobby came out of the river. Stammering, Bobby suggests there may have been an extra one. But Ed intervenes and says 'no', that Drew was not wearing his life jacket when he fell into the river and he does not know why. The sheriff also tells them that his men found the remains of one of the canoes above the last set of rapids where the guys claim that Drew drowned, plus no trace of Drew's body has been found along the river. Ed continues to feign ignorance, claiming not to know anything as well as claiming not to have seen anyone else in the area.While the Sheriff remains suspicious, but having no evidence as to what did happen he simply tells Ed: ""Don't ever do nothing' like this again. Don't ever come back up here. I don't ever wanna see you or your friends again! I'd kinda like to see this town die peaceful,"" to which Ed readily agrees and drives away with Bobby.The men vow to keep their story a secret for the rest of their lives. In the final scene, Ed awakes screaming from a nightmare in which a dead man's hand rises from the lake."
tt0068505,"['Horror', 'contentRating', 'Approved']","NOTE: Sequel to ""Scars of Dracula"" (1970).Hyde Park, London, 1872: A coach is seen on a road in the woods of Hyde Park. It is the 'final' confrontation of Professor Lawrence Van Helsing [Peter Cushing] and his arch enemy, the demon vampire Dracula [Christopher Lee], struggling on top while the frightened horses pull the driverless vehicle at high speed. The band around a leather strap securing the horses gives out, causing them to separate from the vehicle, and as Dracula hurls Van Helsing from the coach it crashes into a tree. A stranger (Christopher Neame) on horseback some distance away is catching up to the coach. An injured Van Helsing struggles to his feet. Dracula has been impaled on the exposed spoke of a wheel, but when their eyes meet he still lunges forward to continue the fight. Van Helsing pins Dracula to the ground until the makeshift stake destroys him and he turns to dust. Having completed his task, Van Helsing dies as the stranger arrives, approaches the pile of dust and gathers some in a vial, placing Draculas ring on his own finger. At the funeral for Van Helsing in the graveyard of St. Bartolph's Church, he digs a hole near the gravesite into which he pours some of the dust and uses the wheel spoke to seal it in.The time shifts to early on a Friday night in September 1972, a century later. Teenagers have crashed a party. Jessica Van Helsing (Stephanie Beacham) dances with her boyfriend Bob Tarrant (Philip Miller), while their friends Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame), Laura Bellows (Caroline Munro), Joe Mitchum (William Ellis), Greg Puller (Michael Kitchen), Anna Bryant (Janet Key) and Gaynor Keating (Marsha Hunt) also enjoy the music of the band (Stoneground) they came to hear. Another teen is painting a group scene on a mirror, and two others make out beneath the buffet table as the homeowners, Charles (Michael Daly)--who is the honoree--and their staid guests look on. Charles tells his mother (Lally Bowers) that he invited only the band to his party and does not know anybody else there. Joe is mildly rude to her, she urges Charles to take action, and he calls the police. The group make bets as to how long it will take the police to arrive, planning to be gone one minute before then. Johnnythe descendent of the stranger from the pastguesses eight minutes because of heavy traffic, but Joe is sure they will arrive in four minutes. The sirens come at four and a half minutes, and the teens file out. Johnny picks up a prized figurine and teases the mother by passing it hand to hand before breaking it and making his exit. The teens under the table are the only ones discovered by the cops.The group gathers at the Cavern coffee bar, where Johnny suggests they try a black mass. He has the perfect location, as St. Bartolph's Church nearby is condemned, and that evening is an insignificant date on the satanic calendar. Jessica is leery, but the others encourage her to join them. At his apartment later, Johnny looks at his inherited ring and vial with the remaining vampire dust inside. Bob uses a carwash before he drives Jessica home, assuring her that they will probably wind up partying instead of trying to raise up Beelzebub. He asks if her grandfather, as an authority on demonology, could help, but she says he is an anthropologist and dismisses the notion. He kisses her and says he will pick her up for the midnight gathering. She enters the house and finds the housekeeper Mrs. Donnelly (Constance Luttrell) is away. She goes to the home library, pulls a book about black masses and sits to read it until her grandfather Lorrimer Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) appears. He asks why she is casually reading a serious scientific work. She dismisses the concept of black magic. He asks if she wants to go out to dinner with him, but she wants to go with her group instead, and she candidly assures him before she leaves that she is only indulging in being with people her own age and has dabbled in beer, but is not into drugs or sex. Putting the book away, Lorrimer looks at an image of Dracula displayed on the wall.Late that evening, Bob pulls up at the fenced-in church and finds a loosened plank for them to enter the churchyard. He comes upon the grave of Lawrence Van Helsing. He thinks somebody has played a prank, but Jessica says it is indeed the grave of her great grandfather. Its inscription ""Requiescat in Pace Ultima"" (rest in final peace) puzzles her. She also sees that the date is exactly one hundred years to the day after his death. Joe then jumps from behind a headstone in a mask and scares Jessica. Bob is furious, but Jessica assures him she is not deterred. They enter the church to find the group decked out in shrouds Johnny has provided, and Jessica and Bob join them. Joe activates a reel tape recorder which plays a soundtrack of eerie noises and drums, while they all sit at the edges of a satanic circle on the floor and sway to the music (and to any drugs they have taken) as the aura around them takes hold. Johnny encourages them from the altar, reciting summonses to satanic entities as the tape plays out of its reel but the noises continue. Johnny mentions Dracula, and the ground around the spoke in the graveyard moves. He then calls Jessica to help him perform a baptism of blood ceremony, but she refuses. Laura excitedly volunteers. Johnny carries her to the altar and sets a chalice on her chest, pours the remaining ashes from the vial into it and slices his wrist, adding his own blood to reconstitute it. The concoction liquefies, swells and overflows the chalice. Laura screams and jumps off the altar covered in blood, but then finds she is unable to move from the circle. The others flee. Jessica wants to help Laura, but Bob pulls her to the car and they leave. Johnny proceeds to the graveyard and withdraws the spoke, a heavy mist pours out and swirls into a pillar to reshape into the revived Dracula. Johnny says he summoned Dracula, who replies it was his will as he raises his hand to show his reclaimed ring. He enters the church and bites Laura, draining her blood and claiming her as his first victim.As Bob drops Jessica at home, he rejects what they saw, saying they will all surely meet at the Cavern as usual. The group, minus Laura and Johnny, convene at the coffee bar, saying that the event could not have been real. Johnny arrives with the clothes they left behind and tells them he took Laura to the train to see her parents in Ramsgate. Gaynor says they live in Watford, but Johnny insists he is right. He uses a fake blood capsule in a water carafe to show that the ceremony was, in his words, hokum, and says Laura was in on the stunt. When the others leave, he offers Jessica a ticket to a must-see concert, but she refuses and goes away with Bob, so he invites Gaynor instead and takes her back to his place.Several young boys are playing with a ball and kick it by accident into the churchyard. They find the loose plank, enter to find the ball and come upon the mutilated body of Laura in a pile of debris. The police surgeon (Artro Morris), the detective sergeant (David Andrews) and Inspector Murray (Michael Coles) of Scotland Yard confer at the crime scene. The surgeon notes that the body was drained of blood. Jessica tells Bob she is sure Johnny is lying about where Laura went, but Bob urges her to forget it. Murray and the sergeant have identified Laura from arrest record fingerprints, and discuss the dark implications of the case. As they check her file, they see Jessica among the list of her friends. They remember that her grandfather worked with them on a blackmail case with elements of witchcraft, and decide to enlist his help again while trying to find out how Jessica might be involved. They visit Van Helsing at home and discuss vampires, the occult and supernatural phenomena when they bring up the fact that Jessica is slightly linked to the case. Outside Bob is dropping Jessica off and they see the police vehicle. Jessica tries to slip past, but Lorrimer calls her into the study to talk to the police. Though she tries to be flippant and evasive, once she learns that Laura is dead, she breaks down and admits that she and her group were at the church, details what happened, and says that the group is with Joe Mitchum. Murray tells Lorrimer she is involved but he is not sure she is implicated. Outside, he tells the sergeant to accompany him to visit Joe, where there will likely be drugs and, therefore, an opportunity to detain and talk to the others in the group. After they leave, Lorrimer finds Jessica with the phone to warn Joe about the pending police visit, and he dissuades her. He learns that Johnny Alucard, whose name was not on the police list, mysteriously insinuated himself into her group and took leadership.At his apartment, Johnny offers Gaynor a smoke and puts on a record; later they kiss and she soon falls into a stupor. He helps her into his car and drives back to the church to bring her to Dracula. In his study. Lorrimer writes the name Alucard on a piece of paper, reveals it is Dracula backwards, and concludes Johnny is a disciple. The count drains Gaynor of her blood, but he wants Johnny to bring him Jessica. Asleep in bed, Jessica tosses and frets as she has a nightmare in which she seems to witness what happens to Gaynor, and she awakens screaming. Lorrimer helps her settle back to sleep, assuring her the nightmare is over, but she replies that she doubts it. Johnny demands to be granted immortality, and Dracula reminds him that he was chosen to help destroy the Van Helsing family through Jessica. Johnny says vampirism would make it easier to find her and begs to be turned, assuring the count he will get rid of Gaynor afterward. Dracula grips Johnny by the shoulder as he turns his head for the fatal bite. Lorrimer takes out a bible, a silver knife, and a cross which he places around the neck of the sleeping Jessica. Johnny dumps the body of Gaynor out of the car to fall into the river. Later he spots a woman leaving a laundromat and he smiles, revealing fangs, and exits the vehicle.In the morning, Van Helsing goes to Sunday services at a local church and fills a vessel with holy water. Later Murray informs Van Helsing that Gaynor was found dead in Hyde Park. She was not mutilated as significantly as Laura. He also says a woman named Marjorie Baines was discovered. Lorrimer guesses correctly that her body only had two neck punctures, but Murray admits he does not know what he is dealing with. Van Helsing says Dracula had been in London before and could have returned. A phone call comes, informing Murray that the detained group members were bailed out by their parents and accompanying lawyers. Lorrimer says they might be safer in jail, but then assures Murray that he sees a pattern leading back to Johnny, and he can help crack the case, so Murray says he will officially attribute the deaths to a criminally insane killer and asks what to do next. Van Helsing recommends removing the police presence from the church so Dracula can reach his resting place, and to notify him if Johnny is located. Then he mentions possibly making use of the Cavern, but Murray says the police will be shutting the coffee bar down due to suspected drug activity.Bob goes to the Cavern and finds it closed with a police guard in front, so he sneaks in the back entrance to find Johnny, who says he has been waiting for him. Lorrimer walks to St. Bartolph's, finds the loose plank, and leaves. At the house, Mrs. Donnelly finds Bob at the door. He tells Jessica that Johnny has been arrested at the Cavern and the police want her to come join the others to add her statement. She goes with him through the back entrance of the bar to find nobody there until Johnny comes out of hiding. She sees that he is a vampire, then turns to Bob to find he is undead as well. Johnny removes her cross, burning his hand, and Bob is prepared to bite her, but Johnny says the Master wants her, and Jessica faints. When Lorrimer calls in to Mrs. Donnelly, she informs him that Jessica has gone to the Cavern. In a panic, Lorrimer runs there and finds the cross on the floor. He rushes out and nearly collides with Anna in her car. She called his home, spoke to Mrs. Donnelly and wants to help, being the only one in the group alive who has visited Johnny at his apartment. Lorrimer asks her for the address.At the apartment Johnny has a coffin in his living room and is packing a bag with candles and a folding knife when Van Helsing arrives. Johnny goads him, asking if he will give the bride, Jessica, away, and they struggle as the sun begins to rise. Van Helsing wraps the cross around the bible and tosses it into the coffin. Johnny retrieves the knife and slashes Lorrimer in the arm, but a shaft of sunlight reflected in a mirror hits him and he shrinks back, so Lorrimer uses the mirror to repel Johnny. Backing upstairs into his bathroom, Johnny accidentally releases the skylight window shade, flooding the room with sunlight. He falls into the bathtub and grabs the faucet lever, turning it on, and the running water paralyses him. Lorrimer tries to get him to talk, but as Johnny succumbs he says Lorrimer will never find Jessica. Murray and the sergeant arrive. Lorrimer says Dracula has Jessica and asks for one hour at the church as the sun sets with no police, and Murray agrees. The sergeant recommends Lorrimer visit the hospital for his bleeding arm, and Murray says they will follow other leads and visit the church later.A weak and bandaged Lorrimer returns to St. Bartolph's to find Bob has been destroyed by sunlight in the churchyard. Jessica is on the altar inside the church. She is in a trance and will not awaken until Dracula summons her. Lorrimer whispers to her and returns the cross to her neck, hiding it in her bodice, promising he will not be away for long. In the churchyard he digs an immense hole and fills it with handmade upright stakes resembling crosses, covering the trap with grasses. At dusk, Dracula appears and awakens Jessica. When she sits up, the cross appears, and the count cautiously removes it, causing his hand to smolder. Before he can bite Jessica, Van Helsing appears, urging him to remember the past encounter. Recognizing his enemy, Dracula challenges Van Helsing, pursues him upstairs and corners him, but Lorrimer produces the silver knife and stabs him in the heart. The count tumbles over the ledge to the floor below and hypnotically summons Jessica to his side for help. Though Lorrimer yells to Jessica to stop, by the time he reaches the ground floor she has removed the knife and the chase resumes. Lorrimer runs outside, stumbling at the trap, and some of the covering gives way. As Dracula reaches its edge and spots the trap, Lorrimer produces the vial of holy water and, with a quick blessing, flings the water at him, which burns the vampire like acid. Dracula loses his balance, slips on the ledge and falls, landing full body onto the stakes. He lunges back at Van Helsing but is pinned prone and helpless. Lorrimer picks up the shovel and pushes down on the vampire. The stakes impale him through the back and seal his doom as Jessica screams under his fading thrall. Lorrimer watches as the body disintegrates into dust, and Jessica rushes into his arms in time to witness the phenomenon. Lorrimer puts his coat around her shoulders, she sees Bob lying dead nearby and nearly collapses, but Van Helsing assures her gently, ""Requiescat in pace ultima,"" as she sobs in his comforting arms and they turn for home.

tt0068646,"['Crime', 'Drama']","In late summer 1945, guests are gathered for the wedding reception of Don Vito Corleone's daughter Connie (Talia Shire) and Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo). Vito (Marlon Brando), the head of the Corleone Mafia family, is known to friends and associates as ""Godfather."" He and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the Corleone family lawyer, are hearing requests for favors because, according to Italian tradition, ""no Sicilian can refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day."" One of the men who asks the Don for a favor is Amerigo Bonasera, a successful mortician and acquaintance of the Don, whose daughter was brutally beaten by two young men because she refused their advances; the men received minimal punishment from the presiding judge. The Don is disappointed in Bonasera, who'd avoided most contact with the Don due to Corleone's nefarious business dealings. The Don's wife is godmother to Bonasera's shamed daughter, a relationship the Don uses to extract new loyalty from the undertaker. The Don agrees to have his men punish the young men responsible (in a non-lethal manner) in return for future service if necessary.Meanwhile, the Don's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), a decorated US Marine hero returning from World War II service, arrives at the wedding and tells his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) anecdotes about his family, informing her about his father's criminal life; he reassures her that he is different from his family and doesn't plan to join them in their criminal dealings.

Tom Hagen is not related to the family by blood but is considered one of the Don's sons because he was homeless when he befriended Sonny in the Little Italy neighborhood of Manhattan and the Don took him in and saw to Tom's upbringing and education. Now a talented attorney, Tom is being groomed for the important position of consigliere (counselor) to the Don, despite his non-Sicilian heritage.Also among the guests at the celebration is the famous singer Johnny Fontane (Al Martino), Corleone's godson, who has come from Hollywood to petition Vito's help in landing a movie role that will revitalize his flagging career. Jack Woltz (John Marley), the head of the studio, denies Fontane the part (a character much like Johnny himself), which will make him an even bigger star, but Don Corleone explains to Johnny: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" The Don also receives congratulatory salutations from Luca Brasi, a terrifying enforcer in the criminal underworld, and fills a request from the baker who made Connie's wedding cake who wishes for his nephew Enzo to become an American citizen.After the wedding, Hagen is dispatched to Los Angeles to meet with Woltz, but Woltz angrily tells him that he will never cast Fontane in the role. Woltz holds a grudge because Fontane seduced and ""ruined"" a starlet who Woltz had been grooming for stardom and with whom he had a sexual relationship. Woltz is persuaded to give Johnny the role, however, when he wakes up early the next morning and feels something wet in his bed. He pulls back the sheets and finds himself in a pool of blood; he screams in horror when he discovers the severed head of his prized $600,000 stud horse, Khartoum, in the bed with him. (A deleted scene from the film implies that Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), Vito's top ""button man"" or hitman, is responsible.)Upon Hagen's return, the family meets with Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), who is being backed by the rival Tattaglia family. He asks Don Corleone for financing as well as political and legal protection for importing and distributing heroin. Despite the huge profit to be made, Vito Corleone refuses, explaining that his political influence would be jeopardized by a move into the narcotics trade -- the judges and politicians he's allied himself with over the course of several decades would renounce their friendships with him if he were to enter the drug trade. The Don's eldest son, Sonny, who had earlier urged the family to enter the narcotics trade, breaks rank during the meeting and begins to question Sollozzo's assurances as to the Corleone Family's investment being guaranteed by the Tattaglia Family. His father, angry at Sonny's dissension in a non-family member's presence, silences Sonny with a single look and privately rebukes him later. Don Corleone then dispatches Luca Brasi to infiltrate Sollozzo's organization and report back with information. During the meeting, while Brasi is bent over to allow Bruno Tattaglia to light his cigarette, he is stabbed in the hand by Sollozzo, and is subsequently garroted by an assassin.Soon after his meeting with Sollozzo, Don Corleone is gunned down in an assassination attempt just outside his office, and it is not immediately known whether he has survived. Fredo Corleone had been assigned driving and protection duty for his father when Paulie Gatto, the Don's usual bodyguard, had called in sick. Fredo proves to be ineffectual, fumbling with his gun and unable to shoot back. When Sonny hears about the Don being shot and Paulie's absence, he orders Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) to find Paulie and bring him to the Don's house.Sollozzo abducts Tom Hagen and persuades him to offer Sonny the deal previously offered to his father. When Tom is released, Sollozzo gets word that the Don has survived the attempt on his life. He angrily tells Tom to persuade Sonny to accept his offer.Enraged, Sonny refuses to consider it and issues an ultimatum to the Tattaglias: turn over Sollozzo or face a lengthy, bloody and costly (for both sides) gang war. They refuse, and instead send Sonny ""a Sicilian message,"" in the form of two fresh fish wrapped in Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest, telling the Corleones that Luca Brasi ""sleeps with the fishes.""Clemenza later takes Paulie and one of the family's hitmen, Rocco Lampone, for a drive into Manhattan. Sonny wants to ""go to the mattresses"" -- set up beds in apartments for Corleone button men to operate out of in the event that the crime war breaks out. On their way back from Manhattan, Clemenza has Paulie stop the car in a remote area so he can urinate. Rocco shoots Paulie dead; he and Clemenza leave Paulie and the car behind.Michael, whom the other Mafia families consider a ""civilian"" and not involved in mob business, visits his father at a small private hospital. He is shocked to find that no one is guarding him -- a nurse tells him that the men were interfering with hospital policy and were told to leave by the police about 10 minutes before Mike's arrival. Realizing that his father is again being set up to be killed, he calls Sonny for help, moves his father to another room, and goes outside to watch the entrance. Michael enlists help from Enzo the baker (Gabriele Torrei), who has come to the hospital to pay his respects. Together, they bluff away Sollozzo's men as they drive by. Police cars soon appear bringing the corrupt Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), who viciously punches Michael in the cheek and breaks his jaw when Michael insinuates that Sollozzo paid McCluskey to set up his father. Just then, Hagen arrives with ""private detectives"" licensed to carry guns to protect Don Corleone, and he takes the injured Michael home. Sonny responds by having Bruno Tattaglia (Tony Giorgio), the eldest son and underboss of Don Phillip Tattaglia (Victor Rendina), killed (off-camera).Following the attempt on the Don's life at the hospital, Sollozzo requests a meeting with the Corleones, which Captain McCluskey will attend as Sollozzo's bodyguard. When Michael volunteers to kill both men during the meeting, Sonny and the other senior Family members are amused; however, Michael convinces them that he is serious and that killing Sollozzo and McCluskey is in the family's interest: ""It's not personal. It's strictly business."" Because Michael is considered a civilian, he won't be regarded as a suspicious ambassador for the Corleones. Although police officers are usually off limits for hits, Michael argues that since McCluskey is corrupt and has illegal dealings with Sollozzo, he is fair game. Michael also implies that newspaper reporters that the Corleones have on their payroll would delight in publishing stories about a corrupt police captain.Michael meets with Clemenza, one of his father's caporegimes (captains), who prepares a small pistol for him, covering the trigger and grip with tape to prevent any fingerprint evidence. He instructs Michael about the proper way to perform the assassination and tells him to leave the gun behind. He also tells Michael that the family were all very proud of Michael for becoming a war hero during his service in the Marines. Clemenza shows great confidence that Michael can perform the job and tells him it will all go smoothly. The plan is to have the Corleone's informers find out the location of the meeting and plant the revolver before Michael, Sollozzo and McCluskey arrive.Before the meeting in a small Italian restaurant, McCluskey frisks Michael for weapons and finds him clean. After a few minutes where Michael and Sollozzo converse in Italian, Michael excuses himself to go to the bathroom, where he retrieves the planted revolver. Returning to the table, he fatally shoots Sollozzo, then McCluskey. Michael is sent to hide in Sicily while the Corleone family prepares for all-out warfare with the Five Families (who are united against the Corleones) as well as a general clampdown on the mob by the police and government authorities. When the don returns home from the hospital, he is distraught to learn that it was Michael who killed Sollozzo and McCluskey.Meanwhile, Connie and Carlo's marriage is disintegrating. They argue publicly over Carlo's suspected infidelity and his possessive behavior toward Connie. By Italian tradition, nobody, not even a high-ranking Mafia don, can intervene in a married couple's personal disputes, even if they involve infidelity, money, or domestic abuse. One day, Sonny sees a bruise on Connie's face and she tells him that Carlo hit her after she asked him if he was having an affair. Sonny tracks down and severely beats Carlo in the middle of a crowded street for brutalizing the pregnant Connie, and threatens to kill Carlo if he ever abuses Connie again. An angry Carlo responds by plotting with Tattaglia and Don Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte), the Corleones' chief rivals, to have Sonny killed.Later, Carlo has one of his mistresses phone his house, knowing that Connie will answer. The woman asks Connie to tell Carlo not to meet her tonight. The very pregnant and distraught Connie throws a tantrum, throwing the plates with their dinner around the kitchen and then breaking everything in the dining; he takes advantage of the altercation to beat Connie in order to lure Sonny out in the open and away from the Corleone compound. When Connie phones the compound to tell Sonny that Carlo has beaten her again, the enraged Sonny drives off (alone and unescorted) to fulfill his threat against Carlo. On the way to Connie and Carlo's house, Sonny is ambushed at a toll booth on the Long Island Causeway and violently shot to death by several carloads of hitmen wielding Thompson sub-machine guns.Tom Hagen relays the news of Sonny's massacre to the Don, who calls in the favor from Bonasera to personally handle the embalming of Sonny's body. Rather than seek revenge for Sonny's killing, Don Corleone meets with the heads of the Five Families to negotiate a cease-fire. Not only is the conflict draining all their assets and threatening their survival, but ending it is the only way that Michael can return home safely. Reversing his previous decision, Vito agrees that the Corleone family will provide political protection for Tattaglia's traffic in heroin, as long as it is controlled and not sold to children. At the meeting, Don Corleone deduces that Don Barzini, not Tattaglia, was ultimately behind the start of the mob war and Sonny's death, despite showing early signs of senility.In Sicily, Michael patiently waits out his exile, protected by Don Tommasino (Corrado Gaipa), an old family friend. Michael aimlessly wanders the countryside, accompanied by his ever-present bodyguards, Calo (Franco Citti) and Fabrizio (Angelo Infanti). In a small village, Michael meets and falls in love with Apollonia Vitelli (Simonetta Stefanelli), the beautiful young daughter of a bar owner. They court and marry in the traditional Sicilian fashion, but soon Michael's presence becomes known to Corleone enemies. As the couple is about to be moved to a safer location, Apollonia is killed as a result of a rigged car (originally intended for Michael) exploding on ignition; Michael, who saw the car explodes, spots Fabrizio hurriedly leaving the grounds seconds before the explosion, implicating him in the assassination plot. (In a deleted scene, Fabrizio is found years later and killed.)With his safety guaranteed, Michael returns home. More than a year later, in 1950, he reunites with his former girlfriend Kay after a total of four years of separation -- three in Italy and one in America. He tells her he wants them to be married. Although Kay is hurt that he waited so long to contact her, she accepts his proposal. With Don Vito semi-retired, Sonny dead, and middle brother Fredo considered incapable of running the family business, Michael is now in charge; he promises Kay he will make the family business completely legitimate within five years.Two years later, Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio (Abe Vigoda), complain that they are being pushed around by the Barzini Family and ask permission to strike back, but Michael denies the request. He plans to move the family operations to Nevada and after that, Clemenza and Tessio may break away to form their own families in the New York area. Michael further promises Connie's husband, Carlo, that he will be his right hand man in Nevada (Carlo had grown up there), unaware of his part in Sonny's assassination. Tom Hagen has been removed as consigliere and is now merely the family's lawyer, with Vito serving as consigliere. Privately, Hagen inquires about his change in status, and also questions Michael about a new regime of ""soldiers"" secretly being built under Rocco Lampone (Tom Rosqui). Don Vito explains to Hagen that Michael is acting on his advice.Another year or so later, Michael travels to Las Vegas and meets with Moe Greene (Alex Rocco), a rich and shrewd casino boss looking to expand his business dealings. After the Don's attempted assassination, Fredo had been sent to Las Vegas to learn about the casino business from Greene. Michael arrogantly offers to buy out Greene but is rudely rebuffed. Greene believes the Corleones are weak and that he can secure a better deal from Barzini. As Moe and Michael heatedly negotiate, Fredo sides with Moe. Afterward, Michael warns Fredo to never again ""take sides with anyone against the family.""Michael returns home. In a private moment, Vito explains his expectation that the Family's enemies will attempt to murder Michael by using a trusted associate to arrange a meeting as a pretext for assassination. Vito also reveals that he had never really intended a life of crime for Michael, hoping that his youngest son would hold legitimate power as a senator or governor. Some months later, Vito collapses and dies while playing with his young grandson Anthony (Anthony Gounaris) in his tomato garden. At the burial, Tessio conveys a proposal for a meeting with Barzini, which identifies Tessio as the traitor that Vito was expecting.Kay asks Michael if he'll agree to be godfather to Connie and Carlo's newborn son. Michael agrees and seizes the opportunity to eliminate competition from the other five families while also using the baptism as an alibi. The murders occur simultaneously during the ceremony:Don Stracci (Don Costello) is gunned down along with his bodyguard in a hotel elevator by a shotgun-wielding Clemenza.Moe Greene is killed while having a massage, shot through the eye by an unidentified assassin.Don Cuneo (Rudy Bond) is trapped in a revolving door at the St. Regis Hotel and shot dead by soldier Willi Cicci (Joe Spinell).Don Tattaglia is assassinated in bed, along with a prostitute, by Rocco Lampone and an unknown associate.Don Barzini is killed on the steps of his office building along with his bodyguard and driver, shot by Al Neri (Richard Bright), disguised in his old police uniform.After the baptism, Tessio believes he and Hagen are on their way to the meeting between Michael and Barzini that he has arranged. Instead, he is surrounded by Willi Cicci and other button men as Hagen steps away. Realizing that Michael has uncovered his betrayal, Tessio tells Hagen that he always respected Michael, and that his disloyalty ""was only business."" He asks if Tom can get him off for ""old times' sake,"" but Tom says he cannot. Tessio is driven away and never seen again (it is implied that Cicci shoots and kills Tessio with his own gun after he disarms him prior to entering the car).Meanwhile, Michael confronts Carlo about Sonny's murder and forces him to admit his role in setting up the ambush, having been approached by Barzini himself. (The hitmen who killed Sonny were the core members of Barzini's personal bodyguard.) Michael assures Carlo he will not be killed, but his punishment is exclusion from all family business. He hands Carlo a plane ticket to exile in Las Vegas. However, when Carlo gets into a car headed for the airport, he is immediately garroted to death by Clemenza, on Michael's orders.Later, a hysterical Connie confronts Michael at the Corleone compound as movers carry away the furniture in preparation for the family move to Nevada. She accuses him of murdering Carlo in retribution for Carlo's brutal treatment of her and for Carlo's suspected involvement in Sonny's murder. After Connie is removed from the house, Kay questions Michael about Connie's accusation, but he refuses to answer, reminding her to never ask him about his business or what he does for a living. She insists, and Michael outright lies, reassuring his wife that he played no role in Carlo's death. Kay believes him and is relieved. The film ends with Clemenza and new caporegimes Rocco Lampone and Al Neri arriving and paying their respects to Michael. Clemenza kisses Michael's hand and greets him as ""Don Corleone."" As Kay watches, the office door is closed."
tt0068674,"['Comedy', 'Drama']","At an asylum for the criminally insane in Texas, inmate Hammersmith (Richard Burton) resides in a locked cell, studiously avoided by the staff, who fear his oddly powerful allure. When dimwitted Billy Breedlove (Beau Bridges) is hired as an orderly, however, he is seduced by Hammersmith's promise of wealth and strength and agrees to release and accompany him.One night, Billy visits the local diner and is instantly smitten with waitress Jimmie Jean Jackson (Elizabeth Taylor). After sparring briefly with an obese customer who considers the long-haired, motorcycle-driving Billy ""trash,"" Billy flirts with Jimmie, and as soon as he mentions marriage, she pulls him into a back room where they have quick sex. Afterward, they compare their hard-luck lives and Billy declares that if she meets him the following night at the bridge, they can begin their new life on the road to riches and fame.The next day, Billy frees Hammersmith, after which head orderly Oldham (Anthony Holland), a Monopoly- and needlepoint-obsessed milquetoast, drags Billy to the asylum's head doctor, who chastises him for wreaking immeasurable damage upon the world. Billy then races to the bridge, where Hammersmith and Jimmie are waiting for him. Ignoring Jimmie's queries, Hammersmith leads them to the nearby drive-in and instructs Billy to choose a car. After indicating the obese man's vehicle, Billy pulls Jimmie to the ground to make love, and when they finish, Billy accepts the car keys from Hammersmith with no concern for the car's owner. They drive to a hotel, where Hammersmith visits the gym and steals a suit in Billy's size from a locker, killing the owner when he returns.On the road the next day, Hammersmith orders Billy to stop at a topless bar and there offers Guido Scartucci, who owns the bar along with his five silent brothers, one million dollars for the deed. As agreed, Scartucci shows up the next morning at Billy's ""office,"" a public building's bathroom, where Hammersmith murders Scartucci and steals the deed.Three weeks later, however, Hammersmith decides to move on and plots for Billy to become an executive. Back at the asylum, the doctor plans to go in search of Hammersmith, leaving Oldham in charge. Soon after, Hammersmith installs Billy as the head of a pharmaceutical company, but quickly sells the company to the Japanese. Now a millionaire in Texas, Billy lazes by his pool and disdains Jimmie, whom he considers cheap, although Hammersmith warns him that, as an up-and-coming oil tycoon, he must have a wife.One night, they throw a raucous party to celebrate a deal to buy the oil properties of Henry Joe Fitch, Jr. As Billy carouses with other women, Jimmie attracts Henry Joe's affections, and after extracting a promise from him to take her away, she takes him to her bed. There, however, Hammersmith brings Billy to eavesdrop on their plans to run away, and although Hammersmith knocks out Billy and allows the couple to spend the night together, Jimmie realizes with dread that he will soon acquire Henry's company and then kill him. As soon as the papers are signed the following morning, Henry Joe and all of his lawyers are dispatched to their deaths.Weeks later, the doctor arrives at the Texas mansion but finds it empty because Hammersmith has moved on to the realm of politics.

tt0068698,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","Al Hickey (Bill Cosby) and Frank Boggs (Robert Culp) are tired, broke, alcoholic detectives approached by a lawyer (Lou Frizzell) to find his girlfriend who has gone missing. The 'girlfriend' is actually the only living member of a bank holdup crew that stole $400,000 thousand dollars from a Detroit Bank. When Hickey starts to investigate he finds a murdered lead and Boggs discovers evidence that leads to the fact that the bank robbery from years before has a woman sending thousand-dollar bills to fences as an invitation to buy back the $400,000 in stolen money. The woman, Mary Jane, it seems is married to a leader of a Black Panther-like radical group, and is covering up trails to her by killing off loose ends and also trying to find a buyer for the stolen dough. When the lawyer fires Hickey and Boggs, and the Chief of Detectives Papadakis (Vincent Gardenia) starts to pressure the detectives after dead bodies begin showing up, Hickey and Boggs decide to track down the stolen money for the $25,000 thousand dollar reward. Attempts at tracking down the money and the girl goes wrong time after time and Hickey and Boggs get information from a direct contact in the leftist radical group run by Mr. Leroy (Sil Words) on the possible location for the woman. An established corporation of business-like gangsters run by Mr. Brill (Robert Mandan) are on Mary Jane's trail too and are alternately killing as they discover the thread that leads them closer to the stolen bank loot, and to Hickey and Boggs and their own investigation. The gangsters execute Hickey' wife, momentarily sidelining the duo's efforts but eventually galvanizing their motivations to locate the money and the culprits who have caused so many deaths."
tt0068699,"['Drama', 'Mystery', 'Western']","A distant figure on horseback rides through shimmering, midday heat. He's nearer now, a bearded man in a dark cowboy hat and long dusty overcoat--the Stranger (Clint Eastwood).The Stranger enters the tiny western town of Lago and rides slowly down the main street. The townspeople stop and watch him pass. Freighter Jake Ross (John Quade) cracks a bullwhip to wake his team of horses. The Stranger, startled, snaps his head around at the source before riding on.The Stranger leaves his horse at the livery stable and walks to the saloon. On the front porch three armed, tough-looking men watch him enter: Bill Borders (Scott Walker), Tommy Morris (James Gosa), and Fred Short (Russ McCubbin). The Stranger exchanges looks with Borders and enters the saloon.From the end of the bar farthest from some locals, he orders a ""beer and a bottle"" from saloon keeper Lutie Naylor (Paul Brinegar). The three men who were on the porch enter and take positions around him. Borders says, ""Flea-bitten range bums don't usually stop in Lago. Life here's a little too quick for 'em. Maybe you think you're fast enough to keep up with us, huh?"" Everyone freezes, waiting for the Stranger's reaction. He suddenly reaches for the whiskey bottle, scattering the local town folk, and causing the three tough men to tense. As he leaves, he whispers, ""I'm faster than you'll ever live to be,""He walks across the street to the barber shop, whiskey bottle in hand, and pays for a shave and a hot bath. He hangs his overcoat and gun belt on a coat rack. The barber (William O'Connell) seats him, drapes him with a smock, and nervously applies shaving cream to his face. The three toughs enter and resume taunting him. The Stranger ignores them, irritating Borders, who suddenly spins the chair. The Stranger shoots Borders in the forehead with a gun hidden under the smock. He then shoots Morris and Short before they can react.He stands and removes the shaving cream with the smock. He puts on his gun belt, replacing a wooden gun stock in the holster with his smoking gun. He steps outside, where the stunned townspeople are creeping over to view the carnage. A dwarf, Mordecai (Billy Curtis), gives him a cigar and offers a light, asking, ""What did you say your name was, again?"" The Stranger replies, ""I didn't.""The Stranger walks toward the stable. Callie Travers (Mariana Hill), a young woman of unknown background, purposefully collides with him. The shoulder of her sleeve is ripped, and she berates him for it. He tells her there's no reason to make a fuss, that she could have asked if she wanted to get acquainted. She angrily insults and repeatedly provokes him. He tries to leave, but she grabs him and insults him again. He returns her insults. She tells him he has ""the manners of a goat"" and slaps the cigar from his mouth. Pushed too far, he tells her, ""You're the one that could use a lesson in manners,"" and drags her, screaming, into the stable. He throws her onto the loose hay and rapes her.The Stranger walks back past the barber shop where townsmen remove the dead bodies left by the stranger and clean up the barbers shop. They stop and watch him pass. He enters ""Belding's Hotel"" and finds the owner, Lewis Belding (Ted Hartley), at the desk. The Stranger says, ""Room."" Belding gives him a key, reminding him to sign the register. The stranger merely looks at him and goes upstairs to his room. In the room, he wedges a chair under the doorknob, takes a gulp of whiskey, and lays down to sleep.In a dream, a bloodied man (Buddy Van Horn) lays in the same position as the sleeping Stranger. The man who is wearing a badge is being whipped in the street by three men. It is dark, but the silhouettes of those watching are clearly the townspeople. The three men whipping him are not shown. The bloody man asks the townspeople for help, but receives none. As he passes out, he says, ""Damn you all to hell."" The stranger wakes from the dream.The next morning, the Stranger wakes and goes to the barber shop. He asks for his bath which the barber, instantly nervous, orders Mordecai to prepare in the back room. The trembling barber nicks the man he is shaving, Sheriff Sam Shaw (Walter Barnes), shoos him away. Sam waits until the Stranger has settled into his bath, then asks if he can sit down to talk. Trapped, the Stranger reluctantly gestures that Sam may join him. Sam says that Borders was not a loved man and there will be no charges filed.Callie Travers, who The Stranger had raped in the stable, enters the tub room with a revolver, says ""You dirty bastard!,"" and shoots at the Stranger, who slides under the water. Sam wrestles her for the gun and, as he drags her out, instructs Mordecai to tell the Stranger not to leave town until Sam talks to him. After they're gone, the Stranger comes up for air and says, ""I wonder why it took her so long to get mad."" Mordecai, who witnessed the rape, responds, ""Because maybe you didn't go back for more.""In a backroom of the mining office, the prominent men in town are meeting: Mayor Hobart (Stefan Gierasch) of the general store, Dave Drake (Mitchell Ryan) and Morgan Allen (Jack Ging) of the mining company, the undertaker (Richard Bull), the gunsmith (Reed Cruikshanks), hotelier Belding, saloonkeeper Naylor, freighter Ross, and the preacher (Robert Donner). They have learned that Stacey Bridges and his cousins, the Carlin brothers, are to be released from prison that day. These three have sworn to burn the town to the ground. The group was counting on the mining company's hired gunfighters--Borders, Morris, and Short--to defend the town, but The Stranger killed them. Now, they are considering hiring the Stranger. Belding and the preacher don't like it, but the rest are in favor.The meeting is interrupted by Sam entering with still angry Callie in tow. Sam tells them about Callie's shooting outburst. Morgan Allen, her lover, tells her to be patient. Callie says, ""Isn't forcible rape in broad daylight a misdemeanor in this town?"" Allen tells her they need to avoid hysterics. She refers to hysterics not too long ago and spits on him, loudly questioning the manhood of the townsmen.Sam finds the Stranger eating at the hotel and tries to persuade him to defend the town. He says Bridges and the Carlins were troubleshooters for the mining company who were bullying townspeople before being convicted of stealing gold from the mining office. The Stranger suggests they were railroaded, and Sam admits that's why they are mad at the town. The Stranger says Sam can handle it. Sam replies, ""I'm no law man"", adding that his predecessor, Marshal Jim Duncan, was whipped to death in the street by outsiders. More pleading, then Sam says, ""This is a God-fearing town. These are God-fearing people."" The Stranger replies, ""You like 'em. You save 'em."" Desperate, Sam says, ""Look, what if we offered you anything you want?"" The Stranger stops in his tracks, turns, and asks, ""Anything?""In Hobart's store, the mayor and Sam explain that the Stranger ""has a free hand in this town,"" that he can have anything he wants in the town, ""even if it's a squaw or a Mex to keep your bed warm at night,"" and that, as far as preparing the ambush, everyone is ready to follow his orders. The Stranger pockets a handful of cigars. He gives two Indian children each a jar of candy and gives a stack of blankets to an old Indian man Hobart has just scolded for touching the merchandise. On the way out, he encounters Sarah Belding (Verna Bloom), Lewis's wife, who served his meal earlier and caught his eye. He repeats, ""Anything I want.""The Stranger visits the boot maker (John Hillerman) and takes many items, for which Sam says there is ""no charge."" He does the same at the leather maker (Jack Kosslyn's) shop. A number of townsmen follow him, carrying his booty. He leads them to the saloon where he orders a round on the house for everyone who's following him. When Naylor complains, Sam delights in saying ""Everyone's got to put something in the kitty."" Hearing this, The Stranger removes Sam's badge and pins it on Mordecai. Mayor Hobart snickers. The Stranger removes Hobart's hat and puts it on Mordecai's head, making him both sheriff and mayor. Mordecai is thrilled.At the gunsmith shop, Mordecai selects a huge revolver since he ""can't be sheriff without a gun."" The Stranger informs the townsmen they are now part of the ""City of Lago Volunteers"", tells the gunsmith to give each man a rifle, and orders everyone to report to the street for drills.At the territorial prison, Stacey Bridges (Geoffrey Lewis), Dan Carlin (Dan Vadis), and Cole Carlin (Anthony James) are released, and their gun belts returned. The jailer claims their horses were used for food, so they face a long walk. Dan says, ""Drake and Allen don't seem to have remembered."" Stacey replies, ""One way or another, they'll remember.""In Lago, the ""volunteer"" townsmen take shooting positions on the roofs of the taller buildings, while the Stranger watches from a central walkway. Sam and Mordecai gallop through town on Ross's wagon, pulling a trailer loaded with three stuffed dummies on saw horses. The townsmen rain gunfire on the dummies, but score no hits. The Stranger mutters, ""Shit.""Ross approaches the Stranger from behind, holding a knife, and says, ""I don't remember lending my wagons to be shot up."" Without looking back, the Stranger says, ""You're gonna look pretty silly with that knife sticking up your ass."" He draws and fires four shots, beheading each dummy and knocking off Mordecai's hat. He holsters his gun and says, ""You still here?"" Ross replies, ""No, I was just going."" Sam and Mordecai are excited about the shooting display, Sam saying, ""This is going to be a picnic."" The Stranger tells them to keep the men practicing.The Stranger asks two Mexican laborers to use lumber from Belding's barn to build picnic tables. When Naylor, who overheard, questions the picnic, he's told he is furnishing the beer and whiskey. Belding arrives. The Stranger overrules his objection to his barn being torn down, and tells him to provide 35 bedsheets for the picnic. Mordecai, the Stranger's new sidekick, says they also need someone to provide a barbecued steer and 200 gallons of red paint. Finally, the Stranger orders Belding to get everyone out of his hotel. Flabbergasted, Belding asks where his live-ins are supposed to go. The Stranger replies, ""Out.""Bridges and the Carlins come across three men camping. They shoot them and steal their horses and clothes. Now, instead of walking, they are riding at full gallop.At the mining office, Allen and Belding suggest to Drake that hiring the Stranger was a mistake. They argue that convicts always threaten revenge but rarely carry through, and complain that the Stranger's crazy orders have the townspeople turning on one another. Drake wants to wait a few days to be sure. The discussion is heated, and reveals that the townspeople, in addition to Bridges and the Carlins, had a hand in Marshal Duncan's death, or as Drake puts it, ""One hang, we all hang."" Drake refuses to budge and Allen storms out.At the hotel, the evicted guests are leaving, and Belding and the preacher are outraged. The preacher complains to the Stranger but gets nowhere. Sarah reports the readiness of the Stranger's connecting rooms, ""The best in the hotel. One for entertaining and one for sleeping...if your conscience lets you sleep."" The Stranger replies, ""I sleep just fine, Ma'am. Care to see for yourself?"" Sarah leaves in a huff. The Stranger tells Belding he wants fried chicken for dinner with the best bottle of wine in town, then leaves. Mordecai giggles and, when the angry Belding swipes at him, dives under the raised walkway.Under the walkway, Mordecai has a flashback to the night of Marshal Duncan's whipping which he viewed from this same position. The whippers are Bridges and the Carlins. As in the Stranger's dream, the townspeople just watch. The exception is Sarah, who tries to stop it, but is restrained by Lewis.In Callie's bedroom, the Stranger enters while Callie is brushing her hair. She gets a gun from the dresser, but he grabs her wrist and controls it. He tells her he wants her company at dinner. She calls him an animal and says she doesn't eat with dogs. He says, ""You might if it's the dog that runs the pack."" She lets him kiss her and take the gun. She says she needs half an hour to get ready. He returns the gun and leaves.At the hotel, Sarah is serving Callie and the Stranger dinner. She asks, ""Do you have any special request for dessert?"" The Stranger looks at Callie and says, ""No, I've already taken care of that."" Callie smiles. Sarah leaves, disgusted.In the hills, Cole's horse has come up lame, and he suggests they're pushing too hard. This angers Stacey, who says maybe they should leave Cole. Dan tries to calm Stacey, saying Cole can ride double with him. Stacey says, ""When they find those bodies back there, they'll be a hunting party out for us, and I want time to take one year of my life out of Lago before we move on."" They shoot the lame horse and ride on, slower now.Allen and Ross meet Mordecai walking at night. He's been drinking. Allen knocks him cold with a left hook. They look up and watch the light go out in the Stranger's hotel room.In the church, Belding speaks to the church-goers, including Drake. He complains that good people have been thrown out of his hotel, which is now being used for ""fornication and sins of the flesh."" He and Sam argue over who should step in. It gets caustic, and the preacher says, ""Gentlemen, please! Look what's happening to us."" Belding agrees, adding ""It couldn't be worse if the devil himself had ridden right into Lago.""In his hotel room, the Stranger sleeps while Callie sneaks out of bed and gets dressed. Outside, Morgan Allen, Jake Ross, and three henchmen carefully ascend the hotel stairs, which creak anyway. Callie leaves the room and shuts the door, just as the men arrive. The men enter the room and beat the covered figure in bed with axe handles. The Stranger, on a ledge outside the window, lights a stick of dynamite and throws it onto the bed. The attackers see it and rush for the door, but only three escape before the room explodes.Outside, the Stranger shoots two attackers as they retreat down the stairs, leaving only Allen, who ducks into the hotel lobby. The Stranger follows and finds Allen holding Sarah in front of him as a shield. As Allen backs away, the Stranger shoots his exposed shoulder. Allen falls backward to the floor, pulling Sarah down with him. Bleeding badly, he releases Sarah, and scrambles out the back door toward the barn.In the barn, Allen mounts a horse and rides out. Callie pleads with him to take her with him, but he brushes her off and rides on. The Stranger has an easy shot at Callie, but lowers his gun, and she runs away into the darkness.The townspeople arrive, having heard the blast. Upset at the damage to his hotel, Belding lets it slip that he knew about the attack. The Stranger hears and is unhappy. He orders the townsmen to begin digging graves, in the dark, for the four men killed. Drake assures the Stranger he had nothing to do with the attack and offers him a bonus to stick with the agreement. The Stranger doubles it, Drake agrees, and the Stranger turns and steps away. Belding whispers to Drake, questioning the large bonus. Drake whispers back, ""Promising's one thing, paying's another. He might just catch a bullet."" The Stranger says, ""Oh, you and Lewis can grab shovels too.""The Stranger turns to Sarah, who says ""I don't know where you're going to sleep now. All the rooms are ruined, except for our room."" The Stranger looks at her and smirks. Sarah backs away, shaking her head. The Stranger takes her elbow and leads her into the hotel. She calls to Lewis for help. Lewis hears, but does not respond.In the Belding's bedroom, Sarah grabs a pair of shears and backs into a corner. The Stranger lays on the bed, and asks what she is doing. She says she's defending herself, citing Callie's rape. The Stranger plays with her, recalling Callie enjoyed it, and acting as if Sarah wants the same. He says, ""I'd like to oblige you, but a man's got to get his rest sometime."" Sarah, angry at the suggestion, attacks him. He controls her, and forces her to kiss. She stops fighting and submits.The next morning, they are relaxed with each other, Sarah in bed and the Stranger getting dressed. Sarah asks if he has heard of Jim Duncan, who lies in an unmarked grave, adding, ""They say the dead don't rest without a marker."" As he's leaving, she says, ""Be careful. You're a man who makes people afraid and that's dangerous."" He replies, ""It's what people know about themselves, inside, that make them afraid.""At the cemetery, the townsmen are finishing up the four graves. The Stranger is painting something unseen on a sign. At the Strangers behest, Mordecai orders everyone to begin painting the town red. There is grumbling and disbelief, but no dissent. Naylor says, ""I'll paint if you say we got to, but when we get done this place is gonna look like Hell."" As the tired men tote their tools back to town, the sign is revealed. ""Hell"", in red, covers ""Lago"".Lewis enters the Belding bedroom and tells Sarah there is an important meeting they should attend. She refuses, saying the neighbors make her sick. While defending the neighbors, Lewis reveals that Duncan was killed because he had discovered the mine was on government property and was determined to report it. The mine would be closed, ruining the town. He sees the murder as ""the price of progress"", but Sarah can't live with that anymore. She says, ""I'm packing to leave, Lewis. I won't be coming back.""In the hills outside town, Bridges and the Carlins see Allen, near collapse, fall from his horse. Bridges sits him up and tries to persuade him to reveal the combination to the safe in the mining office. He promises that, in return, he'll move Allen into the shade and give him water. Allen curses him. Bridges threatens with a pointed stick, but Allen remains defiant. Bridges drives the stick into his neck, and says ""Two sticks of dynamite will take care of that iron box. We don't need him.""A rifle shot ricochets near Dan's feet, and the three dive behind barely adequate cover. Unbeknownst to them, it's the Stranger, who had been tracking Allen by his blood droplets. Hidden on a ridge above, the Stranger lights a stick of dynamite, leaves it, and changes position. The dynamite explodes while Stacey is firing blindly up the hill, confusing the three, and showering them with debris. Then, from another direction, the Stranger shoots Cole's ear, and the three must hurriedly shift positions. Stacey figures it must be Drake and shouts out, seeking a parley. Getting no response, he fires more shots blindly, and there is another explosion, much closer this time. The three are shook up, filthy, and scratched from the blast. As they listen to the Stranger ride away, still unseen, Stacey screams, ""I'll kill every man in Lago.""The Stranger rides back to Lago which is now completely red. He tells Mordecai, ""The guests are on their way to the party."" Mordecai runs down the street, lined with picnic tables, telling everyone to get ready. He finds the prominent men drinking in the saloon. They are scared and all need one more drink before reluctantly moving outside. The Stranger ties up at the hotel, and on his way in, tells the livery boy to get up in the church tower and ring the bell at the first sign of dust.Bridges and the Carlins ride toward the town, down out of the hills now.The Stranger exits the hotel, having retrieved his overcoat. He walks to the saloon and gets a drink. Sam and Naylor are anxious, wanting him to get ready outside, but he tells them there's plenty of time. Mordecai asks ""What about after we do it? What do we do then?"" The Stranger says, ""Then you live with it.""They walk into the street and watch everyone take their positions. A ""Welcome Home Boys"" banner has been raised at the town's entrance. Mordecai asks, ""When are you going to give the signal?"" The Stranger replies, ""I'm not. You are."" The church bell begins ringing. The Stranger mounts his horse and rides calmly down the back road out of town. The townspeople watch in horror.Bridges and the Carlins arrive, pausing when they see the banner. They draw their guns and gallop down the main street, whooping, shooting, and roping tables. Mordecai yells, ""Fire!"", but they all freeze or panic. Sam is roped and dragged over a collapsing table. Several rooftop gunners are shot or knocked back by splintering wood. The livery boy is shot out of the tower. Stacey catches Drake sneaking out of the mining office, backs him into the lake, and shoots him dead.Later, after dark, the town is ablaze. The battered townspeople are in the saloon being roughed up by Stacey and Dan. Stacey beats Sam back onto a table, yelling, ""A party?"" Cole enters with Callie and throws her to the floor. She tries to convince Stacey she always loved him, but he's not buying it. Cole wants to know who ambushed them, and Stacey says, ""We're going to find out right now."" Then, a whip flies in over the swinging doors, wraps around Cole's neck, and drags him out, choking. The Stranger whips Cole to death in the street while Stacey, Dan, and the townspeople remain inside, stupefied by what they hear. Finally, the bloody whip is thrown into the saloon.Stacey orders everyone out into the street where they gather around Cole's body. Stacey and Dan look for the whipper but see no one. Two sticks with lit fuses fly from behind a building and land near the body. The townspeople scatter, screaming ""Dynamite!"" When the fuses burn out, Stacey examines them and sees they are just sticks of wood. Dan tells Stacey the horses are gone. Stacey and Dan move down opposite sides of the street, guns drawn, searching for the whipper. A whip from above wraps around Dan's neck, lifts him, and hangs him dead from a balcony.While Stacey is looking at Dan's body, a lantern is thrown into the street. Spooked, Stacey fires three times. While Stacey reloads, the Stranger's voice is heard whispering, ""Help me, help me."" The Stranger steps out in front of a burning building behind Stacey, who turns and sees only his silhouette. Stacey takes aim, but the Stranger draws and shoots Stacey's gun from his hand. Stacey yells, ""Who are you?"", and the Stranger shoots him dead.Belding steps out from between buildings and aims a shotgun at the Stranger's back. A shot is fired and Belding falls over dead. Mordecai is revealed, holding his huge revolver. The Stranger nods and walks away.The next morning, the Stranger rides down the smoldering street. Sarah, well dressed, is climbing aboard a buckboard. She and the Stranger exchange nods. The Stranger rides out to the cemetery where Mordecai is carving a grave marker. Mordecai says, ""I never did know your name."" The Stranger replies, ""Yes, you do. Take care."" As Mordecai watches him ride away, the marker is revealed-- ""Marshall Jim Duncan, Rest In Peace.""In the distance, the Stranger disappears into the heat shimmer."
tt0068713,"['Horror', 'SciFi']","Professor Alexander Saxton (Christopher Lee) is an anthropologist returning home to Europe via the Trans-Siberian Railway. He brings with him a large crate containing the prize from his expedition to the Himilayas: the frozen remains of a primitive humanoid creature, which Saxton is sure is the missing link in the evolutionary chain. Also on board is Dr. Wells (Peter Cushing), another Englishman and a colleague of Saxton's.Mysterious deaths occur even before the train sets out. A known thief is found dead on the platform after having looked into the crate. His corpse is discovered bleeding from the eyes, which have turned blank and white. A slightly unbalanced monk named Pujardov (a Rasputin-esque figure, played by the Argentine actor Alberto de Mendoza), claims that the crate is evil. Pujardov is the spiritual adviser for Count Maryan Petrovski (George Rigaud) and his wife, Irina (Silvia Tortosa), and he tries to demonstrate to them that the crate is an omen of evil: in a bizarre rationalization, he claims that where there is evil, there is no place for the sign of the cross, and a piece of chalk fails to make the marking of the cross on the side of the crate. Saxton dismisses it as a trick and discredits the monk.Saxton is eager to keep his find a secret from everyone, especially Dr. Wells, but Wells pays the baggage man to look into the crate when everyone is gone and tell him what's inside. Later, the man does this and is also killed by the creature, which possesses a glowing red eye. After gazing at the red eye, the man's eyes begin to bleed and turn white until he falls down dead. The ape-man quickly picks the lock of the crate just like the Chinese thief did back at the beginning of the train's voyage. The creature leaves the crate and places the baggage man's corpse inside instead; the others discover it later and Saxton is forced to come clean about his discovery. Inspector Mirov (Julio Peña) represents authority on the train, and he tries to keep the news of the death quiet among the passengers, while simultaneously searching for the creature.A beautiful woman insinuates herself into Dr. Wells' compartment; she is Natasha (Helga Liné), and she uses her feminine charm to convince Wells she is a lady in distress. In reality she is a jewel thief intent on stealing the Countess's jewels from the train's safe. She is recognized by Yevtushenko (Ángel del Pozo), a prominent engineer who knows he has seen her before. Wells dines with the both of them in the dining car, but Mirov summons him and his assistant, Miss Jones (Alice Reinheart) to perform an autopsy on the baggage man. When they remove the top of his skull, they find that his brain is strangely smooth; Wells concludes that the brain has somehow been ""drained"" of all knowledge and memory. Later, when he sees a boiled fish with a white eye, he decides that this is the reason the eyes of the victims turn white; the memories and information are absorbed through the eyes, causing this reaction.The fossil continues to haunt the train and kills two guards, eventually overcoming Natasha when she sneaks into the dark baggage compartment and attempts to steal the jewels from the safe. Wells happens upon the murder scene and the fossil tries to attack him, but it is gunned down by Inspector Mirov, who stares at the creature and then collapses into unconsciousness.In an strange experiment, Saxton and Wells discover images embedded in liquid inside the eye of the dead fossil, images that reveal a prehistoric Earth, as well as a view of the Earth from outer space. They deduce that the real threat is a formless alien creature that was simply inhabiting the body of the fossil, and that it has now transferred itself to someone else on board the train. These fears are confirmed when Miss Jones is found dead in the baggage compartment, attacked by the Inspector and drained of her brain, her eyes white and bleeding. The monk senses the evil presence inside of the Inspector and pledges allegiance to it, considering it Satan. Yevtushenko becomes a victim, too, when the creature learns that he has studied the laws of physics and theories of space travel.When news of the murders on the train is wired to Siberian authorities, the train is stopped and an intimidating cossack named Captain Kazan (Telly Savalas) boards with a small group of his men. Mirov is discovered to be the creature and is shot down, but not before the alien presence transfers itself to the monk. The passengers all retreat to the caboose, while the monk murders Kazan and his men by draining them of their brains.The creature attacks Count Petrovski, who is knowledgeable of the formula for creating steel; the creature intends to escape Earth by building a vehicle using the combined knowledge of the intelligent men it has absorbed. When it threatens the Countess, Saxton arrives and confronts it with a rifle and a powerful light, which renders its deadly red eyes temporarily ineffective. Playing for time, the creature tempts Saxton by revealing that it came to Earth millions of years ago and was accidentally left behind by its own kind; it is a formless energy that has survived over all the years by transferring itself to each form of life that has evolved over time. As such, it possesses all of the knowledge that Saxton so desperately wants. It offers to help him cure disease and end hunger, but Saxton decides that it cannot be left alive. Realizing that Saxton cannot be bargained with, it resurrects all of its victims as white-eyed zombies. The zombies chase Saxton and the Countess back to the caboose, where the others are waiting. As they desperately work to detach the caboose from the rest of the train, Russia sends a telegraph to the next station ahead that they are to send the train over a cliff. The operators follow this order, thinking that they may be at war. Just as the surviving passengers manage to separate themselves from the rest of the train, it goes crashing over the cliff into a fiery explosion below. The caboose rolls to a safe stop precariously near the edge, where the survivors watch the fire consume the train and the unnatural inhabitants within it."
tt0068718,"['Action', 'Comedy', 'Crime']","John Dortmunder (Robert Redford), an inmate, goes through the exit process at a prison, including retrieving his old clothes, verifying his identity with a finger print, and retrieving his belongings. The warden offers him his rehabilitation speech but John says hes been successfully rehabilitated by the wardens program. The warden sarcastically implies, whatever prison he will wind up working for, that he will see John again.As John walks away from the prison, a car follows him, with the driver calling his name. John runs. When the driver finally catches up to him, he identifies himself as his old pal. John punches him.They drive into the city. The driver, Andrew Kelp (George Segal), hands John a beer and it turns out Kelp is married to Johns sister. Kelp asks how his time was and John interrupts saying hes not going to work a job with him. Kelp, feigning offense, starts to tell John about a job.They are at a museum, with a crowd, studying a 10 by 5 by 5 display case holding The Sahara Stone. John doesnt think its do-able. Kelp recommends John meet The Doctor, the money man, before he makes a decision. Kelp tells John not to mention that he has been in prison so as not to undermine The Doctors confidence.They meet The Doctor (Moses Gunn) at a park. The Doctor explains that he wants the Stone so that he may return it to his native country which has been fighting with a neighboring country over the ownership of the diamond for generations. The United Nations is deciding the Stones fate, but The Doctor would be more comfortable if his nation was in possession of it should the UN make a bad decision.The Doctor says its a four-man job and is offering a payment of $25,000 per man. Kelp and John negotiate with The Doctor to cover expenses during their planning process. The Doctor refuses; John leaves. Kelp tells The Doctor that John is just out of prison and has no means of support. The Doctor gives in. John comes back and The Doctor offers him $75 a week. John leaves again. Kelp says he can convince John to do it if he is offered $150. The Doctor agrees.Kelp catches up to John and John lists the arguments against doing the job : that The Doctor is not experienced in a job; that the position of the stone within the museum (30 steps from the nearest exit); that the case is shatter- and bullet-proof, made with glass embedded with metal; and that there is no alarm system meaning the guards will be extra vigilant. However, John thinks the guards can be occupied with a well-planned diversion, and the locks seem easy to pick. He agrees to do the job.They stop by Kelps locksmith shop and then go to his apartment. Johns sister greets him warmly. John says he doesnt want to work with Kelp because if they get caught, no one will be around to look after her.A woman pulls up to a garage where her son, Stan Murch (Ron Leibman), proudly announces hes purchased a soundtrack album of the Daytona 500. He plays it for her to cheer her. They listen happily. The garage phone rings. Its Kelp.John goes to a bar and the bartender directs him to the back room. Stan is there and immediately goes into a description of the route he took to get to the bar, which explains why he got there early. Alan Greenberg (Paul Sand) arrives. Kelp arrives.Stan asks why they dont just keep collecting the $150 per week. John says there is a time limit on The Doctors patience. Greenberg wonders why they just dont keep the Stone for themselves and negotiate with the insurance company. Kelp says The Doctor knows who he and John are, and he would rather not have the wrath of an entire African nation upon them. John notes that their prep work will involve a lot of pre-surveillance at night, and the neighborhood around the museum has been hit by muggings.At night, John cases the museum. There are a handful of guards milling around. Kelp works on some locksets at home.Kelp visits The Doctor at his office and presents him with a shopping list of the teams suit sizes for uniforms. The Doctor realizes that they are making progress and proudly identifies himself as a criminal.John and Greenberg are fishing by a quiet lake when John gives him a signal and Greenberg gets up and tosses a handmade grenade into the bushes. It explodes with a fireball. Greenberg tosses another that he learned how to make while studying at the Sorbonne and John says it has to be bigger. Greenberg reaches into his sack for another that he learned how to make while studying at Berkeley and John wants it bigger still, and noisier.At night, after closing, Kelp is casing the museum when a hippie hits him with a baton. Kelp yells for help and a museum guard comes out. As the guard holds a gun on the hippie, Kelp points a gun at the guard. With the guard blindfolded, they go inside. The hippie is John in disguise.Stan, down the block in a beater, checks his watch and then drives erratically toward the museum. He flips the car right at the main entrance and stumbles out as the car explodes. The guards come running out. Stan, lying on the ground with blood all over, repeats that he lost control of the steering.Kelp and John, dressed in guards uniforms, enter the display room. Kelp lies down next to the case and takes out a pick set. John is the look-out. Kelp takes a long time using various picks and John asks how its going. Kelp almost falls apart, saying that John is only asking him because he has no confidence in Kelp. John reminds Kelp that if he is caught tonight, that he will go to prison for life; and that the reason he chose to do the job with Kelp is that Kelp has golden hands. Kelp gets back to work more confidently.It does not look good for Stan as the guards gather around. Greenberg pushes through saying he is a doctor. He enlists the guards to help him put Stan in traction because his ribs are scratching against his heart.Kelp is as surprised as John when the lock pops. He goes to work on the other lock. The guards all have their hands on Stan, holding him in position, and he cries out if they move the slightest. Greenberg runs off into the museum and changes into a guards uniform. Kelp has popped the remaining lock and the three of them try to lift the display case. They struggle but get it high enough for Kelp to sneak under and in to get the Stone. Greenberg loses his grip and they drop the case, trapping Kelp inside.The ambulance has arrived and takes Stan away. The guards head back inside. Kelp crawls out just as the guards enter. A chase ensues. Kelp and John escape. Greenberg is trapped and swallows the Stone.The next day, at Kelps apartment, Kelp runs in proudly pointing at the front page of the newspaper. Stan is there, having escaped by assaulting a doctor in the ambulance. John asks Kelp if the article mentions the status of the Stone. Kelp assumes that Greenberg dropped it somewhere in the museum. Kelp asks what he should tell The Doctor. John says he doesnt care and leaves.John is at the doctor worried about ulcers, but the doctor tells him it is gastritis. He recommends John stay away from tense or argumentative situations. He thinks John internalizes his stress.Kelp has found John, with another job in mind, this time to break Greenberg out of state prison because Greenberg has the Stone. Kelp and John go to a quiet park and meet with The Doctor and Greenbergs lawyer (Zero Mostel). The lawyer tells them Greenberg will be happy to give them the Stone if they get him out of prison. Otherwise, Greenberg will exchange the Stone for a lighter sentence. It turns out the lawyer is Greenbergs father and he is not happy the others have corrupted his son. The lawyer gives John some notes and the layout of the prison.The lawyer visits Greenberg in prison and their conversation is a thinly veiled discussion about the plans for his escape.Kelp meets with The Doctor outside the UN and asks for a huge truck. Later, at night, a big rig pulls up outside the prison and Stan lets off Kelp and John. Kelp snips at a cyclone fence with bolt cutters and they enter the grounds, avoiding the searchlights. They cut through another fence and make it to the wall where they throw up a grappling hook and climb over. John pops an antacid and Kelp asks for one, thinking its hard candy. When Kelp realizes what it is, hes disappointed that for all these years, hes envied Johns nerves of steel.Kelp picks a door lock to get them into the cell block. Greenberg gets out of bed and picks a fight with his cellmate; they fight. Kelp and John sneak through the kitchen. Stan opens the back door/ramp of the big rig. Two guards walk Greenberg into the prison hospital and Kelp and John sneak up behind them and drag off the guards. They run out of the building and back to the wall. Greenberg says he cannot climb the rope. Stan drives a convertible Mercedes out of the big rig. Greenberg struggles but makes it over. The spotlight catches John just as he is going over. The claxon sounds and the guards start shooting, but the trio makes it through both cyclone fences and into Stans car. He speeds off, erratically, and guns it full speed onto the ramp and into the back of the big rig. The door closes behind them. Greenberg urges them to drive off but Kelp says the plan is to wait until 6 AM and drive off with the other trucks, then theyll exchange the Stone in the city. Greenberg confesses that he passed the Stone while he was in detention and hid it in the police station. The Doctor wonders why Greenberg didnt just keep swallowing it.John is outside the police station, casing the building. Kelp gives The Doctor another shopping order. Later, the team goes to a riverside location and get into a helicopter. Stan assures them he knows how to fly one. He flies them to the police station and they jump out -- its the wrong building. They make it to the correct building, set up equipment to jam the radio, and cut the phone lines. They throw smoke and tear gas bombs onto the street and the policemen rush out of the building. The Stone is not where Greenberg left it.Back in the helicopter, Stan declares hes had it with the Stone. John thinks hes been personally jinxed by the Stone and swears to get it at all costs. He asks Greenberg if he told anyone about the Stone and Greenberg admits to telling his lawyer dad.John drags the lawyer through a warehouse and ride up a fright elevator to a floor where Greenberg is lying on the ground at Kelps feet beaten and bloodied. They press him and Greenberg recalls that his father told him he could sell the Stone and use the money to free Greenberg. The lawyer denies this and Kelp drags Greenberg to the elevator shaft. The lawyer glares at John, saying he doesnt have it in him, so John drags the lawyer to the shaft as well. John backs off. The lawyer gloats that he was right about John. John says that some people arent willing to do such things, but some people are, and calls over a thug wearing a stocking over his head. Chicken grabs Greenberg and holds him over his head by the shaft. The lawyer swears he does not have the Stone and asks John to stop this. Finally, John tells the thug to put Greenberg down, but the thug drops him too close to the edge and Greenberg falls into the shaft. Kelp faints. John, stunned, gets punched by the thug who then heads for the lawyer. As the thug drags the lawyer toward the shaft, the lawyer tells them the Stone is in his safe deposit box and tosses them the keys. John picks up the keys. Kelp stands up. The thug turns out to be Stan. Greenberg, unhurt and hanging from a rope, threatens to tell on the lawyer to his mother.Kelp and John go to the bank. They see another customer sign a card and then the teller comparing the signature to what they have on file. Now at The Doctors office, the lawyer giddily tells them that even if they use his key and forge his signature, they still wont get away with it because hes been tipping the bank staff very well over the years and everyone knows him by sight. The Doctor is not pleased. Kelp promises it will only take a few more days.At the back room of the bar, John presents a few plans -- none will end successfully. Stan is late; there are too many construction projects in the area for a smooth getaway. Suddenly, John says, ""Miasmo.""A woman follows a well-dressed man, a banker, into an elevator and he presses a floor for her. She points out the regular pattern of lights that the floor indicator is showing, and how relaxing it is. This puts the man in a hypnotic trance. Meanwhile, John is at the bank to sign up for a safe deposit box. The woman tells the banker that when a man goes to his bank and says, ""Afghanistan, banana stand,"" that the banker must do everything the man says. The banker, in a trance, agrees. Kelp gets a call that the banker has been successfully entranced and John says he has to go to the bank first thing in the morning before the trance wears off.John waits anxiously outside the bank, popping an antacid.Kelp, Stan and Greenberg meet The Doctor at a park bench. The Doctor tells them he has been convinced to fire them by the lawyer, who is sitting at the other end of the bench. The Doctor tells them he has already incurred a lot of expenses despite their failure and they will have to be satisfied with what hes already paid them. The Doctor and the lawyer get in their town car and head for the bank.John goes to the bank. The valet in the safe deposit vault is the hypnotized man. John checks his own box and then says, ""Afghanistan, banana stand."" John gives the man the lawyers safe deposit key, the man retrieves the box for him, and John gets the Stone. John makes it out of the bank but hears sirens -- its a fire truck. As he walks away, the town car with The Doctor and lawyer, pulls up they dont see each other. John walks a few blocks and sees the team in Kelps locksmith car. They drive away cheering."
tt0068762,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Western']","The opening scene depicts an early Rocky Mountain riverside trading post bustling with activity. Indians, trappers and traders of all stripes freely mingle. A young ex-soldier named Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford), fleeing civilization, equips himself with the needed foodstuffs, gear and pack mule required for life as a solitary mountain man.After a short time in the high mountains, Johnson finds himself critically short on both food and basic survival skills. While comically struggling to retrieve an elusive trout from a swift mountain stream, Johnson is startled to discover a bemused Indian brave silently watching him. The brave quietly rides downstream. After failing in his attempt to kindle a warming fire in the deep snow, Johnson comes upon a dead mountain man, frozen against a tree. A note attached to the dead man's coat identifies him as Hatchet Jack and explains that he was mauled and disabled by a grizzly bear. He bequeaths his prized .50-caliber rifle to whoever finds him. Johnson uses the gun to bag his first deer.Johnson awakens the next morning to find that his horse has died in the night. He continues through the deep snows on foot, leading his pack mule. He is soon surprised by a venerable old mountain man whose bear hunt he has inadvertently spoiled. The old mountain man, Bear Claw (Will Geer), patiently teaches Johnson the ways of the mountains. While hunting elk, Johnson and Bear Claw are surrounded by a Crow Indian party, but Johnson successfully barters their way out of trouble. The leader of the Crows is the same brave who observed Johnson's abortive fishing attempt earlier.After parting with Bear Claw, Johnson comes across a cabin where an Indian band has killed several white settlers. One child survives, along with his grieving, traumatized mother who has clearly gone mad. She frantically places her equally traumatized son in Johnson's charge, apparently intent on killing herself. Since the boy is unable to speak his own name, Johnson names the boy Caleb. As their journey continues, the pair comes across another mountain man, Del Gue (Stefan Gierash), buried up to his neck in burning sand by the same Blackfoot raiding party that attacked the settler cabin. Johnson rescues him and they track down the raiding party, intent on recovering Gue's horses and weapons. Against Johnson's wishes, Gue ambushes the Blackfoot party that night, and the Indians are killed with Johnson's reluctant assistance. Del Gue scalps the dead Blackfeet.This works to Johnson's advantage when they are subsequently surrounded by Flathead Indians, who are the Crows' blood enemies. Seeing the captured Blackfoot ponies and fresh scalps and believing Johnson to be a great warrior, the Flathead chief honors Johnson by giving his daughter to him as a bride. Del Gue goes his own way, and Johnson leads his newfound family deeper into the wilderness.Despite a mute ""stepson"" and a wife he cannot communicate with, Johnson finds fulfillment in his new life. They build a fine cabin alongside a mountain stream before Johnson leaves to hunt for buffalo. A few days after his return, a cavalry detail arrives at the cabin looking for a mountain guide. A small wagon party has become stranded in the high country and is in danger of starving in the freezing cold. Johnson is goaded into leading the rescue attempt.Once in the high mountains, the party encounters a sacred Crow burial ground blocking a mountain pass. Johnson explains they will have to go around, adding considerable distance to the journey. The cavalry officers are skeptical, explaining that the detour could result in many dead settlers. Against his better judgement, Johnson tells the troopers to stay quiet and follow along in single file through the burial ground. It is of no use; the Indians soon know of the desecration. After locating the wagon train, Johnson parts with the white men and traverses the burial ground again, suddenly becoming spooked. He rushes back to his cabin to find his wife and stepson dead, murdered by the Crows. Johnson is wracked with guilt and grief. After some time, he tenderly places the boy and his wife in the bed, covers them, and sets fire to the cabin.Johnson tracks down the murderous group of six or seven Crow warriors and attacks their campsite, without concern for his own life. He wipes out the entire group, becoming wounded in the process. His reprisal invites a seemingly endless series of solitary attacks upon Johnson as he travels the mountains. One by one, the Crow warriors ambush him, only to die in the process. Johnson himself is wounded many times. He becomes a living legend among the Indians and the white settlers alike. During this period, Johnson crosses paths once again with both Bear Claw and Del Gue, who are aware of his predicament. They wish him well and take their leave.After months of attacks, a weary Johnson sees one more Crow warrior approaching in the distance. He warily cocks his rifle and readies for a fight. Suddenly, the Indian raises his hand in tribute and in peace. It is over. Johnson breaks into a wide grin- it is the same Crow who watched him struggle to catch a trout long ago."
tt0068815,"['Action', 'Adventure']","Set in Japan during an unspecific year of the Edo period, Ogami Itto, disgraced former executioner, or Kogi Kaishakunin, to the shogun, wanders the countryside, pushing a baby cart with his 3-year-old son Daigoro inside. A banner hangs off his back. ""Ogami: Suiouryo technique"" (Child and expertise for rent), it says. His services are asked for in a most unexpected way, when an insane woman seizes Daigoro from the cart and proceeds to try and breastfeed the boy. Daigoro at first hesitates, but after stern look from his father, he proceeds to suckle the crazy woman's breast. The woman's mother then apologizes for her daughter's behavior and tries to give Itto money, but the stoic ronin refuses, saying his son was hungry anyway.As he walks in the rain, he remembers another rainy day several months earlier when his wife, Asami, was slain by three ninjas, ostensibly in revenge for Itto's execution of a boy daimyo in the opening scene, but it was really part of a complicated plot by the shogun's Inspector Bizen and the ""Shadow"" shogun of the Yagyu Clan to frame Itto for treason and take over the executioner's post. Itto takes on Bizen and his men killing them all.Now a wandering assassin for hire, Itto takes a job from a local chamberlain, to kill a rival and his gang of henchmen, who pose a threat to the chamberlain's lord. The chamberlain plans to test Itto, but a quick slash behind his back with his Dotanuki sword dispatches the chamberlain's two men. The targets are in a remote mountain village that is home to hot-spring spa pools.As Itto pushes the baby cart, and Daigoro observes scenes of nature, such as a mother dog suckling one puppy, and two children singing a song and bouncing a ball, Itto thinks back again to the time just after his wife was killed. He gave Daigoro a choice between a toy ball or the sword. If the child chose the ball, Itto would put him to death send him to be with his mother (a better place in his opinion). But the curious child reaches for the sword; he has chosen to take the path of the ronin with his father, to live like demons at the crossroads to hell.Flashing forward to the present, Itto reaches the hot-spring village. He finds that the rival chamberlain and his men have hired a band of ronins who have taken over the town and are raping, looting and pillaging. Itto is forced to give up his sword and take his place as a hostage in the village.The ronins discuss killing Itto, but then decide to let him live if he will have sex with the town's remaining prostitute while they watch. The prostitute refuses to have any part in it, but then she's threatened by one of the men, a knife-throwing expert, and in order to save the woman, Itto steps forward and disrobes, saying he will do the men's bidding with the woman.In yet another flashback it shows the dramatic beheading and blood-spurting scene in which Itto defeats one of Yagyu Retsudo's best swordsman, with the aid of a mirror on Daigoro's forehead to reflect the sun into the swordsman's eyes.And then there is the big showdown in the village, where it is revealed that the baby cart harbors some secrets various edged weapons, including a spear-like naginata, which Itto uses to take out the evil chamberlain's men, chopping one off at his ankles, leaving the bloody stumps of his feet still standing on the ground.One of the men has matchlock pistols, but Itto quickly upturns the baby cart, which is revealed to be armored underneath, and when the gunman's pistols are empty, Itto quickly leaps over the baby cart and brings his blade down on the man's forehead, splitting it two.After all the enemy ronin are dead, Itto leaves the village, and the prostitute hopes to follow, but Itto makes a motion to cut the ropes on the bridge leading to town, to stop her from following, for the journey he is on is one that is for only him and Daigoro to make."
tt0068816,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama']","In this second Lone Wolf and Cub movie, the disgraced former executioner, or Kogi Kaishakunin to the shogun, Ogami Itto is now living rough on the land with his three-year-old son Daigoro, travelling the countryside as a hired killer. Pushing his son in a baby cart, he stops at a bathhouse looking for a room and a bath, and is eagerly welcomed in by a young woman. However, the manager of the house sees Itto as a dirty vagabond and scolds the young woman for letting him in the house. Overhearing this, Itto goes to the baby cart and retrieves a bundle and hands it to the manager for safe keeping it is 500 gold pieces, earned from a recent job. The manager's tone quickly changes, but when he tries to wash Daigoro's feet, the boy kicks water at the old man and tromps across the floor, leaving wet footprints.Itto's activities are being watched by the Kurokawa spy clan of Shinobi-class ninja, which have fallen in with Itto's nemesis, the Shadow Yagyu. They report on his activities to Sayaka, head of Akari Yagyu clan of female assassins. But the Kurokawa are unsure that the women are up to the task of killing Itto. Sayaka laughs confidently and tells the Kurokawas' leader to send their best man into the room. She then orders the man to try and exit the room. He tries to do so by grappling onto the ceiling, but the female assassins set upon him and make short work of him, hacking off his ears, fingers, arms and legs, leaving the man a writhing heap of just a torso and head before he is finally finished off.Itto, meanwhile, is hired by a clan that specializes in making indigo dye and has a secret process. One of the clan plans to sell out the secret to the shogun. Itto must kill him. The turncoat will be escorted by the three Hidari brothers, each a master of a deadly weapon; the iron claw, the flying mace, and a pair of armored gloves.As he travels to his job, Itto encounters three groups of female assassins of the Akari clan. The first group is disguised as an acrobat troupe that turns deadly as their gymnastic moves are combined with blades and turned against Itto. He then encounters a pair of women who with blades on their straw hats that they throw at Itto as if they are Frisbees. Finally, some women washing vegetables by the river turn out to be assassins and the daikons they are washing are wielded as weapons. Itto kills them all.Then he meets Sayaka, who catches him, his son and the baby cart in a steel net. Itto cuts his way out of the net and engages in a sword duel with her. He delivers what should be a disabling blow to her ankles, but the woman fighter jumps straight up out of her kimono to reveal a fishnet body suit and then runs away, bizarrely jogging backwards.Next, the Kurokawa clan are waiting for Itto, who puts together his naginata (disguised as railing on the baby cart) and gives the baby cart a shove toward the waiting enemies. Daigoro, still in the baby cart then activates blades in the axles of the cart, which cut off the feet of several men. The battle that ensues between Itto and the Kurokawas is fierce and Itto is injured before he kills them all.Weary from the endless fighting, Itto struggles along the road and eventually finds shelter in a shack. Daigoro, seeing that his father needs his help, must do what he can. Unable to carry water in his tiny hands, Daigoro carries water from the river in the only vessel available his mouth. He spits the few drops he could carry between his father's parched lips. For food, Daigoro finds some rice cakes given as an offering to a Buddha statue and takes them for his father, leaving his vest in exchange. Itto recovers and finds that his son is missing. Daigoro has been taken by the Kurokawa and Sayaka, tied up and suspended over a water well. If Itto attacks, they will let go of the rope and Daigoro will plunge to his death. Daigoro lets his sandal drop into the well, giving Itto a gauge of how deep it is. He then makes his move as the rope unspools, stopping it just in time.Sayaka watches silently and makes no move to engage the swordsman, realizing his technique far outstrips her own and perhaps also out of a sense of honor for the devotion of the father to his child.Itto then finds himself aboard a ship, carrying the three Hidari brothers. Itto is met by several other members of the indigo-dye clan, who try to kill the Hidaris but are bloodily rebuffed. The clan then sets the ship on fire in an attempt to kill the Hidaris, but the three killers escape. Itto tosses Daigoro and the baby cart into the water, the cart proves itself by floating.Sayaka has followed Itto onto the ship and in the water, she tries to kill him, but is disarmed. Itto, with Daigoro and Sayaka, find shelter, but they are cold. Itto disrobes himself and Daigoro, then turns on Sayaka, tearing off her clothes. But he does not mean to rape her. Instead, he is seeking to get her out of her cold, wet clothes and cling to her while nude. ""Three people are warmer than two,"" he explains. She thinks about taking his sword and killing him, but the cozy scene, with Daigoro sitting between them, playfully fondling her breast, makes her abandon the plan.The final showdown takes place on a vast area of sand dunes. The three Hidari brothers are at the head of a caravan of men carrying a palanquin with the indigo expert inside. The brother with the iron claw runs forward and thrusts his claw into the sand, which boils up with blood. There are men hiding in the sand. He digs his claw into the sand several times, each time creating a pool of blood and pulling up a hiding warrior by his head. The rest of the hidden men in the sand emerge and fight, but the Hidari brothers dispatch them all.Itto awaits, alone, at the top of a large dune. Each brother is dispatched in a high-pressure spray of blood, with the last brother dispatched in a lethal stroke along the throat, a cut that sprays blood in a fine mist, while making a sound like the ""howling of the wind"". The final slain Hidari brother comments such a fabled finishing stroke is referred to as ""Mogaribue"", and wishes he had heard the sound just once from the many people he has killed, but is instead hearing it from his own neck as his life slowly drains away.Itto approaches the palanquin with the traitorous indigo expert inside, finishing him off before gathering Daigoro and again setting off. The final scene shows them walking out of the desert and on a coastal trail, followed by Sayaka. Aware of her presence Itto stops the cart, looking straight ahead whilst holding out his dotanuki blade, as Sayaka wielding a katana is revealed behind him. Itto stands ominously still until he hears the sound of Sayaka dropping her sword; knowing that she can never defeat the master swordsman."
tt0068817,"['Action', 'Drama']","In this third 'Lone Wolf and Cub' movie, Ogami Itto, the disgraced former shogun's executioner, or Kogi Kaishakunin, is travelling by river on a boat with his young son Daigoro floating behind in the baby cart. A young woman at the front of the boat, clearly distraught for some reason, accidentally drops a bundle into the water, which Daigoro retrieves.Itto, meanwhile, draws his sword part way and notices in the reflection on the blade that some bamboo reeds are also trailing the boat. Itto is being followed by operatives of his mortal enemy, the Yagyu Clan; a constant threat that he can never ignore. Later, as Daigoro is relieving himself in a bamboo glade, Itto slices some bamboo stalks, causing some ninja assasins to fall from their perch.According to the voice-over narrator, this is a time in the Edo period in Japan when there are ronin, or at the very least a low-class of samurai termed ""watari-kashi""; small bands of fighters who move from job to job, working from one ""daimyo"" (feud lord) to the next, depending on who's hiring.A group of four watari-kashi are idling along the road. Hot and bored, they spy an attractive young woman and her mother being escorted by a servant. Three of them run off to take advantage, but one of the band Kanbei, the more honorable of the four remains uninterested. The three knock the escort unconscious and proceed to rape the two women. The servant regains consciousness and is furious when he sees the triad violating his mistresses. He attempts to beat them with his bamboo pole, but is slain by Kanbei, who then also slays the two women to silence them. Kanbei then makes his three companions draw straws, saying the one unfortunate enough to draw the short straw will be killed to take the blame for the rapes and murders.Itto happens along this grim scene just as Kanbei is slaying the watari-kashi who drew the short straw. Itto kills the other two rapists when they attempt to attack him. Kanbei recognizes Itto and requests a duel. Itto accepts and they prepare, but at the last second Itto re-sheathes his sword and calls it a draw, leaving Kanbei to ponder his fate alone. ""You are a true warrior,"" Itto says, ""One I hope lives on.""At an inn, it turns out that the young woman from the boat is to be sold into prostitution. Her pimp tries to have his way with her, but she bites off his tongue, spitting the bloody appendage onto the floor. The pimp dies from the injury.The girl seeks refuge in Itto's room, who steps in to protect her from the local police. But then the town's real authorities show up which are the local Yakuza, led by a young woman named Torizo. Some verbal sparring begins as Itto defends the girl against Torizo's threats. After Torizo pulls out a pistol and fires at shot at Itto's feet to indimidate him into surrendering the girl, Itto agrees to act as a substitute for the young woman and undergo ""buri-buri"", a form of torture that involves the subject being hogtied and hung in the air and repeatedly dunked headfirst into a tub of water. The subject is then beaten to unconsciousness by men wielding thick rattan canes and shouting ""buri-buri"". Itto endures the torture with his typical stoicism. This frees the young woman from having to work as a prostitute.Itto, still with a debt to pay for the death of the pimp, agrees to take on an assassination for Torizo and her father, a one-armed man that Itto is acquainted with from his past life as the shogun's executioner - acting as second during the execution of a daimyo who, fear-stricken, struggled dishonourably; Torizo's father had restrained the daimyo, sacrificing his arm to Itto's killing stroke.The target is a corrupt district deputy. Initially Itto is to face the deputy's personal bodyguards, one of whom is a sharpshooter and quick-draw artist who wields a pair of revolvers. Through cunning and guile (and the help of his young son Daigoro, who acts as a decoy), Itto defeats the armed man and takes his guns. The other is defeated by Itto in a sword duel.Itto's battle culminates in his facing the deputy's army perhaps 200 men singlehandedly. For the first time, the true power of the baby cart is revealed as it proves to harbor an entire arsenal of weapons, including spears, daggers, a bullet-proof shield, and a small battery of guns, capable of taking out many enemy soldiers like a heavy machine gun. All of the deputy's men are killed as Itto first takes out half of them with the baby cart's machine gun, and then takes out the rest with his sword and other weapons from the baby cart. The deputy is the last to fall when Itto, deprived of his sword when it falls out of his hands when he falls down an embankment, takes out one of the pistols he took earlier from the deputy bodyguard and uses it to shoot and kill the deputy. Itto then discards the gun and reclaims his sword, mumbling to himself that firearms are so uncivilized.Word of the fight has been passed to neighboring districts, and the ronin Kanbei shows up just after Itto has slain the deputy, and makes his demand again for a duel. Though battle-weary, Itto accepts the challenge. The fight is over in an instant. Itto is sliced across his back, but Kanbei is mortally wounded, impaled on Itto's Dotanuki battle sword.As Kanbei kneels to the ground, dying, he tells Itto his story and why he became a ronin a tale involving an ambush on his master's convoy. Seeing his side outnumbered, Kanbei seized an opportunity and ran ahead to attack the enemy head on. He surprised the enemy and prevailed in deflecting the hostiles, and saved the lord's life as a result, but since he left his lord's side, he was dishonored and expelled from the clan. He questions Itto whether he had done the wrong thing, and whether being a samurai means to fight and live, or to simply never leave the master's side and die. Itto replied that he would have done the same. ""I am glad to hear that,"" Kanbei says, who then asks the former shogun's executioner to act as his ""second"" in the act of seppuku. This Itto does with honor.When asked by Kanbei what is the true ""Way of the Warrior"", Itto replies that it is neither to simply live nor die, but to live through death.As Itto walks away, pushing Daigoro and the baby cart, Torizo begins to runs after him, but is stopped by her men. They implore her not to go to him, saying he is not human, but a monster."

tt0068863,"['Horror', 'Mystery']","[note: this synopsis is only for Mario Bava's true and original Lisa and the Devil (1973), not the re-shot, re-edited version 'The House of Exorcism' (1975)]Lisa Reiner (Elke Sommer) is a young American woman vacationing in Spain with some friends of hers. During a stop in a small town square with her tour group, Lisa grows to admire a fresco of the devil carrying a dead man's body which her tour guide describes as the devil carrying away lost souls back to Hell. As her group disperses, Lisa hears a beautiful piece of music. She leaves her companions and traces its source to an elaborate music box in a little antique shop just outside the main square. While inside the shop, she encounters a strange man (Telly Savalas) purchasing parts of a life-size mannequin. After making eye contact, Lisa is startled when the man bears an uncanny resemblance to the devil depicted in the painting. The man's peculiar behaviour distresses Lisa, so she flees from the shop to rejoin her friends.However, she becomes hopelessly lost in the maze of backstreets of the town. Though she has only walked a short distance beforehand, the back streets and alleyways seem totally alien to her. The locals refuse to give her directions, as side streets lead to dead ends. Lisa runs into the mysterious man a second time, though this time he is carrying a full-length, life-sized mannequin eerily similar to the painting depicted in the main square, as well as carrying the music box still playing the haunting tune. Introducing himself as Leandro, he gives Lisa some vague directions back to the main square, then walks around a corner and disappears. But the direction that Leandro points to the main square leads only to more unfamiliar streets. Next, Lisa encounters a strange man who looks a lot like the mannequin that Leandro was carrying. These bizarre coincidences begin to terrify Lisa, and the stranger acts as though she is his long-lost lover. Frantic, Lisa pushes him away and the man falls down a flight of stone steps, apparently dead. Lisa runs off in a panic.Night falls on the village, and Lisa remains lost. However, her luck seems to be improving when she hitches a ride in a old vintage 1940s limousine which contains Francis Leher (Eduardo Fajardo) and his wife Sophie (Silvia Koscina) whom are driving through the village with their chauffeur George (Gabriele Tinit). But their limousine soon breaks down just outside a old villa on the town's outskirts. The four travelers push their car into the villa grounds and knock on the front door asking for assistance. The villa turns out to be occupied by an elderly blind countess (Alida Valli), and her neurotic son Maximilian (Alessio Orano). When Maximilian spots Lisa, he becomes convinced that she is the reincarnation of a woman that loved and lost. Maximilian implores his mother to allow the four stranded tourists to stay for the night while he helps the chauffeur repair the car's engine. Though the villa is well-appointed, it has a strange atmosphere. Lisa is subsequently shocked to discover that Leandro is the family butler, who also recognizes her from their brief meetings earlier, and seems a little too friendly to Lisa.As Leandro settles Lisa, Francis and Sophie, and George into their living quarters for the night, Lisa jumps with fright when she sees the same man from the village who tried to attack her, staring at her through the window. Lisa tries to get away from the house, but her departure is thwarted by Maximilian, who begs her to stay. As she feels some attraction to the young man, as well as pity for him, Lisa relents.The four travellers are settled down to dinner, while the food is served by Leandro. Lisa further notices the weird atmosphere of the place, when Maximilian continues to remind Lisa that she has a resemblance towards his lost lover, Elena. But Francis and Sophie's relationship becomes more strained as dinner progresses. Francis' cold, dispassionate nature forces Sophie to walk away from him, and she falls into the arms of George, whom they have quick passionate sex. A short while later, George is found dead, with a pair of scissors plunged into his throat. Sophie immediately assumes that her husband did it, and she flees outside into the car where she starts it up, When Francis comes out to stop her from leaving, she runs over him over and over again. But upon returning into the house, Sophie is killed by Maximilian in a hurtful, gory way. It was Maximilian who murdered the chauffeur to prevent Lisa from leaving.With the meddling strangers out of the way, Maximilian turns his attention to Lisa where it's revealed that the man who pursued Lisa in the village is actually Maximilian's stepfather Carlos (Espartaco Santoni). Like Maximilian, he had previously fallen in love with Elena, the woman displayed in a few old photographs who bears an amazing resemblance to Lisa. Carlos had abandoned the countess and ran off with Elena, who was also Maximilian's lover. Before she had a chance to join him, Maximilian had murdered Elena and stored her body in a concealed room so he could continue to have her, even in death. Apparently when Carlos returned to the village, he assumed after seeing Lisa that she was Elena. Now that Maximilian had murdered Carlos, he puts him display in an open coffin in the parlor so that nobody can take Lisa away from him.At this point, Lisa still has no idea that Maximilian is completely deranged, and on top of that, she's still being casually nice to him. When Maximilian decides to share his secret with Lisa about his lost love Elena, he takes her to the concealed room, and shows her Elena's skeletal remains, Lisa finally then backs away in horror and rejects Maximilian. But rather than kill her, he chloroforms Lisa and puts her in the bed next to Elena's remains. Maximilian strips Lisa naked and tries to have sex with the unconscious woman. But in his twisted state of mind, he feels that the skeletal remains of Elena is mocking him and he cannot perform. Apparently deciding that in order to consummate the relationship, he will have to marry her.Maximilian meets his mother in the parlor who's paying respects to her dead husband where he tells her of his intentions. The Countess, jealous of the hold Elena, in the form of Lisa, continues to hold over the men in her life, demands that Maximilian kill Lisa and dispose of her and the rest of the bodies before the police show up looking for her and the other murder victims. But Maximilian's devotion to Lisa is complete, and rather then get rid of her, he stabs his mother dead as she stands by the coffin that contains Carlos' body.All of these events are observed by Leandro, whose presence seem to haunt the villa, and who seems to be orchestrating the bizarre occurrences as some kind of sick game. Unsettled by this act of matricide, Maximilian rushes about the house looking for Leandro who, for once, is nowhere to be found. Instead, Maximilian finds the bodies of all his victims, including the skeletal Elena, seated at the dinner table looking at him. He turns around and sees his undead mother shambling towards him. In shock, Maximilian recoils backwards, only to fall out a second floor window, and onto the spikes of a gate. Emerging from behind the body of the dead Countess, Leandro remarks, ""oh, it slipped"".The next morning, Lisa wakes up, naked and in unfamiliar surroundings. Though it seems to be the exact same concealed room, it is now infested with vegetation and she is alone with no bodies anywhere. Putting her clothes back on, Lisa walks through the house and finds that its entirely deserted. In fact, it looks that nobody has lived in the house for a long time. Confused, but somewhat relieved that the entire night's experience was apparently nothing but a bad dream, Lisa leaves the house and runs into a group of schoolgirls playing ball in the street. The balls rolls in her direction and she catches it. One of the the girls points to Lisa and proclaims her a ghost because nobody has lived in the villa for a hundred years. The girls run away screaming. Lisa walks around a little and within minutes finds herself back in the town square from the beginning of the movie. She is observed by Leandro a short distance away who is being given a mannequin likeness of her.Lisa takes a taxi to the airport and enters a plane. After the plane takes off, Lisa notices the she is the only passenger. She searches section after section, only to discover the dead bodies of Maximilian, the Countess and all the others in the first class compartment. Frantically, Lisa makes her way to the cockpit where she opens the door and discovers that Leandro is the pilot, who lets out a devilish laugh. Lisa transforms into a ghastly pale mannequin and slumps to the floor."
tt0068909,"['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Musical', 'Romance']","It is the late sixteenth century. Miguel de Cervantes, an author and part-time actor, has been thrown into a dungeon with his manservant for openly lampooning the Spanish Inquisition. In the dungeon, he is subjected to a mock trial, and the other prisoners confiscate many of Cervantes's belongings, but he seeks to save a mysterious manuscript. Having a trunkful of costumes, props, and makeup at his disposal, he suggests that he be allowed to present an entertainment, with the other prisoners also playing roles. And now the story of Don Quixote begins:Alonso Quijana - not Quijano as in the novel - (Peter OToole), is a country squire somewhere in La Mancha. He is no longer young. He enjoys reading almost incessantly. He eventually goes mad from reading too many books of chivalry (which were in vogue then) and decides to become a knight-errant himself - Don Quixote de la Mancha.Don Quixote, on horseback and in armor, with Sancho Panza (James Coco) riding a donkey at his side, sets out early one morning to find adventures. They proceed along a road on the plains of La Mancha, discoursing about the rules and customs of knight errantry, until, in the distance, a windmill is seen. Don Quixote, believing it is a ferocious four-armed giant, attacks it.Don Quixote first pierces one vane with the lance, then attacks with his sword. He is scooped up by the sails of the windmill, and ""rides"" it until he loses his balance and clatters to the ground.Don Quixote explains that, at the last minute, an evil enchanter who has it in for him has changed the giant into a windmill. As Sancho tends to his bruises, Don Quixote says in all seriousness: ""A knight must not complain of his wounds, though his bowels be dropping out"".Upon higher ground in the distance, a sprawling establishment is seen, and Don Quixote decides to proceed to yonder castle. Sancho tells him it's really an inn, but no matter . . .In the courtyard of the inn, a group of mule team drivers have stopped and want food and drink. The serving wench is curvaceous Aldonza (Sophia Loren), a hard working servant with a habit of selling herself for money during the night. As she serves, she is accosted by many men, and she pushes them off. Pedro (Brian Blessed) is the leader, and feels entitled to have first dibs on Aldonza, but she rejects him.Pedro: My mules are not so stubborn. Aldonza: Fine! Make love to your mules!While this is going on, a horn blast is heard. It is Don Quixote, arriving, asking for the Lord of the Castle, puzzled that dwarfs have not been sent out to meet him, . The innkeeper (Harry Andrews) welcomes him and soon decides to humor him in his delusions. He explains that the dwarfs are busy with other duties.Don Quixote instructs the innkeeper thus: ""See that your grooms care for my fleet-footed Rocinante, a horse of courage, sobriety, and chastity, the flower and glory of horseflesh"".When the innkeeper's wife expresses concern that he might have no money, the innkeeper replies:
""When has a poor man ever found time to run mad? Of course he has money, he's a gentleman,"" and Don Quixote is shown to an upstairs room.As Don Quixote enters the busy main patio, he addresses the muleteers and others present as Lords and Ladies, causing merriment, but he takes no notice. He does notice Aldonza, and his brain is immediately in a new track, addressing her as his lady Dulcinea, and approaches her, explaining to her who she really is in a song, ""Dulcinea"".Aldonza is puzzled, busy and not in humor for such craziness, although she appreciates being treated with respect. She assumes he wants what all the others want from her. The muleteers all keep guffawing and laughing at him.In the meantime, at the home of Alonso Quijana, his niece Antonia (Julie Gregg) and his housekeeper (Rosalie Crutchley) ask advice from the parish priest (Ian Richardson) and physician Sansón Carrasco (John Castle), who is Antonia's suitor. The women voice their worries in song: I'm Only Thinking of Him, quite concerned with the embarrassment triggered by his antics.Carrasco's views dominate: ""A man who chooses to be mad can also choose to be sane."" He concocts a plot to convince Don Quixote to return home, and then they will see what to do next.Back at the inn, Sancho brings a letter from Don Quixote to Aldonza, asking for a token that he can wear in battle, something like a silk scarf. She is intrigued but scoffs, giving Sancho a dirty floor rag. Eventually, Don Quixote gets the rag, kisses it and holds it as if it were a beautiful pristine silken scarf.An itinerant barber (Gino Conforti) shows up at the gate and enters, wearing a bright brass barber's shaving basin as a hat. Don Quixote sees the bright brass and, very agitated, demands it be given to him, claiming it is the fabled Golden Helmet of Mambrino, a magical item that protects the knight who wears it. The barber recognizes the situation.As the basin is worth only half a crown, the terrified barber acquiesces at swordpoint, and all the mule drivers enjoy the joke.As soon as the barber departs, Don Quixote kneels in front of the innkeeper and asks for a boon, that he should the very next morning dub him knight, as he has agreed to fight a real knight, but has no right to do so until he is dubbed. He will stay up all night, as required by the rules, watching over his armor. He must fast, so he declines dinner.Some time after dusk, a group in black mourning costumes, bringing a bier, the principals masked, show up at the gate and ask for Don Quixote de la Mancha. After he identifies himself, a tearful lady veiled in black asks Don Quixote to grant her a boon. He agrees, of course, and she says that their relative on the bier has been turned into stone by the spell of an evil enchanter. The spell can be broken if Don Quixote will agree to meet the enchanter in battle. The enchanter will presumably wait for Don Quixote the next day, on the road, near Don Quixote's village.The stone man on the bier was a man hired to participate in a hoax, the tearful veiled lady was none other than Antonia Quijana, and the other two were Sansón Carrasco and the housekeeper. Also there was the local village priest, who reluctantly joined the group, although he sympathizes more with Quixote.After the night watch starts, Aldonza comes to talk to Don Quixote. Exasperated, she asks him why he does the things he does. He says that all that matters is that he follow the Quest, and sings the musical's signature song ""The Impossible Dream"": ""To dream, the impossible dream / To right, the unrightable wrong / To love, pure and chaste from afar / To try, when your arms are too weary / To reach the unreachable star. / This is my quest, to follow that star.../ To fight for the right / Without question or pause / To be willing to march / Into Hell for a Heavenly cause!"". etc. Aldonza is deeply moved by the song and begins to sympathize with the knight. Pedro the chief muleteer comes to Aldonza, angry that she is late for their lovemaking. He slaps her, and a brawl ensues, Don Quixote and Sancho and Aldonza on one side, Pedro and the muleteers on the other, but only Pedro fights for real, the others are in it for making fun of Don Quixote, so they clown around somewhat and at the end of it, the muleteers are all unconscious on the ground.The innkeeper thinks things are getting out of control, so he insists on knighting Don Quixote right away, and politely orders him to bed and to leave the first thing the next morning.The muleteers decide to take revenge on Aldonza, and when, by the laws of chivalry, she ""ministers to their wounds"", they savagely beat her and carry her off with them in order to rape her.Don Quixote and Sancho leave the inn, hopeful and joyful, renewing their discussions of knight errantry, and Don Quixote corrects Sancho in his speech, saying he uses way too many proverbs.They come upon the furious Aldonza on the roadside. She is bitter, and mocks Don Quixote's attempts to comfort her.Just then, a few paces away, we see a knight in full armor, flanked by a dozen squires bearing shields decorated with mirrors. They approach and surround Don Quixote, taunt him with his failures, dazzle them shining the sun into his eyes, and Don Quixote, still reeling and shocked by Aldonza's rejections, collapses.We next see Don Quixote in bed, surrounded by the Priest, Carrasco, Antonia, and the housekeeper. His experience with the Knight of the Mirrors has sent him into a coma.First Sancho, then Aldonza, come to see him, and push their way in to talk to him, although Carrasco wants to keep them out, but the Priest says there's no point. Upon hearing Sancho's voice, Don Quixote opens his eyes and starts talking very softly. He says he is no longer Don Quixote, but Alonso Quijana: ""Soft and fair, my friends; in last year's nests there are no birds this year."" He tells the priest to write down his last will. He has only a vague memory of being Don Quixote, but Aldonza, who has found she cannot live without being Dulcinea, begs him to remember. He eventually does, and rises from his bed ready to search for adventures once again. However, his strength fails him, and he dies in Sancho and Aldonza's arms. But to Aldonza, Don Quixote can never die, and when Sancho calls her by her real name, she gently asks him to call her Dulcinea.The prisoners have been deeply moved by Cervantes's ""entertainment"" and return his manuscript to him. It is the still-unfinished novel, ""Don Quixote de la Mancha"". As Cervantes and his manservant are escorted by the Inquisition to their trial, the prsoners sing a final reprise of ""The Impossible Dream""."
tt0068931,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Thriller']","""The Mechanic""is a different twist on the ""hit man's last job"" movie, presenting Charles Bronson as solitary and stoic as ever, yet forced to realize he's aging and can't do what he once did. Rather than try to retire or get out of the business, he chooses to train someone else to thin his workload. At least that's how it appears on the surface.Arthur Bishop (Charles Bronson) is the best hit man or ""mechanic"" around. We see his meticulous methods right away, opening the movie with Bishop on the job. After learning his target's daily routine and securing an apartment with a window facing his target's window. He takes pictures of the man's apartment and scrutinizes his information at home for the perfect way to kill him. He breaks into the man's apartment and prepares it for the hit by placing a malleable explosive in a book in the man's bedroom rigging the gas oven to leak and drugging his tea. From the facing apartment, he watches the target drink his tea, and get drowsy, He waits until later that night, before shooting the book in the bedroom with a sniper rifle, causing a big and fatal explosion.Bishop next meets with Harry McKenna, (Keenan Wynn) a longtime friend of his father. Harry explains the the Organization says that Harry broke ""the agreement"" and won't take his calls any longer. He would like Bishop to talk to them on his behalf. Bishop doesn't see what difference that will make, but Harry explains that the reverence they had for Bishop's father, might make them more agreeable. Over a drink, Harry reminds Bishop of a story about Harry, Bishop's father and Bishop as a boy on a fishing trip. Bishop had fallen overboard and couldn't swim, which prompted his father to say ""he'll learn"" not moving a muscle to help him. Harry recalls that he himself had to reach out and pull him back into the boat. Harry: Your old man, he laughed like hell!
Bishop: That was a long time ago.
Their visit is interrupted by Harry's son Steve (Jan-Michael Vincent) who shows up looking for money. Harry initially gives him a hard time before handing him the $1,000.00 he wants and Steve remarks, ""My father gets uptight when I ask him for money he steals from other people."" Harry apologizes for his son's manner and asks Bishop to call when he knows something. Bishop gets a delivery which is the contract on Harry. He pins up all of Harry's personal information and plans out the hit. He scouts a remote beach location and tells Harry the Organization has asked him to meet there. When they arrive, Bishop drives up to a hill overlooking Harry on the beach. He takes shots at Harry from his hidden location and then acts as if he's discovered a sniper and is attempting to help Harry get away. Harry runs to the car, exhausted and Bishop approaches him gun in hand revealing his intention. Bishop then suffocates Harry in the car.Bishop visits a girl (Jill Ireland) who role plays a rather mundane drama with him, playing his neglected girlfriend, including reading a letter she wrote, requiring him to comfort her. After they spend the night together, she announces that the letter was difficult and will cost him another hundred. He agrees, remarking that the letter was a good touch, recommending something like it for next time.Bishop runs into Steve again at Harry's funeral. Steve isn't too bothered by his father's death, describing his father to Bishop as ""Harry McKenna, fixer extraordinaire, pusher, pimp, thief, arsonist..."" Bishop asks, ""You liked him a lot?"" Bishop tells Steve that Harry had worked for his father years ago. Steve realizes that this means Bishop's father was in the Organization and he asks Bishop if he's in himself, surmising that he is although Bishop tries to change the subject, reminding him to pay attention to the funeral. When Bishop remarks on Steve being sure of himself he responds ""I live in my mind, Mr. Bishop."" Bishop: ""Sounds like something I read someplace.
Steve: And so do you.Bishop leaves the service and Steve asks him for a ride home. Bishop agrees and finds that Harry's (now Steve's) house is full of Steve's friends having a party. Wading through the crowd, Steve tells Bishop, ""My father never really liked my friends, and I'm not so sure I do either."" Steve gets a phone call from a girlfriend, Louise, threatening to kill herself. He asks Bishop if he'll come along to visit Louise. They find Louise with razor blades, preparing to slit her wrists. Steve makes a show of not caring and Louise cuts one of her wrists to prove she will, still getting no reaction from Steve or Bishop, other than Bishop telling her how long it will take her to die based on her weight. Louise insists that Steve will stop her before she dies, but Steve says ""Listen, if you don't care anything about your life, then why should I?"" Steve throws her some car keys and tells her she might live if she heads to the Sheriff's station in Malibu right away. Discussing the situation, and the idea of watching someone die, Bishop he tells Steve ""It just means you have your own rule book.""
Steve: I can dig that.
Bishop: It takes a very special kind of person to pick up the tab for that kind of living. You say you dig it, but you're talking about something you really know nothing about.
Steve: And you do?
Bishop: Do I?Bishop attends to his routines including martial arts, and knife throwing as well as talking a lot of pills. Visiting an aquarium he passes out, and wakes up in the hospital. The Doctor at the hospital recommends he see his own doctor, and says it sounds like he's experiencing ""Acute Anxiety Reaction"" adding that if it isn't that, he may want to try a psychiatrist. He wakes up the next morning to find Steve parked outside his house. Steve is impressed with his place and Bishop explains he inherited a lot. Steve tries to convince him to let him in on his ""action"" Bishop takes Steve out in a plane, letting go of the controls and forcing Steve to take over, which he quickly does. At a bar later, Bishop explains that his father was a ""Judge"" who had the final word settling Organization disputes,until someone didn't like a decision and put a contract out on him, when Bishop was sill in school. Steve shares that his father never let him in on anything, although he wanted to know the business. Bishop lets him witness a karate match which turns pretty brutal. Steve remarks ""He practically murdered that guy."" and Bishop answers ""Murder is only killing without a license and everybody kills, governments, the military, the police.""
Steve: Do you think Yamato's a killer?
Bishop: He's a killer that doesn't kill. It's funny. No, for him, the rules are important.
Steve: That's your expert opinion?
Bishop: That's my opinion.
Steve points out that Bishop is being evasive about giving real answers. Bishop reminds him that he better be sure he wants the answers he's asking for. He asks Steve what he knows about the term ""Mechanic"" and Steve tells him it can be used as synonymous with hit man. Bishop reveals that's what he is and tells Steve that sometimes he could use a back up. Steve asks, ""You do this for money?""
Bishop: Money is paid, but that's not the motive. It has to do with standing outside of it all, on your own.
He offers to teach Steve all he can, and confirming he's in, Steve says ""You've got a partner Mr. Bishop."" Bishop corrects him, ""Associate.""Steve demonstrates an aptitude for the work and they start training for real. Going through a museum Bishop tells Steve ""There are killers and there are killers, to tell you the truth they all have a different book of rules. To get away with it depends on the book of rules you have in your pocket at the time, your own country, somebody else's country, or your own personal book of rules. All this (waves at the museum figures) heroes, half of them are killers. Napoleon was one you know, Pancho Villa, Genghis Khan, and the we have our own domestic brand, like Billy the Kid, Jesse James and John Dillinger. Yeah, they're about as famous as our own honest to goodness heroes.""Bishop gets an assignment to kill three men, who are in the habit of riding around on dirtbikes, but live behind heavy security with constant guards on watch. Bishop includes Steve in the job, including the surveillance. Bishop surprises Steve by watching one of the men in a conversation via binoculars and reading their lips to discover a ""Chicken Licken"" truck set to arrive at the guarded compound for a delivery. Bishop finds vats of acid at a plating plant to dump the bodies afterwards. Steve and Bishop take the Chicken Licken truck and enter the compound. The hit is messy though and one of the men escapes forcing Bishop to chase the man on a dirtbike. Although the man ends up dead, the chase causes quite a commotion running through backyard parties and causing car accidents. Bishop is called to meet with one of the Organization heads. He takes a plane to meet a chauffeured car which brings him to the estate. The man (Frank DeKova) is paining a leopard which he has tied in the yard. The man comments that the last job was very messy and asks about Harry McKenna's son and how he's involved in things. Bishop takes exception at the thought of having to ask permission. The man reminds him that there are rules in place which ensure the Organization survives, implying that Bishop has broken a rule.
He gives Bishop a new assignment saying it has to be done fast.
Bishop: I'll handle it the way I always do.
Man: There may not be time enough for that. The word is he's getting ready to talk to some people. The problem is considerable. Bishop: I'm not some wild Cleveland shooter. I don't cowboy!
Man: If he talks, things could get complicated, sloppy. That would disturb a lot of us. It's not really open to discussion, Mr. Bishop. This business of McKenna's son has upset a few of our associates.
The man tells him that the target is in Naples, where they have him a room already. Bishop gets home and heads to Steve's place. Finding Steve is out, he looks around and finds that Steve has taken a contract to kill him. He puts the papers back and goes home. When Steve shows up at Bishop's house later, he fills him in on the Naples job, telling him they want it ""Cowboyed"" He also tells Steve that he is nevertheless going to do it the way he's always done.They head to Naples and start watching the target, discovering that the man is very unpredictable, rarely doing the same thing twice, with the exception of returning to his boat. Bishop shares a local wine with Steve, explaining that it doesn't travel well and they don't export it. He reminds Steve to savor it and the time he has. He also gives Steve advice about planning hits, telling him, ""You've got to be dead sure, or dead."" Bishop tells Steve he'll pick up some scuba gear and they'll use it to get on the boat undetected to kill the target. They succeed and Bishop plans an explosive before they leave. As they get off the boat, some Organization men show up after them in speedboats. They watch as the men get blown up with the boat. Steve asks who the men are and Bishop explains that they're Organization men, after him because he broke a rule by not asking them to start training him. More men show up soon, leading to a car chase. Bishop blows up a car chasing them and then sends an exploding car into a roadblock set for him, and pushes the last pursuing car off the mountain road with a bulldozer he finds on the side of the road.Back at their room, Steve offers Bishop a glass of the local wine he likes. Steve watches with interest as Bishop has a sip. Bishop insects the glass himself suspiciously before picking up his bag to go, only to double over in pain. Steve says ""Brucine! You'll be dead in a few minutes. Listen, you'll really appreciate this. This stuff is absolutely clear when it's in solution. I just coated the inside of the glass with it and let it dry. When the wine hit it it went right back into solution. No trace. Looks just like a heart attack."" Bishop keeps struggling on the ground in agony. Steve continues ""You said every man has his jelly spot. Yours was you just couldn't cut it alone.""
Bishop: Was it because of your father?
Steve: You killed him? I thought he just died. You see? There you are. They told you who to hit. Kept the whole idea from being what we talked about. You needed a license, their license. I'm gonna pick my own mark, hit when I want. Just like you said, standing outside. See Naples and die.""Steve heads to Bishop's place, as if making it his own. He picks up the ball Bishop would squeeze to strengthen his fingers and then gets into his car and finds a note taped to his rear view mirror. We hear Bishop reading it to him "" Steve, if you read this it means I didn't make it back. It also means you've broken a filament controlling a thirteen second delay trigger. End of game. Bang, you're dead."""
tt0069019,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","In the small Southern Italian village of Accendura, three local boys, Bruno, Michele, and Tonino are engaged in mischief and other activities. Guiseppe Barra (Vito Passeri) a local simpleton and peeping tom, who is seen spying on two rowdy swinging couples, is surprised when which the three boys appear behind him and yell out, ""Giuseppe's a big baby!"" which goads him into a state of bitter resentment.Meanwhile, in the hills surrounding the village, a reclusive Gypsy witch named La Magiara (Florinda Bolkan), is conducting sinister black magic ceremonies, first by digging up the skeletal remains of an infant, and then plunging pins through the heads of three tiny clay dolls. It makes it clear that these are the three youths taunting Giuseppe.When Michele returns home, his housekeeper mother urges him to deliver some orange juice to their employer, Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet) a young woman from Milan who is laying low in the village after a drug scandal. It becomes apparent that Patrizia offers undefined sexual favors to the local adolescents when she's shown sexually taunting Michele.When Bruno Lo Casio goes missing, a media circus begins as reporters from all over Italy converge on the town. One of them is Andrea Martelli (Tomas Milian) a sharp-witted journalist from Rome whose insights into the case are acknowledged by the regional police commissioner (Virginio Gazzolo) working with the collaboration of the village chief of police Captain Modesti (Ugo D'Alessio). Amid local hysteria, Giuseppe is soon arrested when he's found near the dead body of Bruno. But he protests his innocence for he claims to have only discovered the body of the boy and then phoned the parents in a feeble attempt to extract a pitiful ransom of six million lira. When another dead body of a young boy, that of Tonino is found, the police realize that he really is innocent.A few nights later, during a raging thunderstorm, Michele Spriano, sneaks out of his house to meet with someone he speaks to over the phone, and he too is strangled by an unseen assailant and his body is found the following morning.Martelli soon meets and befriends Patrizia whom he recognizes from newspapers where he used to work in Milan. Patrizia is considered a slut by rest of the insular villagers mainly because of her modern style of dress with halter-tops and mini-skirts. Martelli also meets with the amiable young village priest, Don Alberto Avallone (Marc Poreli) and his strangely reserved mother Aurelia (Irene Papas). Don Alberto runs a boys group at the church (which the murder victims came from) and he also encourages the boys to play soccer on the church grounds to keep them off the streets and out of trouble. Since he is the priest and connected with the powerful Catholic Church (which holds the real power in Italy), he is well known and respected by everyone in the village and surrounding area. But Aurelia is a dour mysterious woman. A villager confides in Martelli that, ""she is only tolerated because she is the priest's mother.""Elsewhere, Captain Modesti and his aide meet with Francesco (George Wilson), an eccentric old hermit living in a tumbledown stone hut in the hills overlooking the town, who practices black magic and offers charms and potions to the superstitious. He claims to the police that he has passed his knowledge of black magic to his disciple, Magiara, and also shares time with the causal thrill-seeking Patrizia. He is also rumored to have had (and then disposed of) a baby from a tryst with Magiara.Angered by Francesco's unwillingness to co-operate with the investigation, the police proceed to hunt down and arrest Magiara. Under interrogation, the fevered woman gleefully confesses to the murders. However, it transpires to Modesti and the Commissioner that she believes her voodoo dolls and incantations have merely brought about the deaths of the three interfering boys, and she profess to have no interest or awareness of the physical methods used. An alibi provided by a policeman sighting Magiara miles away from the latest murder scene clinchers her legal innocence and she is released the following day.Nonetheless, the hostile and superstitious villagers are not convinced and the so-called ""witch"" is set upon in a local graveyard by a small mob of men who savagely beat her with heavy chains and then leave her for dead. The bloodied and mortally wounded Magiara drags herself quite a distance to the nearby expressway where she futilely tries to flag down a car, and then dies on the shoulder of the road. The following day, another young boy is found murdered, drowned in a local stream, which further increases police frustration to the case. However, the unsophisticated and religious townspeople are beside themselves with silent fear... continuing to believe that ""the witch"" is responsible for the killings and she is doing so from beyond the grave with a curse over the whole town.Patrizia herself briefly becomes a suspect when Martelli finds her gold-plated cigarette lighter at the scene of the latest killing and while being interrogated by the police, she refuses to supply an alibi for those nights of each killing. But under the threat of incarnation, she's forced to admit that she traveled outside Accendura to buy marijuana for herself. With little to hold her on, the police let her go as well.Martelli and Patrizia become more determined to track down the killer on their own. During further meetings with Don Alberto, Martelli also learns that Don Alberto's mother has another young child, a six-year-old girl born mentally retarded. Martelli becomes convinced that the little girl is a witness to the killings after seeing that she compulsively pulls the heads off her dolls, as if doing an imitation to the strangulation's. One doll's head, that of Donald Duck, is found near the latest crime scene, which this leap of reason proves accurate. But Martelli and Patrizia wonder: is the killer the priest or his mother?When Aurelia disappears with her daughter, Martelli and Patrizia track her down to a remote shack on a hill overlooking the town and when they arrive, Aurelia is found barely conscious begging them to help her stop her crazy son. It is Don Alberto who is the killer. It turns out that he straggled those young boys not for their sins, but to PREVENT them from committing sin when they grow up, as well as save them from the ""horrors of sexuality"", thus (in his mind) sending them to heaven with clean souls.In an act contrary to even his sick rationale, he attempts to throw his little sister, a witness to the crimes, off a remote cliff. Martelli arrives in the nick of time, and after a long and climatic fistfight between Martelli and Don Alberto, the twisted priest looses his balance and falls of the cliff to his gruesome death."
tt0069048,"['Horror', 'contentRating', 'PG']","Peter Kleist (Antonio Cantafore) is an American college student who arrives in Vienna, Austria to take a break from his college studies and to look up his family's history. At the airport, he is greeted by his uncle, Karl Hummel (Massimo Girott), who invites him to stay at his house. Peter asks Karl about his great-grandfather, Baron Otto Von Kleist. Karl explains that the Baron's name still spreads fear among the local people for he was a notorious sadist who tortured and murdered over 100 of the villagers for the sole purpose of watching them die. Karl also tells Peter that the Baron's old castle and former residence is being remodeled into a hotel for tourists. Peter persuades his uncle to take him to the castle.After a long drive through the countryside, they arrive at the ominous castle on a hill, where they meet with Herr Dortmund (Dieter Tressler) the entrepreneur responsible for the current hotel project. Peter is particularly interested in Dortmundt's beautiful assistant Eva (Elke Sommer), a former college student of Karl's whose job is to ensure that Dortmundt does not make any lasting changes to the castle's architectures. After a brief tour of the castle, Karl invites Eva to his house for dinner.During the course of the meal at Karl's house, Peter brings up the subject of Baron Von Kleist, much to the consternation of his aunt (Valeria Sabel). Gretchen (Nicoletta Elmi), Karl's young daughter, claims to have actually seen the Baron in the woods near the castle, but nobody listens to her. Peter then produces an ancient document he claims to have found at his grandfather's house back in America. It is an incantation which, if read in the castle bell tower at midnight, will supposedly bring the Baron back to life. Karl warns him off of trying the ritual for a man's obsession with the occult could lead to danger.Despite this warning, Peter and Eva go to the castle and read the incantation inside the bell tower. Although it is midnight, the bell tolls two o'clock, the same time Baron Von Kleist was murdered by his victims. Heavy footsteps approach from the outside. A terrified Eva tries to convince Peter to recant the incantation, using the alternate spell on the same document. But before Peter can do so, the doors fling open, and the wind blows the parchment out of his hands and into a fireplace. Peter goes outside to investigate, but there is no one there. Eva knows the consequences of what they have done.Meanwhile, in the deep woods surrounding the castle, the reincarnated Baron emerges from his grave where he was buried there hundreds of years before. The Baron stumbles into the night and pays a visit to a local doctor's office for medical attention. Just as the legend as foretold, he has risen with the same bloody scars that were inflicted on him when he was killed so many years ago. The doctor (Gustavo De Nardo) dresses his strange patient's wounds and is understandably concerned by the terrible condition he is in, When the doctor insists on calling an ambulance, the Baron grabs a scalpel and stabs the doctor to death. Fleeing into the night, the Baron encounters a drunken grave digger, who is also killed.The next morning, Peter and Eva admit what they've done. Karl insists to them that they are just imaging things and tells them to forget about it. But the Baron secretly enters his castle and kills Dortmundt by hanging him from the castle ceiling. When the body is found by Fritz (Luciano Pigozzi) the caretaker of the castle, the Baron grabs him and takes him down to the dungeon where he kills Fritz by throwing him into a spike-lined coffin. When Dortmundt is found dead, the plans for restoring the castle fall through and the property goes up for auction.The next day, the castle is quickly purchased by Alfred Becker (Joseph Cotton), a wheelchair-bound millionaire. Despite the fact that nobody knows anything about him or his past, Becker seems amiable enough and offers Eva a job in assisting him to restore the castle to its original condition. She gladly accepts. Later, Eva is attacked in one of the castle corridors by the Baron, only to be saved by the intrusion of Peter. Eve quits her job and decides to make a fresh start elsewhere. That evening, Eva returns to her apartment in town, only to find the disfigured, black-cloaked Baron waiting for her. Eva escapes out a window and runs through the fog-shrouded streets of the town, playing cat-and-mouse with the pursuing Baron. Eva manages to outsmart her pursuer by seeking shelter at Karl's home.Finally convinced that the Baron is alive, Karl agrees to help Eva and Peter find a way to destroy him. The visit a local medium, named Christine (Rada Rassimov) who conjurs up a spirit from the netherworld for information about the Baron and his resurrection. Christine gives them a magic amulet which will help them, and she tells them that Peter and Eva are the only ones with the power to destroy the Baron for the ones who raised him are the ones who can destroy him. She also informs them that the Baron knows that Peter and Eva have the power to kill him, so he will do everything in his power to kill them before they can do so. After Peter, Eva, and Karl leave, Christine is attacked and killed by the Baron.Later that day, on her way home from school Gretchen is terrorized by the Baron, who chases her though the woods. But for some reason, the Baron does not kill Gretchen and lets her get away. After taking her to the castle, Gretchen meets with Becker for the first time. Afterwards, she tells her father that Becker is the same man who chased her in the woods. Karl asks how can she know and Gretchen replies that she recognized him by his eyes, which ""burn like fire.""Realizing that any man who has the ability to rise from the dead might also have the power to alter his appearance, Karl, Peter and Eva go to the castle to confront Becker, who denies knowing what they are talking about. When he shows them the castle which is now restored, complete with dummies impaled on wooden stakes, the appearance gives the trio the impression that Becker really is the Baron. As Karl, Peter and Eva secretly debate what do to, Becker, no longer pretending to be crippled, rises from his wheelchair and advances towards them. Peter tries to reason with Becker, but he only knocks him out. Karl pulls out a gun and tries shooting at Becker/the Baron, but he keeps on advancing and also knocks Karl out. Eva holds up the magic amulet to try to use against him, but Becker only flings her aside against a wall, knocking her out. The Baron/Becker then takes the three down to his torture chamber.When the blooded and battered Eva wakes up, she is tied up to a chair and is startled to see Fritz's dead body in the open spike-lined coffin beside her. Becker ties up Karl to a rack to be slowly stretched to death while he ties up Peter and begins torturing him with red-hot pokers. As Eva struggles to untie herself, she accidentally drops the amulet onto Fritz's dead body. A few drops of Eva's blood from her wounds lands on Fritz's body and the amulet itself. Suddenly, the Baron starts to suffer terrible pains as Fritz rises out of his coffin. The secret of how to destroy the Baron finally comes to light: the Barons victims all rise from their coffins, empowered by the magic amulet which is powered up with blood of the ones who raised him (either Eva or Peter). The undead victims whom include Fritz, Dortmundt, Christine, the doctor, grave digger, etc, all attack the Baron and literally rip him limb from limb. Eva manages to untie both Peter and Karl, and the wounded, blood-covered trio flee from the dungeon, and into Karl's car where they drive away from the castle, while the sounds of the Baron's dying screams echo into the night air."

tt0069089,"['Comedy', 'Crime']","The film opens on a view of a pink trailer that seems to be located in a clearing near a rural wooded area. A voiceover narrator identifying himself as Mr. J (John Waters) discusses the current status of ""notorious beauty"" Divine (Divine), who has gotten tabloid attention due to her criminal career. The tabloids have given
Divine the title of ""Filthiest Person Alive"", and the coverage has forced her to disguise herself. She has adopted the alias of Babs Johnson and retreated to this rural trailer just outside Baltimore. She lives there with her son, Crackers (Danny Mills), and a young woman named Cotton (Mary Vivian Pearce), whom Mr. J identifies as Divine's ""traveling companion"". Also living in the trailer is Edie (Edith Massey), Divine's obese, senile mother.Inside the trailer, Edie has awakened and calls out to Babs; Edie sleeps in a playpen in the living room, wearing nothing but a bra, girdle and underpants. Edie demands that Babs bring her eggs, and we come to
understand that Edie is obsessed with eggs. When Babs doesn't respond soon enough, Edie tries to get Cotton to bring her eggs. Babs appears first, wearing a garish outfit. Her hair is an unnatural bright yellow
color, with an unusually high hairline and a fall attached.Babs and Edie have a brief discussion, with Babs being very patient and accomodating of her obviously feeble-minded mother. Edie calls the trailer a ""train"", and worries about when the Egg Man (Paul Swift) is going to stop by. Babs assures her that they still have eggs that she can prepare for her.Mr. J then discusses Connie (Mink Stole) and Raymond Marble (David Lochary), whom he calls ""two jealous perverts"" who are insanely jealous of Divine's fame. Connie is a strange looking woman with hair dyed bright red. We meet her as she is conducting a strange job interview in her home. She tells a young woman named Sandy Sandstone (Nancy Crystal) that she cannot offer her employment because she does not know
enough about Divine; apparently, the Marbles intend to spy on Divine and learn details about her lifestyle. Connie is a snobbish woman who belittles Sandy and infuriates her until she storms out in a rage. The film cuts back and forth between Divine's family and the Marbles, as they progress on a collision course with one another.Divine and Crackers go into town to run errands in Divine's Coup De Ville. Along the way, they deliberately run a jogger (Steve Waters) off the road and pretend to pick up a soldier (Elia Katz) hitch-hiking home, pulling away at the last minute before he can get in the vehicle, much to the amusement of Divine.Connie then meets with a lesbian couple (one of them Pat Lefaiver) who have come to her to adopt a baby. While Connie is talking to them, she sends her servant, Channing (Channing Wilroy) into the basement. There are two young women imprisoned down there, one dead (Marina Melin) and one alive and enraged. The dead woman has just given birth and Channing takes the baby upstairs so Connie can sell it to the lesbian couple. Before he leaves, the surviving girl, Susie (Susan Walsh), verbally berates Channing and curses him for his role in her kidnapping. She, too, is pregnant, and Channing is the father. Channing impregnates the women and gets rid of the bodies when they die in childbirth.After she parks the car, Crackers goes off on his own to make a date he has with a young woman. In a small grocery store, Divine shoplifts a steak from the butcher counter by discarding the wrapping paper and concealing the meat under her dress between her legs. She strolls through downtown Baltimore and turns the heads of passersby, then walks through a suburban neighborhood and urinates on the front lawn of a large stately home.We then see Raymond Marble, whose long hair is dyed bright blue. Raymond has a fetish for indecent
exposure; he lurks outside of an office building and follows two young women as they walk to a park to eat
their lunch. Raymond sneaks up behind them while wearing a bizarre mask, then opens his long coat to
reveal his penis hanging outside his pants with a long piece of sausage attached to it. The girls run off screaming and he takes the purses they have left behind.Later, Raymond and Connie welcome Cookie (Cookie Mueller) to their home. Cookie is a young woman who tells the Marbles that she can get them information about Divine because she is Crackers's date for the afternoon. The Marbles reveal their scheme: learn about Divine's private life and find the best way to disgrace her, while simultaneously seizing her title as ""The Filthiest Person Alive"". The Marbles tell Cookie about their baby ring, and they reveal that they also own several pornography shops and front money to heroin pushers in elementary schools. They feel that this is much filthier than Divine, and are resentful of the attention she has gotten.Cookie and Crackers go back to the trailer, where Cookie has a private conversation with Edie. Edie reveals that it is Babs's birthday and a party is planned. She also tells Cookie a few things about their home life. Meanwhile, Crackers excitedly talks to Cotton about his date, and tells her he has something special planned. Cotton is a voyeur who likes to watch Crackers in sex acts with women, and insists that Crackers never touch her personally.After introducing her to Cotton, Crackers takes Cookie to the little shed behind the trailer that he uses as
a private bedroom. Inside, Crackers and Cookie are naked on the dirty cot, and Crackers shoves two live
chickens at Cookie's nude body while she screams in horror. The chickens claw large scratches on her body, and in the process become crushed and killed between the bodies of Crackers and Cookie. Crackers slits the throat of one chicken and the blood gets all over the two of them. Cotton watches all of this from the window of the shed, shuddering in ecstasy.Immediately afterwards, the Egg Man pays a visit to the trailer, calling out as he arrives. Edie hears him and becomes excited, screaming out for him as if she's afraid he will not stop otherwise. Cotton arrives and invites the Egg Man to Babs's birthday party, then she buys all of the Egg Man's eggs for Edie.Back at the Marbles, Raymond and Connie are making love by sucking each others toes, and we can see that their pubic hair is dyed to match the bright blue and red color of their hair. A phone call from Cookie interrupts them and she gives them the information she has collected about Divine's living arrangement and her birthday party. ""You have no idea what I had to go through to get that information!"" she tells them. The Marbles are thrilled that they know personal details about Divine, and they send her a surprise package in the mail--the address simply reads ""Babs Johnson, A Trailer, Phoenix, Maryland"".At the trailer, Divine prepares the steak she shoplifted and feeds it to her family. A postman (Bob Skidmore) interrupts their dinner, and Divine confronts him angrily, furious that someone has dared to approach the trailer. When he runs off, she unwraps the package to discover human excrement inside. A birthday card announces that Divine is no longer The Filthiest Person Alive. Divine flies into a rage, swearing vengeance for the obscene gesture.Connie and Raymond kidnap Linda (Linda Olgeirson), another young woman, after picking her up while hitch-hiking. They drug her and have Channing place her in the basement, where Susie begins to rant at him again. Channing, who is disgusted that part of his job is to have sex with unconscious women and get them
pregnant, has devised a new method: he masturbates into his hand and uses a syringe to inject the semen into Linda's vagina.Things progress. The Egg Man proposes marriage to Edie and she accepts, and he promises to take her to a large poultry factory for their honeymoon. The birthday party goes ahead as planned, with scores of guests indulging in all sorts of decadent behavior. Raymond and Connie, aware of the party, sneak up into the woods and watch from a distance as Divine snorts drugs with a friend, a woman performs a striptease with a snake, and in one of the movie's most memorable moments, a nude man throws his legs over his head an demonstrates his unusual ability to make his anus dilate rapidly over and over. Raymond and Connie are shocked at this display, and promptly phone the police to report Divine's party. The police arrive, but Divine and her group assassinate them with their bare hands, ripping their bodies apart and eating them raw as in ""Night of the Living Dead"".Connie and Raymond, gloating over the fact that they've called the cops on Divine, return home to discover Channing dressed in Connie's clothes, imitating both Raymond and Connie. Furious, they lock him in his ""room"", which is really just a closet. They then set out for their final act of vengeance: to burn down Divine's trailer. Raymond finds time to stop at the local park to commit another act of indecent exposure, but he is horrified when his victim, a lovely young woman putting on makeup in the park, opens her dress to reveal that ""she"" has male genitals. She laughs with glee as Raymond runs off.Divine and Crackers, having learned of the Marbles through gossip, invade the Marble residence, licking the furniture and rooms to ""curse"" the house. To further contaminate the dwelling, Divine and Crackers commit an act of incest, with Divine performing oral sex on him. They are interrupted by the sound of Channing, still locked inside the closet. They tie him up and intimidate him into telling them about Connie and Raymond. He also mentions the girls in the basement, and they take him downstairs to verify it. Sure enough, the imprisoned girls are there. Divine and Crackers disapprove of this variety of depravity committed by the Marbles, and they free the girls, allowing them to castrate Channing as an act of revenge.Meanwhile, the Marbles invade Divine's trailer, now empty due to Edie's departure with her new husband. They pour gasoline all over and ignite it, delighting in their final act of aggression toward their enemy. After the Marbles run off, Divine returns with Crackers and Cotton to find the trailer ablaze. Beside herself with sorrow and rage, she sets out to seize the Marbles immediately.When the Marbles return home, they discover their house has been contaminated. Their sofa and chair ""reject"" Connie and Raymond, spitting them onto the floor when they try and sit. The rest of the house reacts similarly as the Marbles walk through it in a panic. Discovering Channing's ""room"" empty, they wonder if he's set the girls free. In the basement pit, they find Channing's body, castrated and bled out. The girls are gone.Connie and Raymond assume the girls have sent for the police and they try to flee, but Divine, Cotton, and Crackers are waiting for them in the living room. They abduct the Marbles, tying them up and taping their mouths shut, and drag them back to the site of the trailer for a ""trial"" and execution.Divine summons the local tabloid press for exclusive coverage of the event. Representatives from three tabloids arrive and witness the mock trial for Connie and Raymond. Crackers and Cotton provide testimony and pronounce the verdict and punishment: guilty, with the death penalty to follow. After tarring and feathering the bound couple, Divine executes them with a handgun.The reporters thank her for the scoop and depart to write their articles, while Divine has a discussion with Cotton and Crackers about their next move. They decide to change their appearances and move to Boise. Mr. J discusses their reputation in the last scene of the movie, which depicts the trio preparing to leave Baltimore for Boise. Divine spots a small dog moving its bowels, and in one movement, she kneels down and picks up the excrement and puts it in her mouth, chewing it briefly before spitting it out. The camera zooms in for a closeup of her face as she smiles and ends the movie.Pat Moran...Patty Hitler (Party Guest In Nazi Uniform)Jack Walsh...Party GuestJackie Sidel...Party GuestJulie Munshauer...

tt0069097,"['Comedy', 'Romance']","Allan Felix (Woody Allen), a San Francisco film critic, watches the final scenes of the 1942 film 'Casablanca' and finds himself inspired by the manliness and selflessness of the character of Rick Blaine, played by Humphrey Bogart. Soon, however, he reverts to his typical neuroses and insecurity, and recalls the recent departure of his wife Nancy (Susan Anspach), who left him to experience a more exciting life. Wondering how to be more self-confident, Allan imagines Bogart (Jerry Lacy) sitting in his room, advising him to treat women like dames.Later, Allan is visited by his best friends, overworked businessman Dick Christie (Tony Roberts) and his wife Linda (Diane Keaton), a model. Although Dick tries to convince Allan that Nancy's exodus means Allan is free to play around, Allan complains that he has no luck with women. As Linda, another neurotic, and Allan commiserate and compare medications, Dick obsessively calls his office to report on his exact whereabouts. Although Dick and Linda love each other, she feels abandoned by his constant work schedule.The next day, Dick suggests a double date, and when Allan insists on a blonde with large breasts, Linda points out that girls who look that way often do not have great minds. As Allan imagines Nancy on the back of motorcycle complaining about him to her new boyfriend, Linda decides to invite her photographer's assistant, Sharon Lake (Jennifer Salt), to dinner. Allan is immediately overwrought with excitement.At home, as Allan worries about the possible outcomes of the evening, Bogart materializes and recommends that he remain cool and calm. Allan imagines himself winning over Sharon with his manliness, but by the time of the date, he is verging on hysteria. Desperate to appear cool, Allan repulses Sharon with his bizarre utterances and uncontrollable clumsiness. Although he is convinced that she likes him, at the end of the evening she shuts her door in his face.Over repeated phone calls, Allan and Linda discuss his chances with women, and she suggests that he date her friend Jennifer. That date is even worse, however, as she calls herself a nymphomaniac but then refuses to allow him to kiss her.Allan and Linda go to the museum, where Linda admires his intensity, which is so unlike Dick. Allan asks out a beautiful girl, undeterred by her announcement that she plans to commit suicide that weekend.A few days later, Allan, Dick and Linda take a vacation at the beach. Allan and Linda go to a nightclub, but the gorgeous woman on the dance floor rejects his advances. While Dick attends endless meetings, Linda and Allan enjoy each other's company. She urges Allan to be himself with women, and, knowing it is her favorite animal, he gives her a plastic skunk for her birthday, which she treasures. Dick later reveals to Allan that Linda feels neglected, but that he is too busy to dote on her.Dick sets up Allan with a woman from his office, Julie, and on their date Julie insists on entering a biker bar. There, two rough men harass them and Allan ineffectually attempts to protect his date. Meanwhile, Linda learns that he is on a date, and is surprised to find that she is jealous. When Allan returns, bedraggled and bruised, his comments about the date reduce her to tears of laughter. Back in the city, both Allan and Linda wander their respective homes feeling lonely.One night, Linda comes over, suffering an anxiety attack because Dick is away on a business trip. As they walk in the park, she suggests dinner and movie, and he immediately imagines them kissing. Realizing that he is in love with her but that, as his best friend's wife, she is off-limits, he is torn between lust and guilt.In a local grocery store, Allan pictures Bogart encouraging him to come on to Linda while Nancy insists that Dick will beat him up, then hopefully imagines Dick asking him to look after Linda while Dick leaves to live with his new Eskimo lover.At home, Allan first prepares a romantic meal for Linda, and then, envisioning her screaming as he tries to kiss her, quickly snuffs out the candles. When Linda arrives she has taken Librium and is light-headed. Nervous, Allan tries to talk her in to leaving the apartment, but when she asks if he believes it is possible to love two people at once, he hears Bogart urging him to kiss her. He does not respond quickly enough, and when he tries again later, the kiss is interrupted by a phone call from Dick. Linda, who is becoming drunk, tells Allan she could only cheat on Dick if she were in love, and Bogart reappears to push Allan into making a move. As Allan apprehensively compliments Linda, he imagines Nancy entering and shooting Bogart. Confused, he lunges at Linda, who pulls away and rushes out. Allan is berating himself when she comes back in and kisses him. They make love, and the next morning discuss how to tell Dick. Allan brings Linda home then walks back to his apartment, feeling uncharacteristically cocky and gregarious.Buying Linda a music box, Allan runs into Nancy in a store and handles the meeting with aplomb. Later, he frets about how Dick will take the news, imagining him having three different responses: first understanding, then killing himself, then killing Allan. Dick is waiting outside Allan's apartment, and there confides that he is afraid Linda is having an affair. Seeing his friend's distress and repentance, Allan calls Linda to instruct her not to leave him, but she is already telling Dick that their marriage is over.When Dick leaves for the airport in response, Linda follows in a cab and Allan rushes after them. In his mind, his cab driver is Bogart, who demonstrates how to let a ""dame"" down easily, then declares he is proud of Allan for his selflessness. At the airport, the three get to the gate at the same time. Allan tells Linda they must call it off, but she has already reached the same conclusion, and thanks him for helping her realize she still loves Dick. Thrilled finally to have a chance to say the words, he recites the lines from the parting scene of Casablanca , in which Rick tells Ilsa that she will regret not following Victor onto his plane, ending with ""Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life."" Allan then reassures Dick that although he tried to seduce Linda, she rebuffed him.As Dick and Linda walk off into the fog, Allan is joined by Bogart. Allan has finally realized that he can attract a woman by being himself, and so bids farewell to Bogart, who says admiringly, ""Here's looking at you, kid."""
tt0069113,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","The SS Poseidon, a trans-Atlantic passenger steamship slated for retirement, is making its way across the Atlantic from New York City to Athens on its last voyage. On the bridge, company representative Linarcos (Fred Sadoff) orders the ship's master, Captain Harrison (Leslie Nielsen), to empty ballast and proceed at full speed, against the Captain's better judgement.Meanwhile, Detective Lieutenant Mike Rogo (Ernest Borgnine) and his ex-prostitute wife Linda (Stella Stevens)--seasick, like much of the passengers--receive an invitation to the captain's table. Reverend Frank Scott (Gene Hackman), a priest questioning his faith, delivers an unnerving sermon at Sunday service. Susan Shelby (Pamela Sue Martin) and her younger brother Robin (Eric Shea) are traveling to meet their parents. Robin is interested in how the ship works and frequently visits the engine room. Retired hardware store owner Manny Rosen (Jack Albertson) and his wife Belle (Shelley Winters) are going to Israel to meet their two-year-old grandson for the first time. Haberdasher James Martin (Red Buttons) is a love-shy, health-conscious bachelor. The ship's singer, Nonnie Parry (Carol Lynley) rehearses for the New Year celebration with her band, which includes her brother Teddy on drums.That evening, New Year's Eve, everybody gathers in the dining room to celebrate. Captain Harrison is called back to the bridge because of an emergency report of an undersea earthquake near Crete. Harrison receives word from the lookout that there is a huge wave heading towards them. He immediately issues a mayday, but it is already too late. The wave hits the bridge, drowning Harrison, Linarcos and other ship's officers. The ship rolls over, killing and injuring most of the people on board.After the capsized derelict steadies, the surviving passengers and crew in the dining room take stock of their predicament. Robin looks for his sister, who has ended up under a table attached to what is now the ceiling. Scott assembles a team to hold a tablecloth that will cushion her fall and coaxes Susan to jump to safety. Acres, an injured waiter, is trapped at the galley door now high above them. Scott seizes on this, saying that rescue will be found 'upwards', at the outer hull, which is now above water. Robin confirms this, telling the group that the steel plating near the aft propeller shaft is just one inch thick. After some more talking and discussing, Manny, Belle, Mike, Linda, Nonnie, Susan, Robin, Acres, and Martin reluctantly agree to go with Scott. The group need something to climb up to Acres, so they eventually agree to use the Christmas tree as a makeshift ladder. Scott tries to convince more passengers to join his group, but all remain where they are in hopes of rescue.Just after the small group reaches the galley, there is a series of explosions and seawater begins to flood the ballroom. The survivors left behind rush to the Christmas tree, but the weight of everyone trying to climb at once pulls it over into the rising water. Scott, the last to leave, sadly closes the kitchen doors on the desperation below.Acres and Scott find the galley, but a warning light is on and the fire door, hot to the touch, has been shut. Scott enters the incinerated kitchen to investigate, returns, and the survivors pick their way through to a staircase on the other side. Scott climbs the ramped underside of the stairs first and he and Martin use a salvaged firehose to pull Rogo and Acres up. While Rogo pulls the others up, Scott and Acres go ahead and find the only exit to 'Broadway' (the main passageway of the ship) is blocked. Acres suggests an access tunnel to the funnel shaft. Scott undogs the opening and returns for Linda, Martin and Nonnie. Just then, water floods the staircase and the now-panicked survivors race to the tunnel.Temporarily safe, Scott leads them to an access tunnel. Rogo had been instructed to look after everybody but, just as Martin and Nonnie climb into the hole, water begins to fill the corridor. They make it into the funnel and began to climb up with Acres above them. Suddenly, the ship rocks from another series of explosions and Acres falls into the churning water and is lost. Rogo makes an attempt to save him, but the shaft explodes and forces him to abandon Acres.While climbing out of the shaft and into 'Broadway', Scott and Rogo argue heatedly over the loss of Acres when their group meets a larger band of survivors. These are led by the ship's medic and are heading towards the bow. Rogo argues with Scott about which direction to go and gives Scott only fifteen minutes to go aft to find the engine room. Everybody else looks for supplies. Scott and Susan (who has a crush on the charismatic Reverend) find the hatch that leads to the engine room. Scott tells Susan to return to the others and go forward if he's not back in five minutes. After waiting, Susan tells the others the bad news, but Scott reappears and announces he has found the way to the engine room.While Susan shows the survivors where to go, Scott notices that Robin is missing. He finds Robin just as the water begins to flood Broadway. They race to the hatch and make it up just as the water floods the corridor.The group finds the engine room is on the other side of a flooded corridor, so someone must swim through with a line so the others can find a way across. Belle, a former trained swimmer, claims that she could swim under it, but Scott refuses and dives in with the line. Halfway through, a panel collapses on Scott and traps him. The survivors notice something is wrong and Belle dives in to save him. She finds Scott and they make it to the other side. As Scott secures the lifeline, Belle suddenly has a heart attack and collapses. With her last breath, she tells Scott to give her ""Chai"" pendant (representing the Hebrew sign for life) to her husband who in turn will give it to her grandson. Scott weeps at her loss.Rogo swims over during the delay to make sure Belle and Scott are okay. When he surfaces, he sees Belle's death, and returns to the other side. Rosen suspects something is wrong and swims to the other side only to find his wife's lifeless body. A few minutes later, the others make it across and find Manny in tears. Initially he is unwilling to go on, but Scott gives him Belle's Chai pendant, reminding him that he still has a reason to live.Scott continues aft and finds the propeller shaft room's watertight door 'below' a steam valve. He returns and leads the survivors across a catwalk to the door, but there is another series of explosions and Linda falls to her death, presumptively of a broken neck. An infuriated and heartbroken Rogo blames her death on Scott, calling him a ""lying, murderous son-of-a-bitch.""More explosions rupture a large pipe which releases clouds of scalding-hot steam that block the group's path to their escape. Scott, outraged about the three deaths and this final obstacle, screams at God that he has betrayed the survivors. He leaps and grabs onto the burning-hot valve wheel to shut off the escaping steam. Hanging from it, Scott slowly turns off the steam, all the while cursing God. The helpless Scott tells Rogo to lead the group on, then lets go of the wheel and is lost to the flaming, oily water below. Susan, in anguish, tries to follow him.Rogo finally leads the remaining survivors--Rosen, Martin, Nonnie, Susan and Robin--through the watertight door and into the propeller shaft room, but they find no rescuers. Suddenly, they hear a noise outside the ship. They bang on the metal hull to get the rescuers' attention and, after several frantic attempts, finally get a response. The rescuers cut a hole through the hull using a blow torch and help the group from the ship. The survivors, the only six alive after the disaster, fly off to safety by helicopter."

She insists that Cheryl wash ""that paint"" off before joining her for dinner, and lectures her on the evils of sex. Cheryl plays along for a place to stay, but she soon finds out that the hotel is full of loonies of all types.

He dresses it like Cheryl and attaches a closeup photograph of Cheryl's face to the doll's head. He then gets in bed with it and simulates sex, climaxing with a bizarre moment: he draws a syringe of blood from his body and injects it into the doll.Judy shows up at the hotel looking for Cheryl and is murdered while nosing around in the basement. Eventually we learn that Alice, the girl who used to live at the hotel, has met with the same fate, after becoming the object of George's strange affection.Finally all is revealed. Aunt Martha is the one who has gone machete-happy, murdering anybody who interferes with her notion of morality, as well as anybody who will go near George, who is her child. Note that George is not her son--George is actually female, urged by Aunt Martha to avoid embracing feminine wiles. This explains George's need for a syringe to complete the sex act, as well as his unstable condition. It is also suggested that Aunt Martha is not really a woman herself, but rather a man who has adopted the opposite gender to avoid the moral pitfalls of being male.Before Cheryl can fall victim to George and Martha, Jeff and his father intervene with some rather inept policemen. The film concludes as we learn that Cheryl has taken over Aunt Martha's hotel. Has she also taken over Aunt Martha's strange outlook on life?"

tt0069186,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery', 'Romance', 'Thriller']","In a prosperous small provincial town in Southern Italy, a naked woman is discovered murdered and mutilated. By her body are a number of photographs of her having sex with her lover, his face having been cut out. At the morgue, the chief pathologist suggests to the detective in charge of the case, Inspector Capuano, that the victim was killed almost instantly by a from an open blade razor to the neck, the subsequent blows being the result of a homicidal fury. A fellow police officer is of the opinion that, due to the circumstances surrounding the murder, especially the presence of the photographs, they are dealing with a maniac. Capuano considers having the pictures of the lover blown up so that all his physical details can be logged, but rejects the idea as impractical, not least because the victims husband is a general with very powerful political connections, meaning that any investigation must be handled very delicately. It is decided in the meantime to arrest members of the local criminal fraternity and determine any links, no matter how tenuous, with the case. Despite intensive questioning of suspects, no new information is yielded and so Capuano returns home to his wife. She is worried about the effect his latest investigation is having on him, while he complains about the wall of silence surrounding the case, meaning that he cannot perform his duties properly. He also believes that the killer is very likely to strike again. Out in the countryside, a woman cavorting with her lover is covertly photographed by a figure whose features are obscured by gloves, a hat and heavy overcoat. Later, at a secret hideaway, the couple finish having sex. The lover bemoans having to leave, but is reminded that the woman must also leave so that she can host a bridge game organised by her husband. Shortly after he leaves, and she begins to dress, the villa is plunged into darkness and an attack is launched by the figure seen photographing the couple earlier. The woman manages to escape her assailant and makes it onto a nearby beach, before succumbing and being hacked to death by a razor. The killer scatters photographs over her body. The next morning her boyfriend is reassured by his lawyer that he has nothing to fear from the resulting police investigation, since his face had been removed from the photos. He is advised that because of the victims powerful husband, the police will not pursue the case too forcefully and that he should continue with his life as normal. Detective Capulano and the pathologist discuss the connection between the two murders and mull over possible motives for the crimes, including jealousy and psychosis brought about by impotence or homosexual rage. The detective hears strange laughter coming from the morgue and is taken inside by the pathologist. There they encounter, Gastoni, the morgue assistant who takes a strong pride in his work as an embalmer and whose laughter is the result of perfectly restoring a corpses former beauty. As they leave, the assistant is heard muttering something about forgiveness for sins. The next day, the police mount a surveillance operation on the latest victims funeral, filming those present. Nothing untoward is found. The following day, in a beauty salon, some of the well-to-do women of the town discuss recent events, and are concerned as to who could be the next victim. At a meeting with the Police Commissioner, Capuano admits that he has hit a dead end with the investigation, since the only suspects that he has are considered untouchable because of their social standing and political connections. He decides to continue the case nevertheless, convinced that the killer will strike again and possibly make a mistake. He is warned to tread carefully by his superior. Meanwhile, in a wooded area, two lovers are photographed as they make love in a car"

A young lady in her early twenties and her husband pull up in their 1969 Ford Country Squire Station wagon to a lavish upstate New York home on a lake, near the town of Ilium, believed to be the fictional title for the actual city of Schenectady. She frantically knocks on the front door calling for her father and no response. She peers through all the windows of the lavish home and sees nothing. Then she lets herself in the back of the home in the utility room desperately searching for her father.In the basement of his home, Billy Pilgrim, a balding, bespectacled, mild-mannered, and passive man of 45 years of age is typing a letter to his local daily newspaper of his time travels and how he is uncontrollably traveling from one point of his life to the other, being ""unstuck in time"". While he is typing his letter, he finds himself at the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium in January 1945, at the age of 22 alone and running through the snow. He is not dressed as a soldier at all, no weapon, and wearing a stocking cap, overcoat, sweater, and pants that are nothing suggesting Army attire. He is kidnapped by two brash, uncouth, mean, and very stupid men of his age, fellow soldiers named Paul Lazzaro and Roland Weary. They immediately think he's a German, but he denies it and they soon forget about it, since there's an attack going on. The men's Corporal abandons them and Lazzaro swears revenge.Briefly, Billy finds himself back on planet Tralfamadore in the geodesic dome with beautiful, 20-something porn star queen, Montana Wildhack and she suspects he's time traveling again and wants to give him a kiss to help forget about it. Simultaneously, Billy is back at the Battle of the Bulge and Paul Lazzaro hears him say ""a little kiss"" and Lazzaro is outraged beyond rationalization and accuses Billy of being homosexual, violently attacking him. Shortly after, two German guards take them at gunpoint tell them to get up and for Weary to give up his bootsIt is the summer of 1946, at Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Billy and his annoying and overweight new bride, Valencia Merble Pilgrim, are on their honeymoon. She thinks he had girlfriends during the war, but was glad they waited to have sex and that he married her. Billy seems bored by her doting and chit-chatting .Back to January 1945, Billy, Weary, and Lazzaro are marching with many other soldiers throughout war-torn remains of an unidentified town in Belgium, France, or Germany. Billy is flirted with by two young prostitutes while marching and bumps into Weary, stepping on his gangrene-riddled feet from wearing no combat boots. Lazzaro is furious and beats up Billy for it. Two German officers spot Billy for his clumsiness and bring him over to pose for a photo. Simultaneously, the portrait flashes forward to 1955-1958 with Billy and his family dedicating a new Ilium Optometry Center. Afterwards, an ill, senile, and shell-shocked Colonel named Wild Bob is escorting the men onto the train bound for a POW camp and fails to realize his men are not there. Billy enters the boxcar and goes to sleep. After pulling the covers on his head, it is the Spring of 1946 and he is in a veterans hospital being treated, allegedly for shell-shock or a nervous breakdown. His southern-accented and sweet-natured mother is talking to fellow patient, Elliot Rosewater of Billy's experiences. Soon afterwards, Billy is back in the boxcar with fellow soldier Weary blaming him for his death from gangrene. Paul Lazzaro cradles him in his arms and he dies. Billy finds himself back in the veterans hospital being given shock treatment.The steam locomotive train pulls up to a POW camp somewhere in Germany. Billy is given a blue, fur-collared overcoat way too small for him by German soldiers as a joke. The men are processed by a German officer and led into a shower room to be deloused. Afterwards, Billy finds himself as a little boy of about 6 or 7 in the shower at the YMCA and his father takes him out of the shower and throws him into the pool to ""sink or swim"".Billy and other soldiers are being marched to the mess hall and given a jovial welcome by English officers singing ""The Yanks are Here"". They are led into a dining room decorated with candles and with a potluck of potato soup, hot bread, pies, and marmalade. The English officer escorting Billy tells him the coat was a joke and to wear it with pride and how to hold his head high, despite the deplorable circumstances. Billy passes out at the suggestion.With the tune of the Andrews Sisters singing Johnny Fedora, Billy is at his new home in Ilium in spring and summer of 1947 playing with his new puppy, Spot, with his wife calling him for dinner twice. There is a party going on at his house a later night celebrating his new baby daughter, Barbara. He's obviously feeling out of place at the party with disinterested attendees and his wife chewing him out for the dog peeing on her leg. He takes the dog outside, sits at the lake, and sees a strange occurrence in the night sky, a beam of light coming to him, then leaving.It's back to the POW camp. Paul Lazzaro threatens Billy for Weary's death, but fellow soldier Edgar Derby intervenes. Derby is a middle-aged man of 44 years of age that gave up his job as a trade school teacher in Boston to fight in the war. He is a father figure to Billy and the two immediately form a close bond and friendship. Derby goes through Billy's coat and finds a partial denture and diamond of at least 2 carats.It is Billy and Valencia's anniversary at their home in the summer of 1964. He gives his wife a ring made by the diamond found in his coat. Billy is bored by the crowd and retreats inside his home. He catches his son in the bathroom looking at a porn magazine and scolds him for it. But afterwards, Billy looks at the magazine himself, smiling with delighted interest at the centerfold of Montana Wildhack and goes to the bedroom with it.Billy finds himself back at the POW camp in the briefing room with the rest of the soldiers to be told about the men's new assignment in Dresden and how lucky they are. Edgar Derby is nominated as their leader. Simultaneously, when Derby gives an acceptance speech, Billy is at a Lions Club meeting at his hometown in 1957 giving an acceptance speech.It's about 1964 or 1965 and Billy and his family are watching a soft-core porn flick with Montana Wildhack in it. Billy's son enjoys it and his wife is outraged at the filth. Billy pays no attention to her and is engrossed in it.Billy and fellow soldiers are in a boxcar on their way to Dresden and Derby is going over with him a letter he wrote to his wife about his service and about his pride in his son also serving in the South Pacific.About 1965 or 1966, Billy and his wife pull up to a cemetery with a police officer that caught his now-delinquent son and others vandalizing the tombstones and offers to pay off the officers for the damages.The soldiers pull up to the train station at Dresden, being led by an elderly German officer and several teenage proteges under his wing. They are marched to their new quarters through the beautiful city. A group of kids surround Billy while they are marching and an outraged elderly German civilian slaps him in the face, believing he is insulting his people with the coat he is wearing.It is February of 1968. Billy and fellow optometrists, to include his father in law, are about to take a chartered flight to Montreal for a convention. Billy sees visions of skiers in the crowd when waving goodbye and tells the pilots they need to stop the plane, because it will crash. They refuse to acknowledge, but the plane does crashBack to Dresden, the elderly German officer tells them of their quarters, Slaughterhouse Five, where they will be staying and what to shout in German in case of emergency.Billy is buried in the snow in the Green Mountains and a group of skiers find him bloodied and buried in the rubble.Billy's wife frantically pulls her 1967 Cadillac out of the driveway after hearing the news and comes to his rescue. She is so distressed that she misses her turn, backs into a Mercedes, drives the wrong side of the road, and causes numerous damage in vehicle accidents. She escapes the police, gets on the right side of the road, and goes forward, despite the fact the exhaust is ruined and spewing carbon monoxide. There is a brief flashback of Billy giving his wife the car for her birthday maybe a year or two earlier. Then the car pulls up to a hospital in Vermont and she crashes it into the garage, passed out from the carbon monoxide. Two nurses rescue her and bring her inside, with the gurney she's on passing the one Billy is on.Billy is being operated on and simultaneously, he and the fellow soldiers are in their slaughterhouse quarters being briefed about their working assignments by the German officer and daily routine of work. After the operation is over, the doctor that operated on Billy greets his daughter Barbara that everything will be okay. Barbara's husband Stanley comes over to her to give her the news that her mother died from carbon monoxide poisoning earlier.Billy is in his room recovering with an arrogant professor and historian for a roommate named B.C. Rumfoord telling his much-younger wife about being stuck in a room with such a weak and worthless man. He's writing a story on the bombing of Dresden and Billy says in a daze he was there, but Rumfoord couldn't care less. Simultaneously, Billy is blathering in German that he's an American Prisoner of War and Slaughterhouse Five. Rumfoord loses his temper and tells Billy the bombing was justified, while simultaneously, Billy as a young soldier is walking amidst a crowd of cheerful kids just hours before the bombing.The night of the bombing at dinner, an American dressed up in a Nazi uniform with American flag decor named Howard Campbell, is summoned to recruit the men for the Free American Corps, which is an allied unit with the Germans and that the Communists and Jews are their enemy. Derby calls him out on it for what a filthy traitor he really is, but before he can say anything more, an alarm goes off for the city and the men are ordered to evacuate to an underground cellar for shelter. Dresden gets bombed.In March 1968, Billy is taken home by his daughter Barbara and she pleads with him to stay with she and her husband, but he refuses. He is senile, listless, and apathetic at this point. He takes his elderly dog Spot and shuts the door in her face.The bombing is over and the soldiers go up the stairs to inspect the damage. Simultaneously, Billy is walking upstairs in his posh estate to his bedroom with his dog in his arms. The men walk outside. A teenage German soldier guarding their group denounces the bombers as filthy pigs in German and runs to rescue his family, who were already killed and he burns to death searching for them.Billy is laying in bed at his home with Spot and his son Robert has come to visit him. The former delinquent is now a sharp Green Beret in the Army fighting in Vietnam home on emergency leave. Robert is caring of him and trying to have a conversation, but Billy is preoccupied with himself, looking out the window at the night sky, and uninterested at his visiting, but assures him he's proud of him. Right after Robert leaves, the beam of light he saw in the sky while at the lake at his house in 1947 reappears and takes him away. He and his dog Spot are whisked away to a geodesic dome on the planet Tralfamadore. He's confounded as to his appearance there. The Tralfamadorian elder tells him he can't see them because they live in the Fourth Dimension and that he can't leave the dome. No reason why he is there, he just is.Billy and the American soldiers are ordered by the elderly German officer to process the corpses from the rubble of the bombed Dresden city and to collect their personal remains. They are given a direct order that any looting or stealing will result in firing squad. While Billy and the soldiers are collecting the bodies, he's on Tralfamadore telling the elder about the bombing and how it affected him, but he's comforted and assured that everything that happens always has and always will happen and that the past, present, and future are always happening at the same time in their world, which also gets destroyed and destroys the entire universe because of a mishap with one of their test pilots.Porn actress Montana Wildhack has now been added to the exhibit with Billy in the dome and she's scared to death at first not knowing what's happening. The Tralfamadorian elder insists that they mate, but Billy insists on being a Gentleman with her and does not follow the order. But she lets him go to bed with her and they make love.Some days later after the bombing, Derby finds an undamaged figurine in the rubble that is an exact replica of one his son broke before. He's caught by German officers and shot to death by firing squad. Billy tries to stop it to no avail.Billy is back on Tralfamadore with Montana in her new wardrobe. He tells her of his wife, that the thing he liked best about her was her pancakes. They want to have a baby together.It is back to March 1968 when Billy's daughter was frantically searching for him in his house. He, his daughter, and son in law are at the dining room table and she really thinks he's lost his mind about Tralfamadore and his son in law suggests seeing a psychiatrist. He assures them that the Tralfamadorians do not see past, present, and future the way Earthlings do. And also reveals to them the disappeared porn star Montana Wildhack is the love interest there and that he's seen his death.It is an unspecified time, perhaps the early 2000's. An elderly Billy Pilgrim in his 80's addresses a crowd at a high rise in Philadelphia about Tralfamadore and their lack of concept about time. And that a fellow soldier from World War 2 is about to kill him. Paul Lazzaro is now also a very elderly man that lives in the area shooting him sniper-style and instantly killing him.Billy wakes up to find himself amongst the remains to Dresden in April 1945 with Lazzaro and fellow soldiers attempting to steal a grandfather clock. He's assured all the Germans have left, but when in the process of stealing, Lazzaro and the others leave, with the clock toppling on Billy. It turns out the German side of the war is over and Russian soldiers give Billy a drink to celebrate, which he gagsBilly and Montana have a baby on Tralfamadore, with the entire planet celebrating with an array of fireworks"
tt0069281,"['Mystery', 'Thriller']","Andrew Wyke is a wealthy, unhappily married country squire and writer of detective novels who delights in playing elaborate games. Aware that Milo Tindle, the struggling owner of two hair salons, is having an affair with his wife, Marguerite, Wyke invites him to his country manor house in Wiltshire. Wyke is also having an affair with a girl named Teija and is quite happy to divorce his wife. His main concern is that Tindle, a struggling businessman, will be unable to maintain Marguerite in the lifestyle to which she has become accustomed, and that she'll leave him and return to Wyke.Wyke suggests that Tindle steal some valuable jewelry and sell it in order to live happily with Marguerite, while Wyke will claim the insurance in order to live happily with Teija. When Tindle agrees, Wyke offers him a disguise in case of unexpected visitors and, dressed up as a clown and under Wyke's supervision, Tindle breaks into Wyke's manor house, blows open the safe and obtains the jewels.Wyke then reveals that he has lured Tindle into a trap whereupon he can legally shoot him as an intruder.Wyke's real grievance is that his wife has been having an affair with a working-class boy made good rather than a member of the upper classes like himself (Tindle's Italian origins make him even worse in Wyke's eyes). He looks upon Tindle as nothing more than a gigolo, ""a jumped-up pantry boy who doesn't know his place"". While Tindle begs for mercy, Wyke fires the gun and he falls to the floor.Two days later, in the evening, the eccentric but methodical Inspector Doppler comes to Wyke's house, announcing that he is investigating Tindle's disappearance. At first Wyke denies ever having had anything to do with Tindle but eventually admits to his meeting with him and the ""game"" they played involving the jewels. Wyke states that he did not really kill Tindle but had used blank bullets. His aim was to humiliate the man and teach him that becoming a member of the gentry requires breeding rather than just joining in. He maintains that, after recovering from the shock, Tindle left the house alive.In the course of searching the house, however, Doppler finds traces of blood, evidence of actual bullets being fired into the walls and Tindle's clothes in a wardrobe. Wyke panics at this stage and tries to get away when Doppler pins him down and reveals himself to be none other than Tindle in disguise.Tindle reveals that he wanted revenge for the way Wyke had humiliated him. Wyke expresses admiration for the way it was done, but Tindle is not prepared to leave it at that. For him, the whole charade has become something of a class struggle: Wyke's gentrified world plays games for amusement; but in Tindle's working-class world the game is a daily struggle for survival. He has therefore set up a new game, this time based on reality, and involving a real-life murder.Wyke's murder mystery novels revolve around an upper-class detective, St. John Lord Merridew, who has a ""nose for smelling out evil superior to anything in the force"". Merridew is always solving cases that leave the official detectives baffled. Tindle has always rejected this image, seeing the police as sharp-eyed professionals who know their job.Tindle tells Wyke that he met Wyke's mistress Teija. He killed her, buried her body and planted evidence around the house that would frame Wyke for the crime. Tindle further reveals that the evidence for Teija's murder is set to look as though Wyke had set it in plain sight to provoke the police; to incite them with the impression that Wyke holds a belief that the police are unintelligent and useless and will not see the evidence for what it is.When Wyke phones Teija's roommate Joyce she confirms that Teija's body has been found and that the police are on their way to question him.A distraught Wyke has thirteen minutes to find and destroy the proof linking him to Teija's murder before the police, led by the all-too-real Detective Sergeant Tarrant, arrive. Tindle reads out riddle-clues to the location and nature of the hidden evidence while Wyke frantically runs around the house, interpreting the riddles and finding the items.After Wyke barely manages to dispose of the evidence in time, Tindle reveals that the police are not actually on their way; the whole thing was a set-up. He further reveals that Teija is alive, that he knows she is only marginally involved with Wyke, and that she wholeheartedly approved of Tindle's plan to humiliate the unpleasant older man, who is impotent.Tindle then goes upstairs to retrieve Marguerite's fur coat, a sign that she is moving in with him for good. Wyke takes his revolver out of a nearby drawer. Having been humiliated himself, Wyke informs Tindle that he cannot let him leave and that he intends to kill him, this time for real.Tindle then tells him that he actually did go to the police in order to make a complaint about the earlier incident but that they are unlikely to do anything since they see him as ""some common little git who's been screwing the wife of a local nob and who got what he deserved."" However, if Wyke does kill Tindle, the police will now not believe that Tindle was there to rob the house. Wyke does not believe that Tindle talked to the police and shoots him through the torso.Within a few moments, a police car, with lights flashing, reaches Wyke's front door, and someone begins to knock. Wyke tries to retreat away from the window to avoid being seen, while Tindle, bleeding profusely and barely able to crawl, grabs the switch wired to the entirety of Wyke's large collection of mechanical toys, which come violently to life and attract the attention of the police. With his world coming down, Wyke realizes that he is ruined and the dying Tindle laughs and says mockingly, ""Andrew... be sure and tell them... it was only a bloody game."""

tt0069293,"['Drama', 'Mystery', 'SciFi']","This is the summary for the 169-minute English-subtitled dvd version.During the opening credits, the chorale-prelude in F minor by Johann Sebastian Bach is playing.Part One:Plants move gracefully through a flowing stream of water. A man, Chris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis), stands silently amidst lush plant life and a rippling lake, observing the living beauty of nature. He walks back through a field, past a lake next to a free-standing wooden house. He washes his hands in the lake as he hears a car approaching. An older man, Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetskiy), and his young son (Vitalik Kerdimun) get out of the car and are greeted by Chris' father (Nikolay Grinko), who tells them that Chris makes an hour-long walk each morning. While the boy starts to play with a girl already present, inside the house, Berton explains he wants to discuss something with Chris: they are getting confusing messages from a station in orbit around the planet Solaris, to which Chris himself is scheduled to leave the next day. It begins to rain, but Chris remains outside, immersing himself in the falling drops with a background of singing birds and dripping water.While drying himself in the house, Chris is shown an old video from Berton, one which his father has already seen many times. In the video, a board of inquiry discusses an exploration mission on the planet Solaris. After 24 days, two scientists, Vishnyakov and Fechner, went missing over an ocean in their air vehicle. Due to adverse weather conditions, a massive search was called off, only Berton's craft carried on. When Berton returned to base, he arrived in deep shock, refusing to get near the ocean ever again. The next part of the video shows a young Berton giving his testimony: due to the adverse flying conditions, his craft had entered an extremely dense fog bank. When he finally cleared the fog, he noticed the ocean became still and transparent. A boiling substance arose from the water, and reshaped into many forms and colors, among which an elaborate garden. A film is started, made by Berton's craft, briefly showing the planet's ocean and some boiling white foam, but to everyone's surprise, the rest of the footage shows only the fog that Berton mentioned. One of the scientists on the board mentions that the bio-magnetic current of the ocean, which is hypothesized to be the planet's cerebral system, may have interfered with the camera, but others imply that Berton may have been imagining things. The next part of the video shows an apprehensive Berton describing a twelve feet high shape of an unknown newborn infant appearing on the water surface. The scientists, however, explained away this experience as an elaborate hallucination caused by the atmospheric influence of the planet; however, one of the scientists, professor Messenger (Georgiy Teykh), contends this explanation, and calls for additional probing of the planet. It is implied by his argumentation that many years of study of the planet (called Solaristics) have actually yielded very little understanding of Solaris, as the researchers are painfully confronted with the limits of their knowledge. Despite professor Messenger's argumentation, the board decides to discontinue all research activities on the planet.Berton stops the tape, stating that his story is still ridiculed. He requests to talk to Chris alone, and will be waiting outside. Chris' father laments that he and Chris have seen each other so little over the years, but Berton insisted on coming on this final day before Chris is leaving. Berton's son, playing outside, is scared by the sight of a horse, a species he has apparently never seen before. Chris goes outside to talk to Berton. Berton claims that Solaristics has stalled since all that is done is theorizing. Chris is not interested in speculations, only in facts; all research should either be stopped, or more extreme measures taken to advance the field of Solaristics, like bombarding the planet with high-intensity radiation. Berton disagrees, as he is concerned how immoral science could destroy the planet. When Chris says that all science is, in essence, immoral (referring to Hiroshima), and suggests that Berton may have indeed been hallucinating that day, Berton angrily leaves by car. Father berates Chris for his cold attitude towards Berton, and reminds him that Chris will probably not be back before his own father's funeral.Chris' mother (Olga Barnet) is watching a program about Solaris; the ocean is still theorized to be a thinking substance, despite lack of conclusive evidence. Although there used to be place for 85 scientists at the station, all but three still remain: astrobiologist Sartorius, cyberneticist Snaut and physiologist Gibarian. The program is interrupted by a video call from Berton's car. Berton has one thing he wants Chris to know. After the incident, he and professor Messenger visited the widow and orphaned son of the deceased scientist Fechner. Fechner's son looked exactly the same as the child that Berton saw on Solaris' surface. Chris is listening in from the next room. Berton disconnects the call, and during his long car ride through a futuristic city, he seems mesmerized and visibly haunted by memories.Back at his parents' home, Chris is burning all books and papers related to his research which he no longer needs. He will be taking some personal videos. Chris' mother is crying as he puts a picture of a young woman in the fire. He makes one final round through the house as the horse walks by.Chris makes the trip to the planet, finally arriving at the circular space station that hovers miles above the ocean surface. Once inside the landing bay, there is no one to greet him. He proceeds, to find that the station is in disarray: wires are sticking out of the walls, some of the panels seem to be short-circuiting, and there is junk everywhere. He sees the door to Dr. Snaut's quarters, but there is no response to his knocking. He looks down a hall, and sees a human figure walking away; a children's ball is rolling towards him. He then finds Snaut (Jüri Järvet) in another room, singing. Snaut seems startled at the sight of Kelvin. He tells Chris that Sartorius is in his quarters, and Gibarian is dead by suicide. Chris knows Gibarian and is skeptical, but Snaut says Gibarian was suffering from a profound depression since an unnamed mysterious disorder began. Chris insists on meeting with Sartorius, but Snaut replies that Sartorius is in his lab and is unlikely to let Chris in. He shows Chris out, urging him to pick a room and come back tomorrow; he also warns him not to lose his head if he sees other people on board, but refuses to elaborate. Just before the door closes, Chris sees another man lying in a make-shift hammock.After picking a room, Chris goes to Gibarian's quarters. There is a child's drawing titled ""human being"" on the door. Gibarian's room is a giant mess, but there is a note addressed to Kelvin taped to a video screen. Chris starts the video and sees a recording of Gibarian (Sos Sargsyan) speaking to him. Gibarian assumes that the others have already informed Chris about his death. He has a warning for Chris, but can't explain what is happening; he fears it is only the beginning, and everyone will be affected. He assures Chris he has not gone mad; as for the research, he agrees with Sartorius that they can only break this deadlock and communicate with the planet by bombarding its oceans with high-powered X-rays, before it draws Chris in too. The door of the apartment starts to open; Chris becomes anxious, getting aware of another presence, takes the recording out and goes into the hallway towards the lab. He is drawn to a window and looks outside, but there is nothing in the vast darkness of space. He proceeds to the lab and knocks on the door, trying to reason with the doctor. Sartorius (Anatoliy Solonitsyn) agrees to come out, on the condition that Chris not enter. Sartorius is as nervous as Snaut, mentioning that Gibarian may just be the first victim. He had expressed his wish to be buried on Earth, in the dirt. Sartorius mentions that Fechner died a magnificent death in his search for truth, whereas Gibarian died a coward. Chris scoffs that such courage is mere inhumanity. Suddenly, the lab door opens and a dwarf runs out; Sartorius quickly picks him up and puts him back into the lab, stating that Kelvin is overemotional and should adapt.Kelvin leaves, noting that the windows, which were dark just before, are suddenly filled with light. Through them, he can see the ocean swirling below. A young woman in a short vest (Olga Kizilova) suddenly passes him by. He follows her through the station into a refrigerated room where he finds the dead body of Gibarian on a slab. He leaves again and returns to Dr. Snaut's quarters, telling him about his unfriendly talk with Sartorius. Chris asks if there are more people on the station, and if the young woman he saw was real; Snaut seems paranoid and asks Chris if he himself is real, refusing to answer more questions. Chris assures the doctor he doesn't believe him to be insane, but Snaut retorts that insanity would actually be a blessing.Chris leaves to his quarters, barricading the door from the inside. He resumes Gibarian's video message, in which the doctor voices his suspicions that the others think he is going mad. The young woman who Chris saw aboard appears next to Gibarian, but he pushes her away. He makes a paranoid impression, expressing his fear of the other two doctors and saying he 'has to do it'. When Snaut and Sartorius are heard knocking on the door in the video, urging Gibarian to come out, Gibarian picks up a syringe. He states he has not gone mad, his conscience is simply torturing him, implying the girl has something to do with it. He finally laments that Chris did not come earlier and stops the recording. Chris lies down on the bed, keeping a gun next to him, falling asleep. When he wakes up, he finds a woman (Natalya Bondarchuk) sitting in a chair nearby. She wears a mantle which she takes off, and puts it over a chair. She walks over to him and they kiss, but Chris is confused, unable to believe what he sees and asks her how she found him. The woman seems unaware of any problem with her presence. She finds a framed picture of herself among Chris belongings, and only realizes it is her while looking in the mirror. She seems not to remember having this picture taken. She asks if he loves her, but Chris, calling her 'Hari', says she already knows that. He asks her to stay behind for a short while, but she wants to stay with him at all times, despite his objections. She says he is as nervous as Snaut, confusing Chris even further. He invites her along, but asks her to put on a suit. She asks him for help with her dress: Chris finds that the dress won't open, and there is a tear in it at the arm, with a puncture mark in Hari's skin. He uses scissors to cut the dress open. Hari notices Chris' anxiousness as he sees that his door is still barricaded from the inside.Part Two:Chris takes Hari to the landing bay, where he readies a rocket from the station for departure. He urges her to enter it first under the pretense that he has to enter last to close it. After she has entered, he quickly traps her inside and starts the lift-off sequence. Despite her screams and pleas, Chris tries to leave but finds that he is locked inside the room. He tries to take cover underneath a blanket, but sustains some burns on his suit and face from the launch. Disturbed by his own action, he returns to his room and douses himself under a shower. Snaut enters, implying that he knows Chris had company and probing him about his response to the event. He seems to know fully well what Chris did with Hari and tells him not to panic 'next time'. Chris tells him the woman had died 10 years earlier. According to Snaut, she was a manifestation of his perception of her. The manifestations started after an experiment where X-rays were applied to the surface of the ocean. Snaut says that Chris is fortunate that his manifestation is a figure from the past, because it can also be an imagined person. Apparently, the ocean has probed the scientists' minds and extracted isolated parts of memory from it; more Haris will probably appear. Chris asks why Snaut did not warn him this would happen, but Snaut replies he would not have believed him anyway. Chris admits he was scared and acted wrongly, but quickly focuses on his task of liquidating the station, asking for Snaut's support. Snaut implies that this encounter with Hari is just what Chris may have always wanted. He attaches some paper to the air vents, an idea of Gibarian to simulate the sounds of leafs, as on Earth. He urges Chris to rest and meet him in the library later, to give him some books.Chris goes to sleep and has vivid dreams. He awakens thinking Snaut has entered the room. However, it is Hari who is back. She takes a pair of scissors and opens her dress herself, and puts her mantle over the chair, seemingly not surprised by the mantle and dress already present. Chris takes her in bed and acts as if everything is normal. Sometime later, Chris takes her mantle and dress, and exits the room, leaving Hari sleeping. He closes the door, but Hari immediately starts to pound on it from the other side, pushing herself through the metal door and severely lacerating herself. Chris quickly stuffs the dress and mantle in a corner and carries Hari onto a bed. He picks up something to tend to her wounds, but to his astonishment, the wounds on her arms have already closed within seconds. She sits upright and says that she panicked when she noticed that Chris was not around. There is a call on the phone from Snaut: he asks about the situation and says that Sartorius has summoned everyone to the laboratory. Hari has also noticed that her wounds have already healed, and is deeply disturbed by it.Snaut and Sartorius see Chris approaching as he shows Hari around the station. He lets her introduce herself. Sartorius explains that, while people are made of atoms, the Visitors are made out of neutrinos. Neutrino systems are inherently unstable, so the planet must send out a magnetic field that keeps them stable. Sartorius calls Hari an 'excellent specimen', but Chris really considers her his wife. Sartorius suggests that Chris take a blood sample from his so-called 'wife' to clarify some things.Chris finds out that Hari's blood keeps regenerating itself, as if she is immortal. Sartorius implies that Chris should try an autopsy on Hari, reasoning that the Visitors are inferior to lower animals on Earth. Chris is shocked, indicating that Hari feels pain as any human being, and warning Sartorius to stay away from her. Sartorius admits that he is somewhat jealous of the emotional contact between Chris and his Visitor. Chris sarcastically comments that this makes him feel guilty, and leaves.The liquid surface of Solaris is swirling violently. Chris shows Hari a home video made by himself and his father. It shows Chris as a boy, a woman and a man in a snowy landscape around their house. The film jumps several years ahead, showing an teenage Chris and his mother in the same setting during spring. It then shows Hari in winter, wearing the same dress and mantle as the Visitor Hari. After the film is finished, Hari looks in a mirror and says she does not know herself; as soon as she closes her eyes, she cannot remember her face. She suddenly remembers that the woman in the video hated her. Chris tries to assure her that this woman already died before he met Hari, but Hari is not fooled, as she remembers vividly how the woman told her to leave the house. Chris reveals that after that event, he was transferred for his work, and Hari refused to come with him; something she also remembers.Hari sleeps, but Chris can't. Snaut knocks on the door, and while bandaging his hand, he tells Chris that the rate of regeneration has slowed down, so they will be rid of the Visitors for 2 or 3 hours. He reasons that since Solaris extracts the Visitors from the scientists' minds during sleep, they should send their waking thoughts towards the planet by X-rays, which will hopefully stop the apparitions. Although Chris does not like the experiments with X-rays, Snaut proposes modulating the beam with the brain waves of Chris. However, Chris fears that the planet may read that he wants to get rid of Hari, and it will kill her. Both men do not realize that Hari is awake and hears everything. Snaut mentions that Sartorius is working on another project, something called the 'Annihilator', which can destroy neutrino systems. Chris feels this is blackmail, to get him to cooperate with the brain wave project. In order to make up, Snaut mentions tomorrow is his birthday, and that all are invited. He notices that it is worrying that Hari already knows how to sleep. He invites Chris to come with him to Sartorius, leaving Hari to sleep. As Chris leaves, Hari seems to sob under her blanket. At the lab, Chris suddenly says he forgot something, and returns to his quarters. He grabs Hari, hugs her passionately and asks her to forgive him. They kiss as clouds roll over the liquid surface of Solaris.Hari is standing next to the bed as Chris is waking up. She is apparently confused about her origin and claims Chris does not love her. Chris does not understand, so she explains that the real Hari poisoned herself, meaning she must be someone else. She is saddened that it Sartorius who told her the night before, and not Chris himself, and she does not want to continue this way, fearing for Chris' well-being. She asks him to tell her about the real Hari. Chris explains that at the end of their relationship, they quarreled a lot, and Chris left, even though he often thought of her. Chris implies that Hari threatened with suicide, but he left anyway, until he remembered that he had left an experimental liquid in the fridge. He went back, but Hari had already injected herself with this poisonous liquid. Visitor Hari is distressed when she sees a needle mark on her arm as well. She asks Chris why real Hari did it; Chris believes that she incorrectly thought he did not love her anymore. Visitor Hari says how much she loves him; he urges her to sleep, but she says that even her sleep feels unreal.In the library, everyone is waiting for Snaut. Sartorius, who is immersed in his books, says Snaut may be delayed due to more Visitors. Snaut arrives an hour and a half late, much to Sartorius' chagrin, and once again makes a very incoherent impression. He hands Chris a book from a pile for him to read out loud, while giving Hari a kiss on her hand. It is an excerpt from Don Quixote, where Sancho praises the blessings of sleep. Sartorius proposes a toast to Snaut's courage and devotion to science. Snaut responds that science is a fraud, and claims their present scientific problem won't be solved. He says mankind has no ambition to conquer the cosmos; Man simply wants to extend Earth's borders, wanting no others worlds, but only mirrors to see his own in. Attempts at contact with extraterrestrials is doomed to fail, as the goal is one mankind fears and does not need: ""Man needs Man"", he concludes. Instead, he proposes a toast to Gibarian, who was fearful. Chris does not agree, stating that he thinks Gibarian committed suicide because he thought he was alone in what happened to him, seeing no other way out. Sartorius counters this, claiming that nature created Man to gain knowledge in search of truth; he criticizes Chris for only showing interest in lying in bed with his ex-wife all day, and Gibarian for being contemptible. Snaut quickly quells the argument. Hari is visibly disturbed by the exchange of words; she claims that Chris is the only one displaying some humanity under inhumane conditions, whereas the other two do not seem to care and regard their Visitors as external enemies. She claims the Visitors are their conscience, and Chris may indeed love her, or show a humane reaction at the very least, unlike the others, who she resents. Sartorius becomes confrontational again, questioning her right of existence, as the real Hari is dead and she is a mere reproduction or copy. Hari acknowledges this, but says she is becoming human; she can feel and love, and can exist independent from Chris. She walks away, hurt by Sartorius' cruel words, and knocks over a chandelier. She tries to take a drink, but cannot swallow it, breaking down in tears. Chris tries to comforts her, much to Sartorius' disgust, who leaves. Snaut says that all the quarreling makes them loose their humanity and dignity. In tears, Hari says that each of them is human in his own way, and thats why they quarrel. Chris thanks Snaut for his continuing kindness. Snaut is inebriated; he says he is completely worn out and starts a walk with Chris. He says that he is entitled to get drunk for all the sacrifices he has made for the mission. He likens Sartorius with Faust, as he is seeking a way against immortality. They walk through the station, Snaut singing and talking gibberish about communicating with the planet. Chris wants to return as he left Hari alone in the library. Snaut warns him that the station is shifting orbit, so there will be 30 seconds of weightlessness at 1700 hours.Chris returns to the library, finding Hari sitting and smoking, lost in thoughts. She thinks of voices as she looks intensely at a painting in the library, depicting a lively winter landscape back on Earth. She has a brief memory of Chris as a boy, standing in the snow as well. Chris awakens her from her trance. Objects as well as Chris and Hari start to float due to weightlessness. They share a short moment of happiness amidst the art in the room as the gravity comes back.The planet surface starts to make boiling movements. There is a sound of something shattering as Chris finds Hari lying dead on the floor in the main corridor, having immersed herself with liquid oxygen. When Snaut enters the corridor, Chris tells him she killed herself out of desperation. Snaut says that it will get worse as she gets more human from being around Chris. Chris intends to wait until she revives, but Snaut warns him that Hari cannot live outside the station. Chris says he has no choice, as he loves her, but Snaut tells him that what he loves is just a scientific anomaly that can be endlessly regenerated, and implies he should do something about it. As he leaves, he says he could never get used to the continuous resurrections. The shock of the revival is apparently agonizing for Hari, as she convulses and realizes to her horror that she is alive again. Chris tries to calm her down, assuring that even if her presence is a torment from the ocean, she means more to him than all science ever could; but Hari goes into hysterics, repeating that she should not exist. Snaut suddenly runs past them with a box.Clouds evaporate from the swirling ocean. Chris puts Hari on the bed, and assures her he will stay with her on the station. They embrace and Chris falls asleep. He awakens, soaked in sweat. As if in a dream-like state, he wanders through the central corridor, finding Snaut looking outside. He says that the ocean seems to be more active due to Chris encephalogram. Chris makes some incoherent philosophical remarks about life, souls and suffering, and the nature of love as something inexplicable and perhaps the reason of human existence. Apparently feverish, he stumbles on, supported by Hari and Snaut. He surmises Gibarian did not actually die out of fear, but out of shame. ""The salvation of humanity is in its shame"", he proclaims. He is put to bed and has feverish dreams of his parental home, Hari, his mother as a young woman and his dog aboard the station. He has a conversation with his young mother in her home, as if he has just returned to Earth. The painting in the station's library is hanging on a wall in the house, and there are plastic sheets covering some of the walls. Chris tells her he almost forgot her face, and says he is unhappy and alone; his mother asks why he never called them. She asks him why he is seemingly neglecting himself. She notices stains on his arm, which she washes off. The reunion causes Chris to cry. He then awakens to the sound of Snaut boiling water. Snaut gives him a letter, saying Hari is gone. Snaut reads out her letter: she is sorry for deceiving Chris, but she saw no other solution. It was her decision, and none of the others are to blame. Snaut adds that she did it for him. Chris is shocked and asked how it went. Apparently, the Annihilator caused an explosion of light, and then a breath of wind. Chris tearfully reminds himself of all his quarrels with her the past few days, and asks why they are so tormented. Snaut replies that it is because Mankind, unlike his primitive ancestors, has lost his believe in greater Cosmic powers, and draws a parallel with the myth of Sisyphus (a Greek king punished by the Gods for his treachery and cruelty by having to do a task that he could never complete). Since Chris' encephalogram was sent down to the planet, the Visitors have stopped appearing, and now, islands are appearing on the ocean's surface. Chris believes that the planet may finally understand them now.Chris and Snaut continue their philosophical talk in the library. Chris asks if Snaut feels a clear link with the life below after so many years on the station. Snaut cryptically remarks that the meaning of life and other eternal questions only interest unhappy people, and such questions should be asked at the end of one's life; Chris still sees Hari's cloak hanging on a chair, and mentions mankind is always in a hurry since they never know when their life will end. The happiest people are the ones who never ask such questions; we question life to seek meaning, yet to preserve all the simple human truths like happiness, death and love, we need mysteries. Not knowing the date of your death practically makes one immortal.As clouds roll by, Chris is immersed in thought, narrating that his mission is over. There is now the option to go back to Earth and let everything be normal again, to resume his life. But he also thinks that is no longer a reasonable option. The other possibility is to stay, even for an imaginary possibility of contact with the ocean, which his race is desperately trying to attain. And perhaps hoping for Hari to return. But he has no more hope and can only wait for a new miracle.In the station, Snaut tells Chris that he thinks it is time for Chris to return to Earth. Chris questions this opinion, smiles and looks at the box which Snaut was carrying earlier. It contains a growing plant.Once again, plants are gracefully moving through a flowing stream of water. Chris is back on his parents' land, observing the lake which is frozen. He returns to the house where his dog is running to him. The fire outside where he burnt his books is still smoking. Looking inside the house, there is water dripping inside the living room. Chris' father is sorting books; as he moves under the drops of water, smoke comes off him. The old man notices Chris and goes outside. As Chris gets on his knees and hugs his father, the camera pulls back through the swirling clouds, revealing that the house, the lake and the surrounding land are lying on a small island amidst the vast ocean on Solaris.The End"
tt0069303,"['Drama', 'Family']","Rural Louisiana, 1933. Its twilight. A father is walking across open grassland with his son and a hound dog. The father, Nathan Lee/ Nathan (Paul Winfield), is carrying a rifle; the boy, David Lee/ David (Kevin Hooks in his first feature), holds a lantern. Soon its night. The dog spots a raccoon and gives chase. Nathan and David try to keep up, calling the dog's name. Sounder chases the raccoon through fields, underbrush, and finally up a tree. Nathan and David catch up, clearly savoring a meal for the night. Nathan raises his rifle and shoots. He misses and the raccoon escapes. He blames himself for not killing the raccoon.They return to an old dilapidated cabin. Rebecca (Cicely Tyson), Nathan's wife and David's mother, is waiting for them. Nathan tells Rebecca they lost the 'coon. She says nothing.Nathan tells David that since he had a tough night, don't go to school the next day. David replies, 'But I want to go to school.'
David, who is about twelve or thirteen, is sent to bed. Rebecca notices that before he went to sleep, he ate half a bowl of walnuts that she picked for trading. Nathan: 'The boy is hungry, Rebecca'.Rebecca goes to bed and calls for Nathan. Silence.The next morning David and his younger brother and sister wake up to the smell of meat cooking on the stove. 'Where'd it come from?' Neither Rebecca nor Nathan respond, but they enjoy the breakfast.
Rebecca washes clothes for a local white woman, Miss Boatwright (Carmen Matthews). David, his brother and sister deliver the laundry to Miss Boatwright. She pays for the laundry and gives David a copy of the Three Musketeers. 'When you're finished reading it, we'll talk about it, y'hear.'
Nathan is pitching at a softball game. All his family is watching. He gets the final out and wins the game for his team. Ecstatic, the family returns home. The local sheriff (James Best) is in their cabin. He emerges with a side of meat.
Nathan is handcuffed in front of his wife and children. He is pushed into the back of a pickup truck with a deputy and the truck drives away.
Growling, Sounder takes off after the truck. The deputy seated next to Nathan raises his rifle. Nathan attempts to kick the rifle out of the deputy's hand. The gun goes off. Sounder is hit and disappears into high grass. David gives chase but can't find him.
Rebecca tries to visit Nathan in jail. The sheriff won't allow it. Visitors only on Sundays and holidays; women, never.
Rebecca is in the grocery store. She barters walnuts for groceries. The store owner is Mr. Perkins (Ted Airhart), who also owns the land the family works on. Perkins lambastes Rebecca for what Nathan did-namely, making him, Perkins, look bad. In addition, who's going to sharecrop for him if Nathan is in jail?It's Nathan's sentencing. Though Nathan's family are the only spectator's in the courtroom, they are seated at the back. Nathan Lee Morgan is found guilty of 'unlawful trespass and robbery' and sentenced to one year of hard labor. The camp where he is to serve his sentence is not mentioned. Flanked by two white deputies, Nathan is whisked out of the courtroom. No goodbye, no contact at all is allowed with his family.
Life goes on. The children are helping Rebecca with the laundry, and David continues to look for Sounder.
Rebecca and the children go to the station to see Nathan. Rebecca sends David in with a chocolate cake and instructs him to find out what camp Nathan will be sent to.David sees Nathan behind bars. They are both happy to see each other. David hands his Daddy the cake through the bars. They eat and talk. Then Nathan says he doesn't want them to come and visit anymore.Rebecca and the children work the fields. David reads The Three Musketeers to his brother and sister.One Sunday two friends are at Rebecca's home after church, for a meal. Ike (Taj Mahal) is playing the resonator guitar and Harriet (Sylvia 'Kuumba' Williams) starts dancing. The pastor arrives. He had been down to the courthouse, but the police didn't tell him 'nothing' about what camp Nathan was taken to. He warns Rebecca not to be bitter, but, like he's said to other women with similar 'misery or trials,' take it to God.
David is working the fields and hears a dog whimpering. Sounder returns.David drops off another load of clean laundry to Miss Boatwright's house. He asks if she can find out what camp his Daddy was sent to. Miss Boatwright: The courthouse has rules about things like that, but I'll ask around town about it. David is unconvinced: I'll see you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright. Miss. Boatwright: I'll find out where your Daddy is for you...
goes through the sheriff's files, but the sheriff returns and catches her.Miss Boatwright asks the sheriff where Nathan is being held. He refuses to tell her. He leaves the room to answer a telephone call. David appears. Miss Boatwright
Miss Boatwright leaves. David suspects that she saw where his father is being held. She denies it.Miss Boatwright turns up at the Morgan's home. 'The camp where Nathan is being held is called Wishbone Labor camp...' She sits with Rebecca and the children and attempts to find the camp on a map.David sets out with Sounder and a map to find his Daddy.After traveling a great distance, through heat and rain, through fields and across creeks, he comes across a group of black prisoners and their guards. He asks a guard if he knows his father, Nathan Lee Morgan. The guard replies 'Never heard of him, boy.'
Through a fence, David asks a group of prisoners if they've heard of his father. A guard overhears David. He raises his billy club and brings it down hard on David's hand. David flees, Sounder in tow.David gets lost and comes across a schoolhouse with black children and a black teacher. The teacher, Camille Johnson (Janet McLaughlin), invites him in. He asks her if he can wash the blood off his hand. Miss Johnson invites him to stay for class, and invites him to her home afterwards for a hot meal, 'then we can talk about how we can get you back home.'At Miss Johnson's home, David notices her many books. She shows him books on Harriet Tubman and Crispus Attucks, and reads from a work by W.E.B. DuBois. David listens attentively. When she's finished, he smiles: You're a nice lady, Miss Johnson.The following day David attends Miss Johnson's class. A student, Clarence, tells a story about saving his sister from drowning. Another student says he doesn't believe the story because Clarence can't swim. David says he believes Clarence's story, because his family, like Clarence, had to do what seemed impossible to survive, simply because they had to do it. They had no choice.That evening Miss Johnson tells David that she believed Clarence's story as well. When he confides in her that he believes he's failed for not finding his Daddy, she encourages him not to think that way. Not many little boys could have done what you've done, she tells him. David asks if he can come back and study with the other children.David returns home with books Miss Johnson gave him. He tells his Mama about Miss Johnson's offer to teach him at her school. Rebecca replies: 'Who's going to help on the farm? Well, maybe by that time your Daddy'll be back -if it's all right with him it's all right with me.'
Rebecca is on the porch, sewing. Sounder is lying under the porch. Suddenly he springs to his feet and slowly walks out to the front yard, barking. In the distance a solitary figure approaches on foot. Sounder scampers towards the figure. Nathan hobbles on one crutch. The family rushes to meet him. He throws down the crutch and embraces them. 'What happened to your leg, Daddy?' David asks. Dynamite blast. 'When I wasn't no more use to them, they took some time off my sentence and let me come home.'Nathan is hit by a piece of machinery while working the field. He collapses and needs time to get back to his feet.Ike shows up with a letter. Mr. Perkins told him to bring it over. It's from Miss Johnson for David. If he's going to come to her school, he should be there in about a week. David tells his Daddy he doesn't want to go, 'Daddy, you just got home. I wanna stay home and be with you.' Nathan replies, 'I wanna be with you too, but school is something you need, something's good for you, like good air to breathe. And I want you to have it. And that's the way it's gonna be.' David defiantly refuses to go and runs away. Rebecca chides Nathan for being rough with David. Nathan goes after David. They meet at a nearby creek.Nathan tells David of the accident at the labor camp, and his determination to survive and return to his family. He says: 'I'm gonna beat this trouble in my leg. That's what I want you to do. I want you to beat the life they got laid out for you in this place. Son, don't get too used to this place, cause wherever you is I'm gon' love you...'"

As she uses her final wish to bring him back alive and will live forever, she discovers that he was embalmed, she tries to kill him to end his pain but because she wished him to live forever, every bit of him is alive and well, she has now trapped him in eternal pain.""Blind Alleys""Major William Rogers (Nigel Patrick), the new director of a home for the blind making up of mostly retired middle aged men, makes drastic financial cuts, reducing heat and rationing food for the residents, while he lives in luxury with Shane, his Belgian Malinois. When he ignores complaints and a man dies due to the cold, the blind residents, led by the stone-faced George Carter (Patrick Magee), exact an equally cruel revenge by locking the Major up in a room in the basement as well as subduing the staff of the facility. Carter and his men then begin constructing in the basement a maze of narrow corridors lined with razor blades. They also lock up and starve the Major's dog. They place the Major in the maze's center, release the dog and turn off the basement lights....After completing the final tale, the Crypt Keeper reveals that he was not warning them of what would happen, but telling them what had happened; they have all died, and it is too late for repentance. Clues to this twist can be spotted throughout the film, including Joan Collins' character wearing the brooch her husband had given her for Christmas just before she killed him. The door to Hell opens, and the visitors all enter. ""And now ... who is next?"" asks the Crypt Keeper, turning to face the camera. ""Perhaps you?"""
tt0069371,"['Mystery', 'Romance', 'Thriller']","The dead body of thirty-nine year old Jenny Campbell (Lee Pulford) is in the surf on the beach outside her isolated house in the ocean-front community of Eden Landing, California. By the wounds, it looks as if her Doberman, who is snarling as he hovers over her body, mauled her to death, specifically by going for her throat.This death is the biggest case for Eden Landing police chief, forty-year-old Abel Marsh (James Garner) upon his return from a week-long vacation in Los Angeles, where, rumor has it, he went ""to get some"" as the running gag is that there are no good-looking, available women in Eden Landing. Most of the time, Abel only has to worry about his department doing whatever little actual police work they have on no budget, which forces them all to use the two police cruisers on a rotating basis for their collective personal business. Meanwhile, their regional county sheriff, Captain Daniel Streeter (Harry Guardino), seemingly gets whatever he wants. Abel's first order of business on this case is to serve the notice to put down the Doberman, who is currently being housed at the professional compound of Abel's casual friend, veterinarian Dr. Warren G. Watkins (Hal Holbrook). This is a task which Abel is not looking forward to, if only because he doesn't like dogs. At the vet's office, he meets Warren's beautiful new nurse, thirty-year-old Kate Bingham (Katharine Ross), from whom he learns that the dog, named Murphy (Hans), is very well trained, but that there are documented cases of Dobermans killing their masters in such a manner. Warren further confirms that they can put Murphy down using a humane method of drugs, specifically sodium pentobarbital. The court order is rescinded, and the case turns into a double murder investigation when Abel learns from the coroner's office that Jenny died from drowning - in fresh water made to resemble salt water - and that Jenny was three months pregnant when killed. Murphy's actions at the beach were efforts to pull her out of the ocean and protect her body.During Abel's initial search through Jenny's home for clues, the house which looks as if a party had just been held in it, he seems most interested in the smell of the bathtub and a bottle of Cromarty, a single malt scotch in the liquor cabinet. He takes the bottle with him to consume himself at the diner owned by his friend Ernie (Arthur O'Connell), and he later learns Cromarty is not stocked at the local liquor store. He hears a noise sounding like someone else is in the house. He is only able to catch a glimpse of someone running away from the scene.At a private club, Abel speaks to Jenny's ex-husband, wealthy non-local businessman Lee Campbell (Peter Lawford), who has an alibi for the time of the murder. Campbell tells Abel that Murphy was initially his, that the house belongs to him, and that he was letting Jenny use it after their divorce, which was the last time he saw her alive. Also, that he paid for, but did not attend, the funeral because the reason for their divorce was that she left him for another woman. He notices that Campbell is drinking Cromarty. As such, he returns to Ernie's to retrieve the bottle he took from Jenny's house. Back at Jenny's house, he knows that beneath the mess, someone was careful to remove all incriminating evidence of the murder. However, he does find something that intrigues him: a photograph, taken from the house toward the beach, of a nude man and woman running toward the surf holding hands. He can't tell the identity of either person. As she has a science background, Abel calls Kate to the house, and she is able to identify the smell in the bathtub as a disinfectant masked by deodorant, to hide the fact of where the drowning probably took place. He takes the opportunity to learn about Kate - that she is from New York where she was running away from a bad marriage. Unable to find a home for Murphy, Kate convinces Abel to take him. The two make plans for a date. After their dinner date at Abel's house, she spends the night. This date is the beginning of their relationship.Abel learns from Campbell that the woman in the photograph is not Jenny, that he does not know who either person is, and that Jenny liked to take photographs of her friends in compromising positions. Although the house used to be full of such photos, this is the only one Abel found.Abel fills Streeter in on the case at Streeter's request, although Abel tells him they don't need the help of the sheriff's office. Streeter implies that it is his business because if things go sour on the investigation, he gets the blame.As Abel heads to Jenny's house late one evening, he sees a Chevy sedan speeding away in the opposite direction on the only road leading to and from the house. Arriving at the house, he sees that it is engulfed in flames. He notices Campbell's sports car on the scene. Fighting the flames, Abel enters the house and sees a man fleeing, who manages to escape in the sports car, while Abel's car is now disabled from a slashed tire and cut cord to the police radio. He is able to telephone the fire department from the house, as the part of the house where the telephone is located is not yet touched by the fire. While in the house, he sees an unconscious body inside. He is able to get the body out, that being Campbell himself, meaning that the persons fleeing, both in the Chevy and Campbell's sports car, were not Campbell. By the time the fire department, ambulance, and police arrive, who all were delayed as the perpetrator was able to place a roadblock, the house is totally destroyed, and Campbell is dead.As Abel and Kate are in bed later that night, Murphy enters the bedroom and begins to snarl, as if he is ready to attack, which is the first time he's done such since either has known him. They are both scared, but Kate, using what she knows as his training, is eventually able to get Murphy back to a normal state. Although able to subdue him, she does not know what set him off. Because of Murphy's volatile behavior, Abel wants Kate to take Murphy back to Warren's office.Streeter and his men come storming into town, he telling Abel that he is taking over the investigation. A comment by Streeter before he leaves makes Abel wonder how Kate knew Murphy's name, as Warren's office had never treated him before. This question also makes Abel think that the woman in the photograph is Kate. Confronting Kate at her apartment, Abel manhandles her as her answers to his question about Murphy aren't as he would like. Thinking about it, Kate remembers that Warren was the one who mentioned the dog's name to her, as he was the one who got the call to pick up the dog from the beach. Later, Abel heads to Warren's office, where he clandestinely watches Warren in the pen with Murphy, training him to attack. As Abel confronts Warren, Warren tries to dismiss what he was doing a friendly play with Murphy. Abel then arrests him for the murder of Jenny, her ex-husband, and his own unborn child. The one piece of the puzzle Abel has not yet figured out is the identity of the third party, the woman in the photograph who was the third in Warren and Jenny's ménage-a-trois. Just then, a patient (Norma Connolly) arrives with her dog. Warren asks if he can attend to this emergency, which was the reason he came to the office early. Abel allows him as much. Warren gets Abel to hold onto the dog, to whom he will give an injection to reduce the swelling in the dog's prostate. Instead, Warren stabs Abel with the needle and runs off. A car chase ensues, with Abel able to radio for help. The primary question's are what was in the injection and will Abel be either conscious or alive long enough from that injection to catch Warren. Abel does catch up to Warren, but passes out before he can do anything. Warren drives off. One of Abel's officers, John (Christopher Connolly), arrives to take Abel to the hospital.When Abel awakens in the hospital, he learns from Streeter that he was injected with sodium pentobarbital, and that the dose would have killed a large dog. Based on information from John, Streeter also mentions that they have picked up Kate as the co-murderer, but Abel responds that she is not the other person they are looking for. Later that night, Abel, still in a groggy state, sneaks out of the hospital and heads to Kate's. Seeing him, Kate is concerned for him. He, in turn, is unable to say anything to her, and he walks off.Streeter and his men are unable to locate Warren, whose office is being packed up on the directive of an unknown woman. Warren's boat is also missing from the harbor. They assume he has sailed away to parts unknown. But upon questioning Streeter, Abel and John realize that what Warren has done is hide out in his own house in town, and his wife (June Allyson) was able to provide Streeter with all the right answers.The moving company makes delivery of Warren's office items to his house. Across the street, Streeter, his team, and Abel's team are on surveillance. In Warren's house, Abel appears from behind a door in the room where the delivery has just been made to confront Warren. Abel threatens to kill Warren, who states that he has killed no one. Abel is able to open the blinds as a signal to the surveillance team, before he takes Warren at gunpoint down into the kitchen, where Warren's wife is preparing lunch. As Abel and Warren are walking down the stairs, Abel is hit over the head from behind by an unknown assailant. Warren rushes out of the house, and the entire surveillance team pursues him. Streeter orders him to stop, which he doesn't. As Abel emerges onto the street, he shouts at Streeter to not shoot Warren, which Streeter does anyway. He shoots Warren dead. Abel then tells him that Warren killed no one. Mrs. Watkins then rushes out from the house to her dead husband. Abel confronts Mrs. Watkins as the murderer. Despite Abel's accusations of her and Jenny's affair, she calls Jenny a bitch, as a person whose love was not pure, in the sense that it was not solely in her direction as she wanted, but rather wanting to bring Warren in as the third, before a fourth and fifth in Jenny's pursuit of free love. The pregnancy was the last straw as a sign of how she was not truly a part of Jenny's life. She is handcuffed and taken away.As Abel is alone at the police station surveying the broken equipment received as part of the request from their latest budget, Kate arrives, announcing that she is leaving town since she is out of a job. Kate mentions that she never thought Warren a murderer, which he wasn't. He was just a man in love with his wife, who cleaned up after her messes. Abel then confesses that he thought, if only for a second, that it was Kate in the photograph. Kate departs for good, leaving Abel alone with Murphy. Abel looks out the window as Kate gets in a taxi that drives away. Abel gets on the police radio to Streeter asking for a favor: to tell him where the taxi, which will be passing by his area, is going."

That night, Charlie changes his mind about the animal when it arrives at his hut barking furiously. Mitsah, while strolling through the woods at night to meet his friend, falls through the ice of a frozen lake and the animal, a wolf/dog cross breed, raises the alarm.Mitsah is saved by his father and canine friend, but falls seriously ill with hypothermia after his plunge into the icy water.

But Charlie tells them that he must get medical attention to his son or he will die. The group, after arriving at a riverside port below the snow line, are introduced to Jason Scott (Franco Nero), a writer traveling to Dawson City in search of a story. Once they arrive in town on a riverboat steamer, they meet with Sister Evangeline (Virna Lisi) a nun who has recently arrived in Dawson City to set up a hospital mission.Jason and Kurt soon discover Dawson City is like an American Wild West frontier town that is a hotbed to business corruption and barely suppressed lawlessness. Sister Evangeline has already encountered corruption in the form of the town's alcoholic priest Father Oatley (Fernando Rey), whose interest in her money is highly suspect. Father Oatley is under the thumb of Dawson City's richest and most powerful resident, Beauty Smith (John Steiner). Smith has bought his way into overall control of the settlement, with some cash and lots of promissory notes he gives to the residents in exchange for gold.

Enraged, Oatley runs out onto the streets shouting Smith's secret to the startled townsfolk.

Steve is upset by this, but Curt feels that maybe he needs to get his feelings in order. After their discussion, Steve tells Terry that he is going to give him his 1958 Chevrolet Impala until he comes back from college. As Terry only has a little Vespa scooter, the opportunity to have a hot set of wheels makes him ecstatic.After the formalities, Steve gets into Laurie's car, and tells her that he thinks they should see other people while he is away. Laurie tries to hide the fact that this upsets her, but becomes very quiet considering the ramifications.Meanwhile, Curt and John talk about how it seems every girl that comes by is ugly or has a boyfriend. ""Where is the dazzling beauty I've been waiting for all my life?"" bemoans Curt. John's conversation turns to how the strip that they cruise on keeps shrinking, remembering when a tank full of gas was needed to complete a full circuit.It is then that the group decides to split up. John heads off cruising in his yellow deuce coupe, while Terry heads out in Steve's car. Curt decides to accompany Steve and Laurie to the ""Freshman Hop,"" a sock-hop in the school gymnasium.As Milner heads off to cruise around, he encounters a couple of his buddies also cruising down the streets, who tell him of a ""very wicked '55 Chevy looking for him,"" as well as alerting him to cops watching for speeders.Steve, Laurie and Curt have pulled up to a stop light, with a white '56 T-Bird next to them. As Curt looks, a blonde driving the vehicle smiles at him, and seems to mouth the words ""I love you,"" before taking off.

However, his words fall on deaf ears.Milner soon after encounters a Studebaker, full of girls. When he asks if any of them wants to ride with him, one of the girl's sisters volunteers. However, it is only after she gets into his car does he realize what he's gotten himself into.

Holstein gives Milner a ticket, claiming one of his taillights is out, and claims that he received reports of John speeding, but is going to let him go this time, promising that one day soon, he's going to catch him in the act. After Holstein leaves, John gives Carol the ticket to put in a pouch on the driver's side door, which already contains plenty of tickets from ""the law.""Terry meanwhile, has pulled up to a light, next to a black '55 Chevy. The driver is Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford), who shouts over to Terry that he's looking for John Milner, and to let John know that he's looking to race him. After the encounter with Falfa, Terry notices a blonde walking the streets. After saying that she resembles Connie Stevens, the girl stops to talk to Terry.

The girl, named Debbie (Candy Clark), gets in, and the two drive off.Back at the sock-hop, Steve and Laurie are chosen to lead a spotlight snowball dance, and put on smiling faces for the rest of the students.

With nothing else to do at the school, he asks if he can tag along with her and her friend Bobbie (Lynne Marie Stewart). Wendy agrees, much to the ire of her friend.Back in the gymnasium, as the music picks back up, Steve and Laurie are now dancing intimately, when a teacher named Mr Kroot (Mark Anger) tells them to ""break it up.""

Seeing a new way to impress Debbie, Terry heads off to a liquor store, leaving behind the order they placed.Curt has now come to occupy the back seat of Bobbie's VW Bug, and Wendy in the passenger seat. Seeing the white T-Bird, Curt demands they follow it, much to Bobbie's irritation. When Wendy asks Curt who this girl in the T-Bird is, Curt says he has no idea. Bobbie meanwhile, claims that she's the wife of a guy who owns a jewelry store. Curt doesn't believe it, since the girl in the T-Bird is young and beautiful.Wendy confides to Bobbie about Curt's dream to be a Presidential Aide, and to one day shake hands with President Kennedy. Curt and Wendy then playfully bicker about telling of his future ambitions, and Curt invites her into the backseat to cuddle. Wendy then confides that she thinks Curt's decision to stay in town is a good idea, saying that maybe they can attend the local college together. Just then, Kip Pullman (Ed Greenberg) pulls up next to their car. Bobbie tells Curt to 'say anything' to Kip, whom she has a crush on and would like to meet. Curt then takes her request a bit too far, and yells over to Kips that Bobbie is madly in love with him, and trembles at the sight of his rippling biceps. This causes Bobbie to pull over immediately, demanding Curt to leave her car. Curt does so, and then sees the T-Bird off a ways. He chases after it, but it soon disappears, and he is unsure where to go or what to do next.John meanwhile, has given in to Carol's request for a drink, and takes her to Burger City for a Coke. While there, John meets one of his hot rod buddies, and explains that he's babysitting Carol. Carol gets upset and throws her drink at him, before storming out of the car. John lets her go for a bit, but then feels a sense of responsibility and catches up to Carol, who gets back into his coupe.Terry meanwhile, has gotten to the liquor store, but is unsure how to get a bottle of Old Harper for Debbie. As he ponders outside the store, a wino comes up, and Terry asks him to help. The wino takes Terry's money, but instead buys wine and exits out the back door of the store. Terry goes in, and runs off a list of things for the storekeeper to give him along with the bottle of Old Harper. However, the storekeeper still asks Terry for his ID. Terry returns to the car, now without the money, and asks Debbie for more. She is at first upset, but agrees. As Terry approaches the store again, he sees another man approaching. Terry explains his situation, and the man claims he will help Terry. However, seconds later, the man rushes out, and tosses Terry the bottle of Old Harper. The man appears to have robbed the store, and the store owner soon after emerges, firing on the man with a gun! Terry hightails it back to the Impala, and quickly gets out of there with Debbie.Meanwhile, John has taken Carol to an old junkyard, and gives her a run down of the various vehicles that he's known about, usually belonging to guys he's known who have long since died in crashes or accidents. Carol claims that John told her he's never been in an accident, but he confides that he's come close a couple of times, and that so far, none has been able to beat him.Curt meanwhile, has taken to sitting on the hood of a car, watching an episode of ""Ozzie and Harriet"" through the window of an appliance store. As he notices, several guys who are part of a gang called ""The Pharoahs"" accost him, claiming he's sitting on a car that belongs to a friend of theirs. When Curt gets off, one of the members tells Curt that he appears to have left a scratch in the hood. The guys then take Curt along with them in their car, deciding on a 'fitting punishment'. As Curt feels he is going to die, the white T-Bird passes by. Shortly thereafter. Falfa's '55 Chevy passes, and the leader of the Pharoahs claims that this guy aims to beat Milner, claiming John's days are numbered.Meanwhile, John and Carol encounter a white Cadillac, full of girls. The girls claim that John's car deserves their special prize. When John is eager to accept it, the girls hurl a water balloon at him, which misses and hits Carol. John bursts into laughter, but Carol wants revenge, and John seems eager to have a little mischief. As both cars come to the next red light, John proceeds to flatten the other car's tires, and Carol sprays shaving cream all over the other car's windows, before the two jump back into John's car and drive off.Terry and Debbie have made it to the Canal, where Terry mixes up the Old Harper with some soda. Terry and Debbie attempt to get intimate, but there appear to be too many people walking around. Terry leaves the car door open and the music on, and he and Debbie go looking for a quiet place to be alone.Curt and the Pharoahs pull into a miniature golf establishment, where the Pharoahs attempt to pry open the pinball machines in the main building for gas money. They are soon caught by Mr. Gordon (Scott Beach), who is a member of the Moose Lodge in town. Curt claims that the guys he is with are his friends, and Gordon takes Curt into the back to meet with another Moose Lodge member named Hank (Al Nalbandian). They both congratulate Curt on winning the Lodge's first scholarship, before he takes leave along with the Pharoahs, who have finished cleaning out the change in the pinball machines. The leader of the Pharoahs is impressed with how Curt handled the situation, and decides that he and his friends will consider making Curt one of them.Back at the Canal, Terry stops necking with Debbie, when he realizes the music from the car has stopped. He and Debbie then return to where the car was, only to find that it has been stolen!Meanwhile, in another part of the Canal, Steve and Laurie are getting intimate in her car. The conversation shifts a little towards Steve's decision of wanting to go, and how Curt does not. The talk again upsets Laurie, and she stops giving in to Steve's advances. When he claims he wants something to remember her by, she goes limp, infuriating him more that she is just going to let him do whatever but she isn't going to take any pleasure out of it. When Steve makes an off hand comment about Laurie watching her brother 'doing something,' Laurie yells at Steve ""You're disgusting!"" and kicks him out of the car, before driving off.Terry and Debbie are walking near the canal, with Debbie explaining about reports of a person in the area dubbed ""The Goat Killer,"" who kills and dismembers his victims. Terry is getting more and more freaked out by her talking, when a noise distracts them. At first thinking it might be the goat killer, Terry is relieved when it turns out to be Steve. When Debbie explains that their car was stolen, Terry attempts to divert the subject (not wanting Steve to know that ""his"" car was stolen).Back with John and Carol, John attempts to trick Carol into telling where she lives, to try and take her home, but Carol is stubborn, claiming she isn't going home until she ""gets some action."" It is then that Bob Falfa's car pulls alongside John, and the two trade barbs, with Bob insisting on racing John. They do a small race through several lights before John stops at a red light and Bob continues on through. Carol notes that Bob is fast, but John says that while he is fast, he also seems stupid.Meanwhile, Steve separates from Terry and Debbie, and goes back to Burger City, while Terry and Debbie go off to report the car stolen.Curt and the Pharoahs have meanwhile located a police car watching for speeders. The leader of the Pharoahs charges Curt with hooking a tow cable to the rear axle of the car. Curt is unsure about this, but is told that he has to do this, or the Pharoahs will still plan to make him suffer for the vehicle he scratched. Curt has some close calls, but eventually gets the cable hooked. As he rushes back to the Pharoahs, they then speed by the officers, with Curt yelling at the top of his lungs, ""Stand by for justice!"" The cops then take off, but the cable catches, tearing the rear axle off their car. Prepared for shock and awe, the two cops turn around, speechlessly looking at the torn off rear axle of their car. Nearby, Terry and Debbie are witnesses to the incident as well.Carol soon finds herself confused when John takes her along a dark stretch of road, and John seems intent on having his way with her. Carol's spitfire demeanor wavers and she insists that much of her toughness was pretend. John explains that if he knew where she lived, he could take her home, and Carol immediately tells him her address. Of course, John was hoping that his 'trick' would work, and they head off for Carol's place.At Burger City, Steve meets up with a waitress named Budda (Jana Bellan). Budda takes a moment to talk with Steve, who explains about how he and Laurie broke up. Budda takes this opportunity to tell Steve how she secretly likes him, and offers to have him come over to her place after her shift is over. As they talk, both are unaware that Laurie has returned to Burger City as well and is outside, having stopped at seeing Budda and Steve talking in a booth. Laurie assumes the worst, and quickly leaves before they see her. Back inside the restaurant, Steve declines Budda's offer, and watches her get back to work.Outside, The Pharaohs pull up with Curt, and eagerly applaud what he has done. The Pharaohs are eager to induct Curt the next evening into their group, but Curt does not tell them that he'll be gone. Curt then gets into his car, and sees the white T-Bird pass by. He tries to start up his car, but it won't turn over, and he watches once again as the mysterious blonde slips from his grasp once more.Laurie is cruising around the strip when she encounters Bob Falfa. She parks her car and gets in with him, and they begin to cruise. Falfa attempts to talk with her, but Laurie explains she does not want to talk.John finally gets Carol to her place, and they have an awkward goodbye, until John gives her the cover to his gearshift as a memento. Carol happily takes it and goes to her house, as John drives off, a strange look on his face.Back at Burger City, Curt has run into Steve, and is shocked when Steve explains that he is now considering not going to college out East. Curt attempts to calm Steve, but also ends up fixing his car, and takes off, leaving Steve unsure of what to do now.Meanwhile, Terry has had an adverse reaction to the alcohol, and has thrown up most of it. After Terry recovers, he and Debbie walk a ways off, and find Steve's Impala parked in a lot! Terry finds the car unlocked and the keys gone. He attempts to hot-wire the car when the guys who stole it confront him, and attempt to beat him up. Debbie attempts to stop them, but they are both saved when John rolls by, comes over and scares away the two men.Back at Burger City, another classmate of Steve's tells him that Laurie was seen riding around with Bob Falfa. Just as Terry and Debbie pull up outside Burger City with his car, Steve rushes out and shoos Terry and Debbie out of his car, and drives off. Debbie is shocked that Steve just took Terry's car, and Terry tells her the truth about how the car wasn't really his, and how he just has a Vespa Scooter for transportation. Even so, Debbie smiles and tells Terry that she had a good time, and as she takes leave, tells him that she'll probably see him around.Curt meanwhile, has made his way to a radio station on the outskirts of town. Rumor is that Wolfman Jack, whose voice has played across the airwaves all evening, is located here. As Curt enters the station, he encounters a bearded man sitting in the control booth. Curt hands the man a piece of paper featuring a dedication and a request to the girl in the white T-Bird. The man explains that he can have the dedication sent into the Wolfman's main station and broadcast the next day. But Curt explains that he needs the request put out tonight, as he is unsure if he is going to be leaving town or not.The man in the control booth then explains to Curt that he really should not sell himself short, and to go out and experience life. Curt takes the words to heart, and is excited when the man tells him if he can, he'll try to get the message relayed right away. As Curt is about to exit the studio, he hears a familiar voice. He turns, and sees the man in the control booth speaking into his microphone, in the voice of Wolfman Jack. Curt smiles at having met one of his heroes, and exits the building.John is still at Burger City when Falfa comes up in his Chevy. John tells Falfa to meet him out at Paradise Road for their race. Terry pleads to go along, and John concedes.The word spreads throughout the strip, and soon reaches Steve's ears, who heads out there when word comes that Laurie is riding with Falfa.Meanwhile, Curt has returned to Burger City, and over to a nearby phone booth. On his car radio, he hears Wolfman Jack relay his dedication to the blonde in the T-Bird, and smiles as Wolfman calls Curt a good friend. Wolfman dedicates the next song to the blonde, and gives her the number of the phone booth at Burger City, encouraging the girl to call Curt.Meanwhile, John, Falfa, and a number of other kids have rolled out to Paradise Road. Once out there, John finally realizes that Laurie is riding with Falfa, and asks what she is doing in there. Laurie gives a nonchalant ""Mind your own business, John"" and stays in Falfa's car, but Terry gets out to shine his flashlight for the race. As the vehicles take off, the race stays tight, until Falfa loses control of his car, skids off the road, rolls, and crashes, whilst John continues straight down the road.Steve arrives just in time to see the aftermath, and rushes to the wreck, to see Falfa emerge and Laurie beating and hitting him. Steve pulls her off Falfa just as John pulls Falfa away from the car, just as it bursts into flames.In a moment of desperation, Laurie cries and pleads for Steve not to leave, to which Steve embraces and tells Laurie that he is not going to leave her.Terry explains to John how impressed he was with how John beat Falfa, but John confides to Terry that just before Falfa's car swerved off the road, he was beating him. Terry explains that John was just nervous, and that he'll never be beaten. John just backs up Terry's hero worship, and to calm him down, says that they'll take on all comers, as Terry yawns, muttering, ""Jesus, what a night.""Meanwhile, back at Burger City, the phone rings, and Curt answers it, ecstatic to be talking to the girl of his dreams. He inquires about her name, but she does not give it. When Curt asks to meet her, she explains that she'll be cruising the strip again that night, but Curt wants to meet her now. She then says goodbye as Curt struggles to speak more, and the line goes dead.Several hours later, Curt goes to the airport to get on the plane to head East, with his friends and family saying goodbye. Steve does not accompany him, and Curt boards the plane, taking off to a new adventure. As he glances out the window of the plane, he sees a white Thunderbird traveling along a stretch of road.As the plane banks off, the audience is treated to images of John, Terry, Steve, and Curt, along with where they ended up in life:-John Milner was killed by a drunk driver in December 1964.-Terry Fields was reported missing in action near An Loc in December 1965.-Steve Bolander is an insurance agent in Modesto, California.-Curt Henderson is a writer living in Canada."

DISTANT THUNDER. Written and directed by Satyajit Ray. India, 1972. Music: Ray. Leading players: Soumitra Chatterji, Babita.If you crossed an Italian neorealist film with a work by Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu, the result might be something like Distant Thunder. In a unique way, Indian director Satyajit Ray combines a social consciousness in a changing society with a slow narrative style to reveal nuances of character. The relaxed pace allows us to enter the world and experience the internal process and transformation of an individual. Rays films often play on the tension between traditional customs and the effects of urban modernization with a naturalness that has you wondering if his characters are real people or actors.There are few directors who give you the sense of knowing the characters as Ray does. Soumitra Chatterji as the Brahmin in Distant Thunder is gradually revealed on several levels through his relationship with his wife, students, patients and townspeople. It is the visibility of his internal dialogue and the reassessment of his values and social position amidst the so-called manmade famine of 1943 that structure the movement of the film.As the Brahmin's authority and stature in the community are rendered inconsequential by a hunger which levels all class distinctions, he is forced to give up the superiority which separates him from the peasants. With deliberate and dissecting camera movement, Ray establishes a set of polarities from the opening shots which mark the progression of Chatterji's character. His wife Babita is introduced via a hand rising above the swirling waters of a river. The course of the film literally flows in and around water, and the beginning of the famine is signaled by the cholera epidemic which prevents use of river water for drinking.Similarly, the turning point in the pundits life occurs at the waters edge. Crushed by his impotence after watching a riot at the rice mill he retreats to the shore to reconsider his position. He has been undergoing a gradual disillusionment, and comments to his wife that he doesnt understand the inability of money to buy what they need. It is Babita who proves to be more resourceful, and her embodiment of the creative force is indicated by her closeness to water. After an attempted rape she throws herself into the cleansing river. She is the one who must ultimately become the provider for the family and the link to the community.Opposed to the creative spirit expressed through the water imagery is a progression of fire symbols, signs of a burnt-out existence. The first indication of an interruption of natural forces comes in the opening moments as the townswomen, bathing, watch the flying ships overhead, harbingers of war and famine. Ray uses several closeups of insects and butterflies feeding on parched ground, but the most obvious use of fire is the badly burned body of the kiln worker. In this distorted social order he ironically becomes the supplier of grain. He is constantly seen lighting cigarettes, and smoking is a kind of social ritual throughout the film. Notice the discarded cigarette tossed in the stream as well as other instances of burning and clouding-over of life-giving water.Just as Babita's contact with the natural forces signifies a sympathy and understanding of the other sufferers, the grotesque halfburned, half-normal face of the kiln worker exaggerates his isolation and separateness from the rest of society. He has too much face. To comprehend his place in the life of the community and move closer to its creative center, the Brahmin must humble himself and undergo a loss of face. We see his metamorphosis as Ray builds silhouettes against a vast sky. The first silhouette is that of the old beggar man who asks the Brahmin for food. Later, as he realizes his false dependence on the peasants, the Brahmin undergoes his loss of face and he too appears in silhouette. Throughout the film we find small forms outlined against a large background until the final climactic and powerful image of a community joined together against a disaster manufactured by an individual act somewhere in the distance.James GreenbergSubmitted by James Spee on July 18, 2007. I first saw this film at the Seattle Film Society showing 30 years ago and I still remember it vividly."

The lethal accident threw two people through the windshields of each car, instantly killing the, but one of the people involved miracously survived. One of the police officers pulls one man out from under the car.Cut to title credits.19thC carriage and clothes. English country squire Sir Hugo Cunningham (Robert Stephens) arrives to his manor house, where his two sons -one adopted, Giles (Robert Powell), the other one being Clive (Ralph Arliss)- and one daughter, Christina (Jane Lapotaire) are already waiting for him. The three children are grown-ups now. He introduces to them his fiancée, Anna Wheatley (Fiona Walker), whom he intends to marry the following Saturday. The father also announces that he's brought with him a special camera.At the manor house library, Hugo explains to Anna that he enjoys taking photographs of dead people. He is not alone on this weird passtime, as his friend Sir Edward Barrett (Alex Scott) also enjoys so.We see a slide presentation in front of a small audience. Edward and Hugo explain that they found a dark romboidal stain in photographs of people who had just died. They think they have photographed the souls of the people who died leaving the body. Hugo tries to explain to Clive - who looks like his favourite son - that with power comes responsibility when the son comments on Hugo's generosity towards the waiting servant. He also says that death is the last change. Hugo still misses his late wife.It's March at the manor house during Hugo and Anna's visit, and it's freezing cold. He insists to record everybody soaring on a boat. First, it's Giles and Christina, then Clive and Anna. Clive's oar gets stuck in the mud, which causes him not to see a branch of a tree. A sharp pointed part of the tree stings him, who falls to the muddy river. Anna also falls to the water. Giles tries to rescue them but the water is so muddy that he can't see anything. Clive and Anna's muddy body will appear later on during the night.Two weeks later, Hugo checks on the motion picture. There appears the same black stain, so he decides to photograph the two-week old corpse of Clive.Giles is worried about Hugo's unhealthy obsession, because it causes him to disregard himself. Hugo starts thinking about the Asphyx, a spirit which appears near people who are about to die. Hugo starts looking a bit out of his mind, even asking Giles to photograph him while drinking a cup of poison.There is going to be a public hanging the following day, says Edward. Hugo wants to photograph the execution.Hugo kills a mouse so that the Asphyx appears and he can imprison it in a kind of laboratory tube with strange liquids. With a strong lamp, Giles has captured in in the halo of light. Christina appears to question what the racket was about.Later, Christina goes on her own and takes the guinea pig out. She wonders at the strange box at his father's laboratory. Hugo -with Giles at his tail as usual- goes to visit a home for the paupers. There, one of the homeless men (Terry Scully) is severely ill.Christina questions Giles about what she saw at the laboratory. Giles is worried for Hugo but can't explain it all to her because he swore to secrecy. Christina tries to console Giles even though he can't confide on her. Hugo gives the sick man home, food and shelter. The bump is so sick that he'll only live one or two days more, says the doctor. The homeless man coughs and coughs. When he is about to die, the Asphyx appears, and Hugo captures it with the strong focus light. However, in his last moments, the dying man picks up the acid which Hugo had shown Giles before, and he splashes mit all over Hugo's face. He will be left with the scar for the rest of his life. Christina has been woken up by the acute shrieks of the Asphyx, so she arrives to the laboratory to see it all. Hugo has the idea of electrocuting himself in an electric chair while Giles traps the Asphyx. Christina appears and panics, but Giles slaps her and she is the one who moves the light to trap the Asphyx inside the coffin-shaped box. Giles and Christina put the Asphyx inside of a safe box. That night, Christina is woken up by something in her bedroom: it's the guinea pig she's let loose before. She takes the mouse outside of the house and releases it just outside the door. It looks like the mouse prefers to stay inside, where he is safe and has food, water and shelter without having to survive by itself!So Hugo recovers from the electrocution. He has not died. From that moment on, Hugo behaves weirdly. He wants Anna to marry Giles -is that even possible legally?- so that they have children and the lineage goes on forever. Christina doesn't like his father's plans, but she finally obliges. Hugo wants to make them immortal, the same as him. First goes Christina. Hugo wants to trap the Asphyx when it appears to claim her. They are going to cut her head with a gillotine. But the mouse she released appears to bite off the pipe which carries the water to make the lights work. The light goes out, in the panic Hugo causes Giles to release the guillotine, and Christina dies because her head was severed off. Giles feels guilt of Christina's death. Hugo wants to die now: he wants to join his children. Giles puts the mouse inside the lamp, and doesn't allow Hugo to check it before attempting to catch the Asphynx again. Giles has thought about the way: he will be enclosed in a plastic box and then Hugo will put gas in through a pipe. When Giles is about to die and the lamp doesn't work, Hugo has time to put oxygen in. But Giles wants to die, so he takes a match out. He softly whispers ""Christina"", and lights the match. That causes an explosion. At that moment, Hugo realises that he has killed his two remaining children. Hugo is not alone though: he has as a companion... the mouse.

The volunteer fire department is called into action, disrupting a sexual tryst between David, a Vietnam veteran who works as the high school coach and volunteer fireman, and his pregnant fiancée, Judy.Judy, who works as a nurse for Dr. Brookmyre, is then summoned to the office by the doctor to help treat the traumatized Mitchell children. When she arrives, she is puzzled to find a man wearing a gas mask administering orders and tending to the children. As the firemen make their way to the Mitchell farm, they are puzzled by the sudden arrival of a platoon of soldiers.Back at the doctor's office, Major Ryder, who is in charge of the soldiers, orders some his men to don protective clothing, then gas masks, then announces that he is instituting an emergency quarantine and sealing off the town. Dr. Brookmyre, concerned about Judy's unborn baby, pulls the nurse aside to explain that a highly contagious virus has attacked the town. After inoculating Judy with an antibiotic to protect her against the virus, the doctor gives her a dose to administer to David, then urges her to slip out of the office, find David and isolate themselves from townspeople who may be carrying the disease.As the soldiers begin to occupy the town, David, worried about Judy, drives back to town, accompanied by his friend, Clank, who is also a war veteran. While Colonel Chris Peckem is dispatched to Evans City to take command of the situation, Ryder confers on the phone with Brubaker and other officials at central headquarters. Unknown to the people in Evans City, a plane carrying a biological weapon has crashed over the town days earlier, sending a deadly virus into its water supply. Knowing that the virus will cause either death or insanity, the military plans to drop a nuclear bomb on Evans City as a last resort. Dr. Watts, the head of TRIXIE, the team developing the virus, is also dispatched to Evans City. Dr. Watts asserts that the mission has not been carefully considered because a technician should have been sent into the field while the lead scientists remained at headquarters to analyze their findings. In their rush to make decisions without considering their ramifications, Brubaker and the other self-important officials order that martial law be instituted and the population be sequestered at the local high school. Soon after, soldiers in protective suits break into people's homes, pulling frightened children from their beds to deliver them to the high school.After Peckem arrives, he orders a second perimeter to be set up to prevent anyone from leaving town. When the mayor, who is also a lawyer, threatens to sue Peckem for abrogating civil liberties, Peckem orders the local police disarmed, and when one officer refuses, he is shot dead by the soldiers.As the disease slowly poisons Evans' population, one farmer resists the quarantine and fires at the soldiers, while his daughter calmly plays the piano and his wife stabs one of the soldiers with her knitting needles.Meanwhile, Clank, David and Judy have been apprehended by some soldiers and thrown into a van carrying Artie Bolman, his daughter Kathy and Clyde Winston, who is showing signs of insanity. When the van driver slams on his brakes, the prisoners escape and commandeer the vehicle. Winston, however, elects to stay behind, raving madly on the street.Upon arriving in Evans City, Dr. Watts announces to Peckem and Ryder that there is no antidote for the virus. Peckem blames the doctor for the situation and the doctor, in turn, accuses the major of blundering by forcing him into the field with no equipment.Meanwhile, Clank, Judy, David, Artie and his daughter seek refuge in an abandoned house for the night. Kathy begins to exhibit signs of dementia.As open rebellion spreads throughout the countryside, Peckem orders resistors to be shot and their bodies burned.Deciding to proceed to the Saunders farm on the outskirts of the perimeter, the fugitives witness the soldiers gunning down an entire family and setting their bodies on fire as their young son watches. When Kathy begins to giggle at the massacre, Clank suggests leaving the Bolmans behind. Just then, a surveillance helicopter flies overhead, spotting the fugitives. When the helicopter opens fire on them, Clank and David shoot it down.Waiting until the cover of nightfall, the fugitives make their way to the Saunders house, where Clank kills the guards in cold blood. Sickened by Clank's unwarranted violence, David realizes that his friend has been contaminated by the disease.By this time, Artie has also contracted the disease, and believing that Kathy is his late wife, rapes her. Witnessing this, Clank pulls Artie off Kathy, and soon after, Judy finds Artie's body hanging from a rafter above the cellar stairs. Kathy runs outside, and as she chases some sheep, soldiers appear and order to her freeze, but when she keeps advancing toward them, they shoot her.Judy, David and Clank flee into the woods surrounding the house, but when Clank becomes aware that he is losing his mind, he charges the soldiers, and after running out of bullets is shot in the head by them.In the lab, meanwhile, Watts analyzes blood samples taken from diseased victims in the hope of developing an antidote. Discovering a potential cure, Watts hurries to see Peckem without going through proper channels. Turned away by the soldiers, who mistake him for the diseased, Watts is herded into the crazed crowd sequestered at the high school. Swept down the stairs in the chaos, the doctor drops the vials of antidote and is knocked unconscious and dies.As Judy begins acting strangely, David explains to her that they must wait until nightfall to escape and conceals her behind a wall of concrete blocks while he hides in a watch tower. Soon after, several soldiers arrive, and one decides to search the watch tower. Knocking the soldier unconscious, David dons his protective suit and gas mask. When the other soldiers discover Judy, David knocks them unconscious. After David frees Judy from her brick hiding place, some townsfolk arrive and, mistaking David for one of the soldiers, fire and hit Judy. David reflexively shoots them all down, sparing just one boy, who calls out, Coach. Horrified at what he has done, David cradles Judy in his arms, who before dying, tells him she can feel the baby kicking.Soon after, Peckem reports to Brubaker that with over 1,500 people dead and the rest insane, the situation is now under control. To Peckem's dismay, Brubaker informs the exhausted, disillusioned colonel that the disease has spread to Louisville, Kentucky, and that he is being dispatched there to deal with the situation. As Peckem is about to leave, David, the only person who is immune to the disease, and whose blood could provide an antidote, is brought in by the soldiers, who refuse to administer an immunity test to him. David does not inform the soldiers of his immunity.The final scene shows a disconcerted Colonel Peckem boarding a helicopter to Louisville, leaving behind a town in chaos with no end in sight."
tt0069897,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Thriller']","In a crowded nightclub, a well-known drug pusher is enjoying an evening out with several female companions. One of his junkie henchmen approaches him and tells him that he's driving the pusher's car, and he's brought him a young woman who is willing to do
anything to get some drugs. The pusher is angry until
he sees the person in the car, a beautiful woman who
returns with him to a shabby apartment. Just when it
seems like they are going to have sex, the woman pulls
a severely sawed-off shotgun out of her macrame purse
and blasts the dealer's head off. The henchman, who
is in the other room shooting up, is confronted by the
woman, who tells him her last name is Coffin, and that
her sister is LuBelle Coffin. LuBelle is now in a
hospital, having shot up with tainted heroin, and her
mind is permanently damaged. The enraged woman forces
the man to take another hit of heroin, which kills
him.The woman is known to her friends and associates as
Coffy (Pam Grier), a nurse at a city hospital. Coffy has a romance with political hopeful Howard Brunswick (Booker Bradshaw), but she is devoted to caring for her sister. She gets news of her ""hit"" from Carter (William Elliott), a policeman friend of hers. Carter is a good cop who refuses to take payoffs from local mobster Arturo Vitroni (Allan Arbus), and as a result, Vitroni sends his henchmen to knock Carter around. Coffy happens to be in the way at the time, and both of them wind up in the hospital. Coffy is little more than shaken, but Carter is beaten unconscious and seriously injured.More angry than ever, Coffy sets out to stop the mobsters once and for all. She learns of a pusher named King George (Robert DoQui) who is supplying heroin to local dealers. George is also a well-known pimp; Coffy is vaguely familiar with George because one of his prostitutes, Priscilla (Carol Locatell), once came to Coffy's hospital after George cut her face. Coffy visits Priscilla at her home and leans on her for information about George and his business practices. Priscilla tells Coffy about Arturo Vitroni and how he is one of George's best clients. Vitroni apparently likes to treat his hookers cruelly, humiliating them and making them do degrading things for his pleasure. Priscilla balks when Coffy asks her where George keeps his stash; she is afraid that if she tells Coffy this, George will find out and kill her, so she pulls a knife on Coffy and tries to frighten her off. Instead, Coffy turns violent, shattering a wine bottle and threatening Priscilla with the jagged edge. Priscilla tells Coffy that George keeps his heroin stash in a box under his fireplace. Just then, Priscilla's tough lesbian pimp, Harriet (Dea St. Lamont), returns and fights with Coffy, who just barely escapes.With the information she got from Priscilla, Coffy sets out to infiltrate George's business. She sets up a meeting with King George and pretends to be a Jamaican hooker named Mystique. George immediately takes her into his fold, much to the chagrin of George's 'old lady', Meg (Linda Haynes). During a party at George's pad, the jealous Meg dumps a tray of cocktails in Coffy's lap. When she goes into George's bedroom to clean up, Coffy sees her opportunity and accesses his drug stash, disposing of all his heroin and replacing it with ordinary sugar. Returning to the party, she then picks a fight with Meg and winds up fending off Meg and the rest of the girls. Coffy emerges the victor when Meg cuts herself on a series of razor blades that Coffy has hidden in her afro. Arturo Vitroni witnesses the fight, and he so taken by Coffy that he requests a session with her that very night.Coffy arrives at Vitroni's house and attempts to assassinate him, but she is stopped by Omar (Sid Haig), Arturo's bodyguard. They make the mistake of believing that King George has sent Coffy to make a hit on Arturo, so they retaliate. Keeping Coffy locked up, they lure George into a limousine and then kill him by tying a rope around him and dragging him behind the vehicle.They are undecided about what to do with Coffy. One of Vitroni's goons recognizes Coffy from the night they roughed her up along with Carter; another of Virtoni's shady associates recognizes Coffy as Howard Brunswick's girlfriend. Believing her to be a hit woman, the gangsters summon Brunswick, unsure about whether he is associated with Coffy's attempted hit. Vitroni is suspicious when he realizes that Coffy and Howard do indeed know one another, but Coffy insists Howard had nothing to do with her attempt on Vitroni's life, blaming it entirely on King George. To her dismay, Howard betrays Coffy and tells Vitroni that for all he cares, they can kill her.Omar and some other goons take Coffy to a desolate area of the city with intentions of killing her and dumping the body. Along the way they inject her with some heroin they took from King George's stash--Coffy knows it's really just sugar. She distracts them with her feminine wiles and manages to stab Omar in the throat, mortally wounding him. Another goon chases Coffy out onto a busy freeway, where he is run down by a passing vehicle. The third goon, a crooked cop, tries to run Coffy down after chasing her under a bridge, but she shatters his windshield with a brick and he flips the car. Coffy steals his shotgun just before the car explodes, killing him.Coffy stashes her shotgun and hitches a ride with a stranger, luring him out of the car and stealing it once he's gone. She returns to her hiding place and retrieves the shotgun, then returns to Vitroni's and drives the car straight into the house, killing one goon who was standing on the porch. Inside she lets loose with her shotgun, killing everyone she sees until she has Vitroni cornered in a swimming pool. She toys with him and tells him she'll take a million dollar payoff to let him live, but after he tells her where Brunswick went, she shoots him anyway.Coffy's revenge isn't complete until she pays a visit to Howard. She slips into his beach house and surprises him, holding the shotgun on him. Howard is shocked to see Coffy alive, and even more shocked to hear that she's killed all of his shady associates. Howard manages to soothe Coffy, convincing her that he was only playing along with the crooks to buy time. But his speech is interrupted by a woman calling for him from upstairs; a semi-nude white woman walks out of one of the bedrooms. Coffy responds by gunning down Howard right there in his living room as the terrified woman screams in horror. Coffy then stumbles out into the morning light, grimy and covered with bloody scratches and bruises, but alive."

Afterward, amazed at how simple and satisfying the robbery felt, he confesses to his best friend, police detective Tom (Cliff Gorman).Tom later hosts a party in his suburban backyard, during which a friend who has quit the police force extols the virtues of corporate life and despairs the corruption of the police, prompting Joe to snap defensively that cops like Tom and him are principled, although they could get away with almost anything they desired.Soon after, Joe arrests a woman who stabbed her boyfriend. Upon discovering that she was acting out of fury after catching the man raping her daughter, and knowing the woman will face jail time, Joe is further demoralized.Meanwhile, Tom faces the same disheartenment as he investigates the robbery of a dismissive woman so wealthy that she will barely notice the loss of the stolen goods. One night, Tom suggests that the two abandon their principles and steal something big, worth a million dollars apiece. Over the next few weeks the two discuss possible scenarios, and Tom, the smarter of the pair, concocts a scheme to approach Mafia fence Patsy ONeill (John P. Ryan). Disguised, he visits Patsy in the mobsters home bowling alley and offers to steal anything Patsy wants for $2 million. Patsy, who trusts Tom simply because he is so brash and his idea so straightforward, asks for securities, or treasurers bonds. If Tom can steal $10 million worth, Patsy will pay twenty percent. The mobster offers a phone number and code to get in touch with him, then has Tom ushered out and instructs his men to track and identify him.Although two thugs follow Tom into the subway, Joe, in uniform, blocks off the escalator and Tom escapes. Over the following weeks, Tom researches bonds at the American Stock Exchange, then targets a particular Wall Street securities firm to rob. At the same time, Joe is involved in a street shootout in which his partner, Paul Jones, is shot in the leg. Fearful for his own life, Joe tells Tom he wants only to have enough money to move to Saskatchewan, Canada and buy a farm.Another night, Joe is again shot at and grows more frustrated when he has to protect his new, inexperienced partner. Tom studies the Wall Street firms security system, then announces to Joe that they will carry out the robbery during the upcoming parade welcoming home the astronauts of a recent space trip, at which there will be 150,000 people and hundreds of policemen.On the day of the parade, Tom and Joe, in uniform and wearing fake mustaches, stride into the building and inform the security guard that they must investigate a complaint about items being thrown out the window onto the heads of the parade-goers. Unable to get through the secure doors without an escort, they await senior partner Eastpoole, who reluctantly agrees to bring them in. Having thoroughly investigated the security cameras, Tom has deduced which corridor is out of camera range, and once there, they inform Eastpoole that he is being robbed.The executive coolly instructs his secretary, Ms. Wells, to take Tom to the vault. While a tense Joe watches Tom and Ms. Wellss progress on a monitor in Eastpooles office, the secretary fills Toms satchel with securities. Just then, however, two policemen enter and inform the security guard that a messenger has been shot in the building, necessitating a search of everyone inside. Joe aims a gun at Eastpoole and instructs him to allow the search everywhere but his own office. As Tom travels the hallways, he is forced to hide each time a policeman appears, and as a result his return to Eastpooles office is so slow that Joe, panicked, is about to shoot the executive. Tom finally appears, however, and after handcuffing Ms. Wells and Eastpoole together, quickly resolves to shred the bonds in order to avoid being searched and arrested by the police. Although Joe is at first horrified, Tom explains that they are stealing headlines, not bonds, needing only for ONeill to believe they stole the bonds. Happily, Joe joins Tom in throwing the shreds out the window, where it mingles with the parades confetti.Soon after, Tom hears on the radio that Eastpoole declared they stole $12 million, and realizes that the executive took the other $2 million for himself. Meanwhile, Patsy hears about the robbery and approaches his superior, Mr. Joe, for a loan, explaining that he plans to kill Tom and Joe. Tom is initially afraid to call Patsy, but Joe counsels him that they must go forward, despite the risks.They arrange for the money to be dropped off in Central Park, and upon meeting Patsy's thugs there, count at least ten men. Tom insists on checking out the baskets of money brought by the thugs, and although the first contains false bundles of cash, the second contains the full amount. Returning to the police car manned by Joe, Tom and Joe consult nervously, while outside the park Patsy continues to try, and fail, to confirm Toms and Joes true identities.Meanwhile, the police arrive and block off the park exits. Tom calls the lead thug Marty (Joe Spinell) with the basket of money into the car to make the switch, and as soon as the man sits, Joe drives off. Followed by the thugs, Joe careens through the park, slowed by the roadblocks and a group of irate bicyclists hired by Patsy. At one point, the thug jumps out and Tom and Joe seem trapped, until Joe drives through a barrier into a police parking lot, effectively stymieing everyone in pursuit. By the time the police realize what has happened, Joe and Tom have hopped onto a cross-town bus, where they ride for free after flashing their badges. Later, while Patsy is killed by Mr. Joe, Tom and Joe, having decided to lay low for one year, spend the rest of the summer floating in the pool, dreaming of the day they can break free."

She leaves behind an unsettled Stefano.The next day, Dani watches Carol being taken away by two bikers. They gloved killer is driving around, passing Dani who looks right at the driver. At a hippy party, Carol is kissing the two men and smoking dope, but when one of them tries to further the interaction, she puts her joint out on his chest. Carol leaves and ends up in a marshy area. She sees the masked killer standing a short distance away in the fog and runs away, but the killer catches up with her and knocks her down to the ground. Carol is strangled with a scarf and her head is pushed underwater. When Carol is dead, the killer gets a knife and cuts into Carol's eyes.The next day, the police show the students of the art class the scarf that connects the two recent murders. Dani tells Jane that the two bikers who took Carol and that they had no scarfs. At her house, Dani gets a phone call in which the killer threatens her about her scarf knowledge. Dani's uncle comes home (Jane had seen the man earlier talking to Carol) and suggests that Dani go to the country house in Perugia for a few days to hide out and relax.Meanwhile, Inspector Martino interviews a vender and ask him if he remembers selling a scarf. The man denies any recollection, but after the inspector leaves, the vender gets on a pay phone can tells someone that he wants money to keep quiet about a transaction concerning the scarf in question. A little later, Stefano talks to Dani saying that she ""belongs"" to him. Dani remembers Stefano wearing the scarf. She gets away from Stefano, calls Jane and asks her to come over.After Dani tells Jane about Stefano, his scarf and the threatening phone call, Jane says she will be coming to the country house a little later then the rest of them. That evening, the ""scarf seller"" is walking at night with a healthy chunk of cash when he is chased down by a car and crushed against a wall. The killer then takes the cash that he had apparently given the vendor earlier.The next morning, Jane goes to see Stefano and after she lets herself into his house, she sees a doll (recalling the doll flashing in the killer's mind during the murders). A neighbor woman tells Jane that Stefano was not home last night and that he might be out of town.Meanwhile, Dani and her two friends, lesbian couple Ursula and Katia, are traveling by train to Perugia. A friendly doctor named Roberto (having occasionally been seen around the university in Rome) enters their compartment and sits by Dani. The three of them arrive in Perugia and draw some attention with their revealing modern clothing as they purchase goods at a local grocery store for the week they are at a villa over looking the town. That night, Jane arrives outside Perugia in her car at an Esso gas station to ask for directions to the villa and for her car to be worked on. The mechanic says that he cannot work on the car until tomorrow for the garage is closing for the night, so he gives Jane a ride in his car up to the house on the hill. At the house, Jane tells Dani that Stefano probably did not commit any murder. Dani remembers Stefano's scarf design was slightly different for the scarf he was wearing had red stripes on a black background, not the black stripes on a red background as described by the police, but she knows that she saw a man driving a car earlier wearing the scarf but cannot remember who it was.A weird guy from the village arrives at the villa and watches through a window as Ursula and Katia lie on a bed and making out with each other. The weirdo sees the killer with his knife, so he runs and hides, but the unseen killer finds him and finishes him off.The next day, a man comes to deliver some groceries. When Jane runs down the stairs to greet him, she slips and twists her ankle. Roberto visits the house to check on Jane's ankle and Dani remembers him from the train. With Jane disabled, the three other women walk to a spring behind the villa to skinny dip. While swimming, Dani think she sees Stefano and calls out to him, but Ursula and Katia do not see anyone. That evening, the women say goodnight to the bedridden Jane. Downstairs, Dani decides to call Stefano and discovers that the phone is dead. The door buzzes and Stefano is standing in the doorway with his scarf, but he drops dead to reveal the masked killer behind him (clutching onto Stefano's scarf). Dani and the other two women scream.The next morning, Jane awakes up, limps to the door and calls out to her friends. She slowly walks down the stairs and screams when she sees Ursula and Katia dead in the living room, having been stabbed multiple times. Dani appears and reaches out to Jane, but she falls to the floor also from being stabbed and left for dead, but she dies before she can tell Jane anything. When she sees the front door being unlocked, Jane hides. The unseen black-clad killer enters the living room and begins sawing Ursula's corpse with a saw as Jane cringes in her hiding spot behind a door from the sight and sounds of it. Just then, the delivery man arrives with his groceries and leaves when no one answers to his knocking on the front door. After the man leaves, the killer resumes sawing up Ursula, puts her disembodied remains in a plastic bag and walks out. Jane comes out of her hiding place and heads for the stairs, and freezes when the door is opened again but the killer is only throwing in the bread and milk delivery left behind. Finding the telephone dead and the front door locked, Jane goes upstairs, despite the intense pain from her sprained ankle, resting at the top and not realizing that her slippers have come off.Jane goes to her bedroom window and sees the town below. She tries to signal someone using her cosmetics mirror reflecting sunlight. Roberto, still in town, looks up at the house and sees the reflection of the sunlight. He checks a phone directory at a local payphone and calls, but receives no answer. Jane, seeing the killer coming back, quickly cleans up the bedroom and hides all her clothes and other stuff to give the appearance of no one being there. She sees that her slippers are gone and looks out the bedroom door and sees the killer sawing up the dead body of Katia. Just then, the gas station owner arrives with Jane's car and knocks on the front door. With the killer again freezing and Jane unable to make a sound out of fear of being discovered, the gas station man leaves. As Jane goes to the window to try to signal a warning, she knocks over a chair. The killer comes upstairs forcing Jane to hide behind a drawer. After looking around the room and finding no one or any belongings, the killer then locks the bedroom door, with Jane still inside and leaves the key in the door. The killer then finds Jane's slippers on the steps, but he instinctively picks them up and throws them onto a bathroom floor. Jane is now locked in her own room while the killer goes back downstairs to resume sawing up Katia and Dani's dead bodies and leaves with them to bury them in a field a short distance away. When he is finished with burying the bodies of Stefano, Ursula, Katia and Dani, the killer then cleans up the house, washing away the blood and leaves while Jane watches, but she is still locked in her bedroom.At night, the grocery man tries to convince a group of local men that there are four women at the house as opposed to three the men had seen arrive. The killer is nearby and overhears the men. At the same time, Roberto goes to the gas station to get fuel before driving away and sees Jane's car there. The gas station manager tells him that although no one answered the door when he went to drop off Jane's car earlier, he also says that he did not see any of the other women leave.Back at the house, Jane, still locked in her bedroom, slides a newspaper under the door and pushes the key through the keyhole. The key misses the paper, but the killer graciously places the key on the paper for her. When Jane retrieves the key and finally gets the door open, Franz grabs her. Both of them are surprised to see each other and Franz tells Jane that ""he had to do it"", and that the women ""were only dolls"". A flashback shows a young Franz with his brother and a girl, and his brother, wishing to see the girl in an intimate ways, goes for her doll at the edge of a cliff and falls to his death. This made Franz see women who bring nothing but bad things for men. Franz also tells Jane that Flo and Carol seduced him and blackmailed him (they were the three people in the beginning), and they he had to kill Dani because she would have eventually remembered him and his scarf. Franz says he never wanted to hurt Jane, but since she knows that he is the killer, he must kill her to keep his secret intact. Just as Franz begins to strangle Jane with the red and black scarf, Roberto arrives and he and the crazed professor struggle which leads out the front door and into a barn. The struggle leads to the edge of a cliff that the barn sits right beside. Jane stumbles outside and hears someone fall. She watches warily as Roberto returns to her claiming that Franz is dead and the two of them leave to get the police."

""Dark Star"" is the spaceship.Talby (Dre Pahich, with the voice of John Carpenter) is one of the astronauts, and he falls asleep. The crew can speak to Bomb 19 (Alan Sheretz's voice), which destroys a planet. Dark Star goes to hyperspace and leaves the hell out of there, watching the explosion from far away. The computer (Cookie Knapp's voice) says that they've destroyed the last unstable planet on that system. However, the computer finds another unstable red-dwarf planet, so they have to go and check it out.Francis Boiler (Cal Kuniholm) puts on some country music on the radio. On the ship's log, we can hear that a part of the ship self-distructed. They are dancing to the sound of funky music. The computer tells about something on collision course, and the defence system was destroyed some time ago, so they try to do something manually. A thunder activates a bomb. Bomb 20 (Adam Beckenbaugh) is deployed, but luckily, the computer overides the orders and Bomb 20 finally goes back to its place. Images of a hole around the destroyed laser machine.Lt. Doolittle (Brian Narelle), Sgt. Pinback (Dan O'Bannon) and Talby go to their room. They sleep in the same place, and it looks like an aparment from the projects in the 60's. One of them makes music with empty bottles of liquor.Talby should be watching the ship, but he's always sleeping. He is advised to see the rest of the ship. He says that space can be wonderful and full of colour, and Doolittle says that he misses Earth and Mars as well. Francis Boiler starts shooting a square of metal just to distract himself, although Pinback tells him not to do it. The computer tells Pinback about the alien going awry, telling him that it was his original idea to bring him into the ship.The alien (Nick Castle) is a beach ball with legs. It doesn't want to eat. Pinback brought it in because he thought it was fine. Pinback is cleaning up the alien's mess when it attacks him. The alien leaves the room. Pinback gives it a plastic toy, and it eats it, but when Pinback goes to pick the broom, the alien is not there. It holds the broom and hits Pinback with it. Pinback looks for the alien in the bowels of the ship. Pinback uses a plank to go to the alien. A sign says ""Emergency air lock interior room"". The alien goes around Pinback and takes the plank away. He tries to cross the shaft, although the corridor is very narrow. It is the lift shaft, and the computer says that it's been activated. Pinback tries to move on towards the alien, but it attacks him. He falls down, but can hold onto the thin layer of passway. The alien jump and tickles Pinback. The lift seems to stop when Pinback interrupts it. The lift goes up again, with Pinback holding onto an outer metalic handle. The alien turns onthe laser, which makes all the systems go crazy.Meanwhile, Doolittle and Talby have kept on talking. Bomb 20 has received a signal to ignate itself again. The computer tries to reason with it, saying that it was an error again. Bomb 20 finally agrees, but it says that that was going to be the last time.The lift stops at the third floor, and Pinback thinks of jumping out. He unscrews a floor trap and gets onto the lift. He gets stuck. He tries to use the phone for help, but it's out of order. He presses another button, and opera music resounds. The lift keeps going up and down for no apparent reason. He presses another button to clean the lift, and presses 1, which will make the lift clean itself.Finally Pinback leaves the lift amid a mist of smoke and with a metalic lid around his waist. Now, at this moment, he's really pissed off, so he goes to pick and anesthetic gun. Soon enough, he finds the alien, cornered somewhere. He shoots the alien, who flies all over the place, and ends up deinflated.Pinback talks about his ordeal to the rest of the crew. They have lunch togethertalking about Talby being mentally unstable. Talby goes to the computer room, and says to Doolittle that the computer has found the malfunction in the ship.Powell left a message, saying that he doesn't intend to come back to Earth. Pinback checks his past diary logs, stating that nobody recognises his good qualities, and that nobody said ""happy birthday"" to him. The computer has finally found the malfunction: it's the laser. However, everybody is sound sleeping but for Pinback.Eventually, they find the unstable planet. Bomb 20 is deployed. Pinback is in the emergency air lock, where there is a door which can be opened without depressureization. There, there is the laser who works badly. Nobody wants to hear Pinback, because they are busy with the deployment of Bomb 20. The laser is turned on, and it shoots inside the ship. The laser makes Pinback blind, and he crosses the path of the laserbeams. This creates further malfunctions, so they can't drop the bomb. Everybody panics on the bridge because the explosion sequence goes on, and Bomb 20 refuses to turn itself off.The computer will only contain the damage done to the ship by Bomb 20 up to a certain degree. They have to ask Powell, in the cryogenic deep-freeze compartment, what could be done. Powell asks about the Dodgers, and complains that he's lonely. When he is about to give a suggestion, the mike has a malfunction, and then Powells forgets about it. Pinback tries to reason with Bomb 20 while Doolittle questions Powell. Doolittle goes out to space and talks to Bomb 20.DOOLITTLE: How do you know that you exist.BOMB 20: Intuition.DOOLITTLE: You can't base everything on intuition.BOMB 20: I think, therefore I am.and the dialogue goes on and on like that. Bomb 20 agrees that its experience of the outer world depends on possibly wrong information. It says that it'd be nice to keep on discussing the matter with Doolittle, but that it has no time, because it will go off in 49 seconds. Meanwhle, Boiler tries to shoot the bomb. In the fight with Pinback, he almost shoots him.Doolittle tells Bomb 20 to consider what his purpose in life is. To explode, of course, says Bomb 20. As it can only explode once, it wouldn't like to explode at the wrong time, would it? Of course not, says Bomb 20, but as it had admitted before that it had no proof that the outer world does exist. 9 seconds, says Bomb 20, and my memory is very good. It has no proof that the orders are either wrong or correct. Bomb 20 goes back inside Dark Space to think futher about the matter.Doolittle tries to rescue Tanby, who was shot out of Dark Space. Now, Bomb 20 thinks that no order coming from the outer world can be reliable, so it explodes itself happily although Pinback tries to reason with it.

President Charles de Gaulle had granted the country of Algeria independence, a decision that has enraged many French citizens. Many of them, mostly fanatics and extremists from the army, have formed an underground organization called the Organisation de l'armée secrète, and one faction, headed by Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiery, decide to assassinate de Gaulle. They set up shop along a road that de Gaulle's motorcade will be taking to the airport, and, as the motorcade passes, open fire on the Presidential car with automatic rifles. A number of bullets shatter and enter the vehicle, but not a single of them make a mark on de Gaulle or anyone else inside. Six months later, Bastien-Thiery and the other conspirators in the plot are captured. Bastien-Thiery's lawyer makes a stay of execution, but it is turned down, and the next morning, Bastien-Thiery is executed by firing squad.The top members of the OAS, Colonel Marc Rodin, manager Casson and treasurer Montclair take stock from hiding at a remote chalet in Austria, and realize that they cannot make any move as they will constantly be watched and identified: the OAS is planted with snitches who will watch every members move, and each member has had their complete details archived. Rodin realizes that what they need is a foreigner, someone whom no one in France has seen and has no record.Three months later, Rodin has succeeded in finding the right individual, an Englishman with a short but impeccable record. He invites him to Vienna for an interview by the three OAS leaders. The Englishman is smart, enigmatic and cold-blooded; he figures out their need for an outsider to assassinate de Gaulle, given the failed prior attempts and the OAS being riddled with informants. He accepts the job, but warns that he'll have to be paid $500,000 for the work, as anyone who does something like this will never be able to work again. He demands utmost secrecy and anonymity, and asks that no one but the four of them know of this project and that he work completely by himself. He takes the codename ""the Jackal"", and takes his leave of the OAS heads; his farewell is observed by Rodins bodyguard and adjutant Victor Wolenski.The Jackal begins his preparations: he researches extensively on his target, he acquires two false passports, he pays a visit to Paris to acquire a good shooting location, and he contacts two individuals in Belgium. The first is an armorer whom he commissions to build a special rifle; the second is a forger from whom he requires special French documents.Later on, the Jackal receives an OAS contact named Valmy that will inform him of any developments regarding the President. Around the same time, the OAS sends a female agent named Denise to bed a high-ranking French politician. Two weeks after visiting the armorer and forger, he returns to acquire his purchases. He is satisfied with the gun the armorer has made, and a trial of the rifle goes well; the forger on the other hand tries to blackmail him over his papers, and the Jackal snaps his neck.All his plans complete, he leaves for France under the name of Paul Oliver Duggan.Meanwhile, to raise money to pay the Jackal, the OAS heads order their network to rob a bunch of banks across Paris. The tactics range from late night burglaries to daylight ambushes of armored cars. This sudden crime wave is noticed by the French Action Service (the French espionage branch), and although several of the robbers are captured, they are hired thugs who only know that they've been ordered to carry out these robberies on behalf of the OAS.The Action Service's suspicions grow when they learn that Rodin and his associates have suddenly secluded themselves in the Hotel Garibaldi, in Rome, which is owned by an OAS sympathizer. From research by surveillance teams in the area, they observe that Rodin and co. are untouchable. They live alone on the top floor of the hotel, and the floor below that is occupied by their eight bodyguards, highlighting the mens' fear of being kidnapped. So far, their only form of contact with the outside world is Wolenski, who makes twice-daily trips to the post office to send and receive letters. After five weeks, the Action Service decide they need Wolenski taken in for questioning. They abduct him off the street while he's walking to the post office to pick up mail, load him into the back of a truck and drive him to an airfield, where he's then flown to Paris in a small propeller plane. They interrogate and torture him to death, but all they get is that a blond killer named Jackal visited his superiors. This is enough for the chief of the Action Service to conclude that the OAS are employing an outside contract killer as part of a plot to assassinate De Gaulle.The French Interior Minister asks for an interview with De Gaulle, but his demand for secrecy is rebuffed; de Gaulle is a proud man who refuses to go into hiding or shield himself. The Interior Minister instead convenes a secret council to deal with the Jackal, which includes high-ranking individuals like Police Commissioner Berthier and Colonel St-Clair. Berthier states that because of the Jackal's anonymity from even his own employers, no one has a clue where to start looking for him; the key to finding and stopping the Jackal thus is to establish his identity. He recommends his own deputy commissioner, Claude Lebel, as the best detective in France and ideal for the job of uncovering the Jackal.Lebel, a mild-mannered but tenacious policeman, is summoned to the council. He is given access to every resource available, but he is asked to keep things secret, and that he succeeds. Lebel brings in his assistant Caron to help him out, and the two get to work contacting the heads of police agencies abroad. Meanwhile, St-Clair arrives home and pours out everything about the situation to his mistress, Denise. She later slips off and phones Valmy...Over in London, enquiries are being headed by Inspector Thomas, who has been given express authority by the Prime Minister to make full investigations regarding the Jackal (ensuring that he not be English, or if he is to be stopped). The British police come up with two things that they pass over to Lebel. Firstly, that there was a suspicious character named Charles Calthrop who was in the Dominican Republic around the time its dictator Trujillo was assassinated (Jackal in French is ""chacal"", the word formed from the first three letters of each name); a search on Calthrop's home reveals he is absent. Second and more worryingly, a review of all passport applications reveals that one was made for one Paul Oliver Duggan, who had died at the age of two.Meanwhile, the Jackal learns from Valmy that his assignment is blown, but decides to continue on regardless. He makes it to a hotel at Grasse, where he spends the night charming and seducing a fellow guest, Baroness Collette de Montpellier.The next morning the hotel records are taken and scanned, as is French customs (and more urgently than usual). Presently Duggan's name is spotted and immediately Lebel orders forces on the hotel and he heads over there himself. They find no sign of the Jackal, him having already left the hotel (something Lebel finds strange), but they learn that the Baroness's bed had been slept in by two people. Lebel interviews the Baroness, but she denies knowing a thing about the man.The Jackal's quick getaway before the police arrive is cut short by accidentally crashing his car. He decides to head for the Baroness's estate, where she takes him in. That night she tells him the police were looking for him, but promises she wont say anything if he tells her what hes about; in response, he strangles her. He takes on a new disguise and identity of bespectacled Danish pastor Per Lundqvist, whose passport he stole earlier in Heathrow Airport, and quickly but quietly leaves. He heads to Tulle station in the Baroness's car and catches a train to Paris. Hours later, the servants discover the Baroness's body.Lebel reports the failure of catching the Jackal and the murder of Madame de Montpellier, and notes that he could not have escaped unless he had been forewarned and that he now has the identity of a Danish pastor (having traced the car to the station and questioned the station authorities). He also notes that the murder means he can do away with secrecy and initiate a public manhunt. A police squad heads to Paris station to intercept the Jackal, but they arrive a few minutes too late. Lebel sends police to check every hotel in Paris, but the Jackal evades them by entering a Turkish bathhouse and being picked up by a French homosexual.Lebel uses a phone tap to discern that Denise is the OAS spy that's been tipping off the Jackal. He presents a recording of her phone call to the council, and St-Clair leaves (he later overdoses on sleeping pills); he'd tapped all the phones of the council members, having had suspicions about the Jackal being forewarned. Afterwards, he works out that the Jackal will strike in two days, or August 25, 1963 which is Liberation Day, the anniversary of France's liberation from Nazi Germany. De Gaulle, as a World War II veteran, is sure to make a public appearance on that day no matter what the threat, and the council disbands, intending to make all attempts to find the Jackal before then.Meanwhile, the Jackal kills the homosexual when he sees a public broadcast about Per Lundqvist being wanted for murder.In the early hours of Liberation Day, the Minister wearily informs Lebel that they've been unable to find the Jackal. All they can do is implement the utmost security precautions around. The day goes on, but nothing happens. Some time later, a gendarme allows the Jackal, disguised as an old one-legged French war veteran, to head to his residential address, after seeing his papers; the Jackal enters his location, sheds his disguise and disassembles his crutch to form his rifle, and waits for the President to present medals to former French Resistance members.Lebel strolls around looking for anything the least suspicious or out of place, but he doesn't find anything until he meets the gendarme around the time the President presents medals. He learns that the officer let a cripple with a crutch through, sees that the address pointed out has a window open on the top floor, and rushes over there, ordering the officer to follow him.The Jackal aims, takes his shot... and misses because De Gaulle suddenly bends his head to kiss a Resistance soldier on the cheeks, as is French custom. The Jackal reloads his gun for a second shot, but then Lebel and the gendarme burst in on him. He guns down the gendarme, but Lebel snatches up the officers submachine gun and empties it into the Jackal.Over in London, Charles Calthrop appears at his flat. The British authorities take him in for questioning, but conclude that he had nothing at all to do with the Jackal and close the matter (also forswearing any responsibility regarding the Jackal, since he was an Englishman but also a Dane and a Frenchman). Thomas ponders who the Jackal really was...The film ends with a funeral in Paris: a body is buried in an unmarked grave, with Lebel the only witness."

Laura encounters two elderly sisters, Heather (Hilary Mason) and Wendy (Clelia Matania), at a restaurant where she and John are dining; Heather claims to be psychic and despite being blind informs Laura she is able to 'see' the Baxters' deceased daughter. Shaken, Laura returns to her table, where she faints.Laura is taken to the hospital, where she later tells John what Heather told her. John is skeptical but pleasantly surprised by the positive change in Laura's demeanour. Later in the evening after returning from the hospital, John and Laura engage in passionate sex. Afterwards, they go out to dinner where they get lost and briefly become separated. John catches a glimpse of what looks like a small child (Adelina Poerio) wearing a red coat similar to the one Christine was wearing when she died.The next day, Laura meets with Heather and Wendy at their apartment who hold a séance to try to contact Christine. When she returns to the hotel, Laura informs John that Christine has said he is in danger and must leave Venice. John loses his temper with Laura, but that night they receive a telephone call informing them that their son (Nicholas Salter) has been injured in an accident at his boarding school. Laura departs for England, while John stays on to complete the restoration.Under the assumption that Laura is in England, John is shocked when later that day he spots her on a barge that is part of a funeral cortege, accompanied by the two sisters. Concerned about his wife's mental state and with reports of a serial killer at large in Venice, he reports Laura's disappearance to the police. The inspector (Renato Scarpa) investigating the killings is suspicious of John and has him followed.After conducting a futile search for Laura and the sisters in which he again sees the childlike figure in the red coat, John contacts his son's boarding school to enquire about his condition, only to discover Laura is already at the school. After speaking to her to confirm she really is in England, a bewildered John returns to the police station to inform the police he has found his wife. In the meantime the police have brought Heather in for questioning, so an apologetic John offers to escort her back to the hotel.Shortly after returning, John catches another glimpse of the mysterious figure in red as he is leaving Heather's hotel, and this time pursues it. Meanwhile, Heather has slipped into a trance and upon coming out of it beseeches her sister to go after John, sensing that something terrible is about to happen, but Wendy is unable to catch up with him. John follows the elusive figure to a deserted palazzo, and having cornered it, realizes (way too late) that the strange sightings he has been experiencing were premonitions of his own death. The ""child"" in the red raincoat that John has been seeing is NOT the ghost of Christine, but is actually a killer dwarf whom is responsible for all of the murders happening in Venice, and the dwarf kills him by stabbing him in the neck with a butcher knife. As the killer escapes, John sees his whole life flash before his eyes for several seconds as he dies. Laura, Heather, and the police arrive on the sceen too late to save John or to aprehend the killer dwarf whom has claimed John as her latest victim.The final shots of the movie show Laura along with her son, and the two sisters on a funeral barge traveling to a local church for John's funeral... just as he visioned it on the day before his own murder."
tt0070022,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","The tension between a lonely policemen and the journeymen of the counter culture provides the subtext, and the stunning martian look of the Arizona mesa the backdrop, of a brilliant and influential debut feature by musician James William Guercio; the film is the missing link between The Searchers and No Country for Old Men. John Wintergreen is a diminutive motorcycle cop working the lonely highways of Arizona in the mid seventies. He works alone, but occasionally hooks up with his pal ""Zipper"". Wintergreen is conscientious and friendly, whereas Zipper is bored and argumentative, often holing up off the highway to read comic books rather than out on the road . Wintergreen is a native american and has ambitions to be a detective. So when Zipper and Wintergreen find a delerious and disoriented elderly man wandering in the desert, the trail of how he got there leads back to a deserted shack. Inside is the body of a man who has committed suicide with a shotgun. Wintergreen airs his suspicions about the death, first to the coroner who is keen not to get involved, and then to Harve Poole, an Arizona detective. Harve believes John Wintergreen's suspicions are right and takes him under his wing as his driver and protege. This seems like the break Wintergreen needs to leave the big Harley police bike behind and to walk tall as a detective, in fresh duds, boots and a stetson, dispensing wisdom. But tensions between the two mount over cocktail waitress Jolene ,and in differences of opinion over the murder, especially over some missing money, some hidden drugs and the suspected involvement of outlaw hippy bikers, whom Harve is keen to bust. Wintergreens own run-ins with the hippies on their way to and from California were mostly friendly. Some of his colleagues in the Highway Patrol, however, believe they are in a running battle with disrespectful, drug running, proto-terrorists. John is caught in the nexus of his loyalty to the police force, his ambitions to be detective, his companions distrust of the hippies, Harve's domioneering style, Zippers recidivism, Jolenes manipulation, his sense of responsibility and his own easygoing natural empathy with the people he meets.

tt0070030,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","Driven to desperation by the economic depression of 1930s America, a subculture of hobos hopped freight trains to get from place to place in search of jobs, handouts, or even to take it easy sometimes. Emperor of the North Pole depicts a microcosm of this subculture set in Oregon, and actually used the Oregon, Pacific & Eastern railroad which was taken up in 1994 like so much other trackage around the country. Thus, this motion picture serves as not only a look into an important aspect of American history, but into a specific piece of it in the Pacific Northwest.The film opens with the mechanical star, 2-8-2 steam locomotive #19, stopping to take on water while a hobo who calls himself ""A-#1"" looks on in anticipation of hopping this local train. Meanwhile, the conductor, ""Shack"", makes his presence known to the other hobos hiding in the weeds with a menacing countenance. As they pull back onto the mainline, Shack spies an ambitious hobo hopping between cars and quickly makes him pay his fare by knocking him down between the rails to his death. This sets the tone for the movie. The single-minded, almost hateful Shack bound and determined to prevent anyone from riding his train versus the veteran hobo A-#1 bound and determined to ride the 19 train. Each has his reputation at stake.A-#1 manages to hop aboard and hide in a cattle car undetected, but a greenhorn punk who calls himself ""Cigaret"" gives him away as he, too, climbs into the same car. Shack sees the kid closing the hatch and locks them in, leading to an unexpected turn of events.A-#1 sets fire to the hay in the car in order to burn his way through the wooden slats. He succeeds and hurls himself off the car to make his getaway as the train pulls into the yard with smoke billowing up. The kid, Cigaret, follows him with glee, but his celebration is short-lived as the yard workers haul him into the shop for a good grilling.The kid spins a yarn as if he were the veteran hobo whose plans were bolloxed up by A-#1, but the yard workers believe him and set up a sure-thing bet designed to net some easy money from Shack's brakeman, Cracker. Right at payoff time, Shack stops their little game and learns that somebody is fixin to ride his train.Spurred into defending his reputation in this micro-society, A-#1 makes it known in the hobo community that he intends to ride the 19 to Portland, a feat which is unbelievable to all. They all declare, ""Nobody rides Shack's train!""On heightened alert now, Shack blasts his train out of the yard at high speed (highballing) to prevent anyone from hopping on and runs the train into the first trap set for him by A-#1: a switch thrown reverse into a short spur track. Since the railroad operated on train orders which depended on trains leaving and arriving at agreed-upon times, this put the 19 into jeopardy of not making it to the siding (the ""Junction"") before the Fast Mail train came blasting the opposite direction.Once they backed the train onto the mainline and got underway, A-#1 uncouples the cars from the tender, introducing yet another delay. Shack's frustration and genuine concern for the destruction and loss of life that would occur should the 19 not make it to the siding in time are evident as he pleads with the ""bo"" to stop interfering. Underneath it all we know that Shack is also vengeful, and he shall have his day shortly.As the Fast Mail train bears down on the switch, the 19 just barely makes it into the siding and clears the mainline with inches to spare, a fact not lost on the brakeman who would have become quite flattened otherwise. A-#1 is suitably impressed that the Fast Mail train was not a ""ghost story"" as he had thought.Unable to shake the pesky Cigaret, A-#1 reluctantly takes him under his wing to show him how to be a ""meat eater"" and make his way in life despite its hardships and the corruption of authority figures. We see a number of tricks of the hobo trade and hear a lot of the slang used by hobos, another slice of history capsulized. A few scenes bring a chuckle or two.*** SPOILER ALERT ***Ultimately, Shack meets A-#1 in a bloody, gruesome fight with chains, 2x4 boards, and even an axe. We can see the determination and agony of each of them as they intentionally draw out the brawl. While Cigaret looks on, Shack gets his comeuppance as A-#1 shoves him off the train. Yet, we hear Shack shouting ""You aint seen the last of me!""The cocky punk Cigaret boasts about ""their"" accomplishments, which drives A-#1 to decide that enough is enough, so the kid gets the heave-ho into the river, too. A-#1 dishes out a lengthy sermon to him as the train rounds the bend and into history."
tt0070034,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","In Hong Kong, a Mr Braithwaite attends a sparring match of martial artists. Among them is a man named Lee who fights an opponent considerably larger than him. Lee himself is exceptionally skilled, forcing his opponent (Sammo Kam-Bo Hung) to yield. At the end of the match, several of the monks present raise their hands creating an obstacle that Mr Lee flips himself over easily, earning their applause.
Braithwaite meets later with Lee. Before Lee talks to Braithwaite, he gives a short lesson in harmony and control to a young male student of his, teaching the boy not to attack with anger or exposition. Lee also teaches the boy how to bow properly to earn the respect of an opponent. Braithwaite reveals his purpose for the meeting: Lee has received an invitation to a large martial arts tournament on a private island run by a reclusive man named Han. Han is suspected of doing business in prostitution and heroin, however no solid evidence can be found linking Han to any nefarious dealings. Braithwaite wants Lee to attend the tournament and act as a spy. Lee is slightly reluctant, having not wanted to attend the tournament, however he agrees.Before Lee leaves for Han's island, he visits the Old Man of his Shaolin temple, who tells Lee about the day his sister was killed. Many of Han's thugs had come to the mainland and had attacked Su Lin. Though she skillfully and bravely fought them off, she was cornered in an old warehouse. Rather than be beaten and raped, she killed herself with a shard of glass. One of the men who led the attack, Oharra, Han's right-hand man, witnesses her suicide. The Old Man bids Lee to obtain revenge not only for his sister but for the honor of Shaolin.Around the time that Lee is ready to board Han's sampan, two other men arrive. Roper, a fancy playboy of sorts, who totes a lot of baggage, has come to the Orient to hide out from the mob, to whom he owes money. In his last meeting with some mob thugs, Roper fought his way out of having his leg broken to repay his debt. The second man is Williams, a black man who was harassed and attacked by the police right after meeting with his sensei in the United States. When he was a attacked, Williams fought back, besting the two cops and escaping in their cruiser.On the boat to Han's island, Lee and Roper both bet on a praying mantis match. Roper favors the larger of the two insects while Lee favors the smaller. Lee wins a handful of cash on the match. While Lee takes in the breeze from the harbor, an aggressive invitee named Parsons tries to antagonize him after tripping a boy carrying a load of fruit. He asks Lee about his fighting style; Lee answers it is ""the art of fighting without fighting"". Parsons scoffs, trying draw Lee into a match. Lee suggests that they take a small dinghy to a nearby island and match on the beach. When Parsons eagerly climbs down to the boat, Lee releases it from the sampan and lets it drift out behind, holding onto the rope and ordering Parsons not to pull himself in or he'll set him adrift on the ocean. Lee then hands the rope to the crewmembers, who are greatly amused.On the island, the passengers see hundreds of other martial artists practicing on giant courts. That night, everyone attends a lavish feast. Han arrives, bidding welcome to his guests, praising them for their skill and thanking them for attending. He has several women with him who act as his elite personal guard. He tosses several pieces of fruit in the air while the women hit them with small darts, thrown with pinpoint accuracy. Lee catches one of them. After dinner, Han's hostess, Tania, brings young women to Roper and Williams -- Roper requests to spend the night with Tania herself. The woman Williams is with warns him not to step outside his room when Williams wants to get some fresh air.When Tania visits Lee, he requests the young woman who threw the dart in the apple he'd caught at the banquet.
Lee meets with the dart thrower, Mei Ling, who is actually a spy sent by Braithwaite prior to recruiting Lee. She tells him that she's found out very little about Han's illegal activities except that many young women who come to the island disappear. Lee later sneaks out of his room. Evading Han's guards, he finds a hidden trapdoor that leads to several underground chambers where Han has been cooking heroin. He subdues a few of Han's guards and is forced to retreat when the possibility of being discovered becomes too great. As he sneaks back to his room, Williams spots Lee climbing a nearby wall.The next morning, Han attends the 1st few rounds of his tournament. He finds that Roper and Williams fight exceptionally well. Roper lays a few bets on Williams that pay off and has Williams lay down more bets. The two win a substantial amount of cash. Han appears and announces that one of his guests had been outside of their room after curfew and that some of his guards were attacked. He has his greatest fighter, Bolo, kill them all as punishment. Han later sends a message to Williams to meet him in his quarters. Roper is suspicious and tells Williams to watch his back.In his meeting with his host, Williams is praised by Han for his abilities, though they are unorthodox. Han mentions that Williams fights more for glory than harmony but Williams shrugs off Han's opinion, saying he fights to look good. Han then accuses him of attacking his guards the previous night. Williams is immediately angered, demanding that he be allowed to leave the island. Han refuses and a couple of his thugs attack Williams, who defeats them easily. Han himself takes up a combat stance and the two fight around the close quarters of Han's office. When Williams tries to kick Han in the hand, he inexplicably injures his foot. Han takes advantage and finally beats Williams down, killing him with a single blow. He removes the glove from his left hand, revealing that it's made of solid bronze.Back at the tournament, Roper beats a few opponents. Lee is called up to fight Oharra, one of Han's champions. With the memory of his dead sister to guide him, Lee lands several lightning-fast hits on Oharra. Oharra suddenly grabs one of Lee's feet with Han barking at him to let Lee go. Lee counterattacks with a vicious backflip kick to Oharra's chin that knocks him back. To finish him, Lee delivers a ferocious kick to Oharra's chest, knocking him into a few chairs and some of the spectators. Enraged, Oharra grabs two bottles, breaking them and brandishing the necks as weapons. Lee knocks the bottles from Oharra's hands and kicks him to the ground. Lee then lands a fatal blow to Oharra's throat. Han is flustered, telling the crowd that he has been disgraced by his champion and he leaves the court silently.Han later meets with Roper, showing him his extravagant home. One room is filled with glass display cases and Eastern weapons. In one case are the bones of a human hand. Han cheerfully says the severed hand is a ""souvenir"". He takes Roper into a room with a guillotine, placing own cat under the blade. He tells Roper that real loyalty is being able to kill at request but Roper refuses to pull the release rope that would kill the cat. Han pulls the rope, which activates a platform that lowers them into the lower levels of Han's house. Down there Roper sees Han's heroin lab and the prostitutes and prisoners he holds. Most of the women have vacant looks, as if drugged. Han makes Roper a generous offer to join his operation but Roper refuses when Han shows him the body of Williams, hanging over a deep pool. Roper is visibly upset at the sight of his dead friend and Han has the body dropped into the pool. Roper is taken prisoner.Needing to investigate further and to find a radio to get a message out to Braithwaite, Lee infiltrates the lower level again that night, picking up a cobra placed at the trapdoor to scare off any snoopers. Lee finds his way to the radio room, using the cobra to force the radio operators out. He gets his message out by telegraph. When he's discovered by Han's guards, he battles them, beating them with his fighting ability and their own weapons. After dispatching the last group, he rushes into another chamber but is trapped by closing metal doors. Above him, Han tells him that his fight with his guards was ""extraordinary"" and that he was planning to recruit him. Lee, however, has no desire and allows himself to be taken prisoner.The next morning on the tournament courts, Han orders Lee and Roper to be pitted against each other but they both refuse to fight. Han menacingly says he'll find opponents for them to fight, starting with pitting Bolo against Roper. Bolo carries the fight to his advantage for a few minutes until Roper battles back and lands a hard kick to Bolo's crotch, taking all the fight out of him. Infuriated, Han orders his men to attack both Roper and Lee. They find themselves easily defeated. Lee moves on Han, who takes off his fake fist and replaces it with a clawed appendage. Lee battles him, receiving a few slashes but is able to disarm Han when the drug lord has his claw stuck on a table. Meanwhile, Mei Ling frees all of Han's prisoners, directing them out to the tournament courts where they engage Han's men.Han runs off to his house with Lee right behind. In his trophy room, he takes an attachment for his wrist comprised of several sharp blades. The two square off - Han is able to slash Lee several times and wields a spear from his arsenal, however Lee is able to beat him back, forcing him to retreat behind a hidden door his spear becomes stuck in. Lee enters the room, finding it that it's entirely walled with mirrors. He moves slowly and deliberately, watching for Han. Han strikes a Lee a few times but Lee is finally able to work out an effective strategy: he begins breaking the mirrors around him, eliminating Han's advantage. He finally finds Han and gives him a vicious kick to the chest, impaling him on the spear he tried to use against Lee.Roper sits on the tournament court exhausted after the battle with Han's men. He glances to the side and sees that Tania is dead. Lee arrives back at the court and they exchange a parting glance. The final shot of the movie is of Han's claw stuck in the table."
tt0070046,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller']","Opening scene is set in June 1963 at a gathering of a group of shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures who are giving vent to their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. The scene takes place in the plush surroundings of the lead conspirator, Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), presumably a Texas oil baron. He and the others are trying to convince Ferguson (Will Geer), a white-suited and mustachioed figure a powerful oil magnate to back their plans for an assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He remains unconvinced saying ""I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work."" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group. The film then cuts to somewhere in the desert where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says that they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15 mph.The film intercuts between conversations among the lead conspirators, Farrington and Foster, and preparations for the assassination. The approval of the man in the white suit is crucial to the conspirators, although Farrington proceeds to organize two shooting teams in anticipation that he will change his mind.We then see sequences of Ferguson, the man in the white suit, watching contemporary newsreel and becoming clearly concerned at Kennedy's increasingly 'liberal' direction: action on civil rights for black people, Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, nuclear disarmament. The deciding moment comes when he's watching an anti-Kennedy news report on the deteriorating situation in South Vietnam. It is followed by Kennedy's ""suicidal"" October 1963 decision (National Security Action Memorandum #263, Oct. 11, 1963) to withdraw all US advisors from Vietnam by the end of 1965, effectively ending America's direct involvement in the Vietnam War. Ferguson picks up the phone to tell Foster he now fully supports their project.While the motives of the man in the white suit are clear, through dialogues between Foster and Farrington, the film attempts to cast light on the murky paranoid fears of the conspirators about the future of America and the white races. Foster forecasts the population of the third world in 2000 at 7 billion, ""Most of them yellow, brown or black. All hungry and all determined to love; they'll swarm out of their breeding grounds into Europe and America"". He sees Vietnam as an opportunity to control the developing world and reduce its population to 550 million: ""I've seen the data,"" says Foster, adding that they can then apply the same ""birth-control"" methods to unwanted groups in the US: poor whites, blacks and Latinos.The film postulates the same theory as JFK that Lee Harvey Oswald is being steered to become the conspiracy's 'patsy', but unlike JFK, the conspirators use a double of Oswald to shadow him in the weeks leading up to the assassination to leave behind a trail of evidence that the authorities can easily follow and link Oswald alone to the assassination.The film makes no explicit link to US government agencies and the conspiracy, although the professionalism of Farrington's shooting team clearly indicates they have worked for the CIA on special assignments. The film implies that most of the law enforcement and government agencies were not involved in the conspiracy, but they were just grossly inept: no special measures were taken for the president's safety in Dallas; there is no communication between the FBI, CIA, and Secret Service on possible security risks; even the head of the Secret Service stays in Washington during the visit. This explanation helps understand why the authorities were so keen to pin all of the blame on Oswald, the rogue assassin, who is 'served up' by the conspirators to the authorities as an easy escape from any accusations of their own negligence.On November 22, 1963 the assasination is carried out. The post-assassination conspiracy is also covered in the film. Farrington tells the head of the two shooting teams, who at this point don't know who their target is, that after this job he and his men will never have to work again and they can never meet one another ever again. All the assassins are black ops professionals trained never to talk about operations they are involved in. Each one is offered $25,000 per year for the next five years provided the operation's cover isn't blown by 'removing' any people who directly witnessed the assasination of Kennedy. If the cover remains intact in five years time ""every man jack of them"" will receive a further $100,000 into their Swiss bank accounts for another 10 or more years. The head of the shooting teams then tells Farrington: ""You just told me who we're going to hit.""At the end of the film, a photo collage is shown of 18 witnesses: all but two of whom died from unnatural causes within three years of the assassination. A voice-over says that an actuary of the British newspaper The Sunday Times calculated the probability that all these people who witnessed the assassination would die within that period of time to be 100 trillion to one."
tt0070047,"['Horror', 'contentRating', 'R']","Father Lancaster Merrin (Max Von Sydow) is an elderly Catholic priest on an archeological dig in Iraq. Merrin has a sense of foreboding and encounters a number of strange omens, including the unearthing of a series of confusing items, a near miss with a runaway horse drawn carriage, and a clock that stops ticking in mid-stroke. Finally, Merrin discovers a statue of a bizarre demonic figure; although the film does not mention it, it is a representation of a demonic figure known as Pazuzu.Back in the United States, in Washington D.C.'s upscale Georgetown neighborhood, a successful actress named Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) begins experiencing strange phenomena. Chris lives with her twelve-year-old daughter Regan (Linda Blair), her personal assistant Sharon (Kitty Wynn), and two housekeepers. Regan's father is estranged for reasons unknown. There are mysterious, unexplained sounds in the attic of the house, which Chris attributes to rats. Regan slowly begins to exhibit strange behavior, undergoing behavioral changes much like depression and anxiety. She turns up in Chris's bed one night, complaining that her own bed was ""shaking"".Chris is working on a new movie in Georgetown with a director known as Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran). While filming a scene one day, she notices a young Catholic priest watching her; his name is Damien Karras (Jason Miller). Father Karras has a background in psychology and counsels parishoners at a nearby church; Chris also notices him while walking home from the shoot one day.Karras is a thoughtful, conflicted man. He discusses his vocation with a superior and asks to be transferred because he feels he is losing his faith. He also has an elderly mother who lives alone in a slum in New York; he visits her and is reminded of how lonely her life is, and he feels guilty that she has to live in such poor surroundings.The strange occurrences in the McNeil house begin to increase. Regan reveals that she has been playing with a Ouija board and claims that she has the ability to communicate with a spiritual entity all by herself. A nearby Catholic church is desecrated, a statue of the Virgin Mary painted crudely and adorned with conical clay additions made to resemble breasts and a penis. Regan also works with clay and paint, making small animal sculptures.Meanwhile, Father Karras's mother falls ill and, due to a lack of funds, she is placed in a very shabby hospital and resigned to a ward full of mental patients. Father Karras is distraught when he visits her and she seems to blame him for her situation. Later, she passes away under these conditions, adding to his sorrow.Chris has an elaborate party at her home with a number of affluent guests. One of her guests is another Jesuit named Father Dyer (Rev. William O'Malley), and Chris asks him about Karras, having noticed him and referring to him as ""intense"". She finds that Karras and Dyer are good friends. During the party, Regan appears happy and social, but she reappears after being sent to bed, dressed in her nightgown and urinates on the carpet in front of the guests while making an ominous statement to a prominent astronaut (""You're gonna die up there""). After the guests leave, Chris bathes Regan and puts her to bed, but is startled by a loud sound from Regan's bedroom. She rushes back down the hall and discovers Regan's bed shaking violently, rising up off the floor with Regan on it. Chris jumps on the bed and it still levitates.Chris subjects Regan to a series of medical tests to discover what the problem is. The doctors are unable to discover anything, despite putting Regan through some grueling, painful procedures. The best they can come up with is that Regan may have a lesion on her brain, but ultimately they are frustrated when nothing appears on her brain scan. At Chris's house, Regan suffers what appears to be a seizure, and two doctors visit to assist. They find her rising and falling up and down on the bed in a way that seems impossible for a human being. When they try to sedate her, she hurls them across the room with abnormal strength, speaking to them in what seems to be a male voice: ""Keep away! The sow is mine!"" Eventually they sedate her.Out of options, they advise Chris to search for a psychiatrist, but they also reluctantly discuss another possibility: they mention the phenomenon of demonic possession and the rite of exorcism. While they seem to hold professional contempt for it, they do admit that it has been known to solve problems such as what Regan is going through. Chris is skeptical, having no real religious affiliation of her own.The situation worsens when Chris is out one evening; she returns to find the house deserted except for Regan, who is alone in her bedroom and appears to be in deep sleep. The bedroom is freezing cold, the window standing wide open, and she is uncovered. Sharon returns and Chris is furious with her for leaving Regan unattended, but Sharon explains that she left Regan in the care of Burke, who was visiting the house, while she went to the pharmacy to get Regan's medication. Burke's absence is unexplained until the doorbell rings and an associate of Chris's breaks the news that Burke has just died on the steps outside Chris's house.Shortly after this, Chris is visited by a kindly detective named Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb), who seems suspicious of Burke's death. He questions Chris about the events of that evening, and Chris is nervous, hesitant to tell him about Regan's problem. While he is visiting, he notices a few small animal figures that Regan has crafted; they are similar in style to the desecration of the statue in the church. Kinderman leaves and immediately a violent disturbance comes from Regan's bedroom. Chris hears a deep male voice bellowing at Regan to ""do it"", and Regan screaming in protest. In the bedroom, Chris finds Regan plunging a crucifix violently into her vagina. When Chris tries to stop her, Regan assaults her with impossible strength, and furniture around the room starts to move on its own. As Chris watches in horror, her daughter's head turns completely around backwards, and she speaks to Chris in Burke's voice, saying to her ""Do you know what she did? Your cunting daughter??"" Chris then realizes that Regan is responsible for Burke's death.Desperate, Chris arranges to meet with Father Karras, and when she mentions the notion of exorcism, Karras is almost amused. He tells her that exorcism is nearly unheard of, and that he doesn't know anybody who has ever performed one. Chris is distraught and convinces him to meet with Regan anyway. Karras is shocked by the girl's appearance; she is tied to the headboard of her bed, her face misshapen and covered in lesions, her voice deep and gravelly. Regan announces that she's the devil, and toys with Karras in a number of ways, seeming to make a drawer next to the bed open all by itself, then speaking to Karras in a number of languages. She also conjures up the voice of a subway vagrant that Karras has encountered alone earlier. Karras remains unconvinced, and when Regan claims ""Your mother's in here with us"", Karras asks her what his mother's maiden name is. Unable to answer, Regan vomits spectacularly all over him.Chris cleans Karras's sweater and discusses Regan with him. Karras is still not convinced that Regan is possessed, especially because Regan says she's ""the devil"", and he recommends psychiatric care for her. Chris pleads with him to help her obtain an exorcism, swearing that the ""thing"" in the bed upstairs is not her daughter.While Karras thinks it over, he is approached by Kinderman, who questions him about the fact that the desecration of the church could be connected to Burke's death; what he was unable to tell Chris was that Burke's body was found with his head turned completely around backwards, and the police department considers it a homicide. Kinderman knows that Karras suspects something unusual about the McNeil house, but his confidentiality as a priest prevents him from discussing it with Kinderman.Karras visits Regan again and records their conversation, during which he sprinkles Regan with water. He tells her it is holy water and she begins to writhe in pain, seemingly going into a trance and speaking in a strange language. Later he tells Chris that it will be difficult to make a case with the Bishop for possession; the water he sprinkled on Regan was simply tap water, and was not blessed. The Bishop, and Karras himself, would consider Regan to be mentally ill and not possessed. Chris confides in Karras and tells him that Regan was the one who killed Burke Dennings. Later, Karras uses his tape recordings of Regan's seemingly incomprehensible babble to discover that she is really speaking backwards, in English. A phone call from Sharon interrupts him; she summons him to the house to see Regan, not wanting Chris to see that's happening: as they look at Regan's unconscious body, the words ""help me"" begin to materialize on her stomach, rising up in her skin like scar tissue.Karras reluctantly agrees to try and get an exorcism for Regan, although he seems to have more in common with the doctors who recommended it as a form of shock therapy. The church calls in Father Merrin to perform the exorcism, with Karras assisting. Merrin has performed exorcisms in the past, including a difficult one that ""nearly killed him"", according to the Bishop. When Merrin arrives at the McNeil house, Regan bellows his name from upstairs, as if she knows him, and she makes strange animal sounds. He warns Karras about conversing with the demon, and reminds him that the demon will mix lies with the truth to confuse and attack them.When they enter Regan's bedroom, she immediately begins with a string of obscenities. Merrin and Karras recite the ritual of exorcism and Regan manifests strange phenomena such as levitation, telekinesis, an abnormally long tongue, and strange vomiting. She constantly curses the priests and emits evil laughter and verbal abuse. Regan begins to talk to Karras in the voice of his mother, and he starts to break down. Merrin sends him away; when he returns, he finds Merrin dead on the floor, the victim of a heart attack. Regan cackles gleefully, infuriating Karras, who grabs her and shouts at the demon, ""Come into me! Take me!"" The transference works almost immediately; Karras begins to transform and Regan returns to her normal self. Before Karras can harm her, his ""normal"" personality breaks through for a split second and he commits suicide, hurling himself out Regan's window. Just as Burke did, he tumbles down the stairs outside Regan's window and lays dying in the street below. By chance, Father Dyer happens upon the scene and administers the last rites to his friend.In a brief epilogue, we see Chris and Regan as they prepare to leave the house in Georgetown. They are visited by Father Dyer. Chris speaks with him privately and tells him that Regan doesn't remember anything about the possession or the exorcism. Regan then appears and greets him cheerfully, transfixed by Father Dyer's white collar. Before they leave, she suddenly hugs Father Dyer and kisses him. As Chris pulls away in their car, she orders the driver to stop for a moment and gives Father Dyer the religious medallion that belonged to Father Karras; in their struggle, Regan had torn it from his body and it was in her bedroom all along."

tt0070212,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'PG']","It is set in Harry Hope's decidedly downmarket Greenwich Village saloon and rooming house, in 1912. The patrons, who are all men except for three women who are prostitutes, are all dead-end alcoholics who spend every possible moment seeking oblivion in each others' company and trying to con or wheedle free drinks from Harry and the bartenders. They tend to focus much of their anticipation on the semi-regular visits of the salesman Theodore Hickman, known to them as Hickey. When Hickey finishes a tour of his business territory, which is apparently a wide expanse of the East Coast, he typically turns up at the saloon and starts the party. He buys drinks for everyone, regales them with jokes and stories, and goes on a bender of several days until his money runs out. As the play opens, the regulars are expecting Hickey to turn up soon and plan to throw Harry a surprise birthday party. The entire first act introduces the various characters and shows them bickering amongst each other, showing just how drunk and delusional they are, all the while waiting for the arrival of Hickey.When Hickey finally arrives, his behavior throws the other characters into turmoil. He insists, with as much charisma as ever, but now lumped together with the zeal of a recent convert, that he sees life clearly now as never before, because he is sober. He hectors his former drinking companions that they are meaninglessly clinging to ""pipe dreams"" of some kind of positive change in their lives, while continuing to drown their sorrows exactly as before. (This is true; the ex-cop and carny hustler tell each other they will ask for their old jobs back on the police force or with the circus, the bartender says he will marry his prostitute girlfriend, etc., with seemingly no chance of any of this coming to pass. One character is even nicknamed Jimmy Tomorrow for his constant protestations.) Hickey wants the characters to cast away their delusions and embrace the hopelessness of their fates. He takes on this task with a near-maniacal fervor. How he goes about his mission, how the other characters respond, and their efforts to find out what has wrought this change in Hickey, take over four hours to resolve. Eventually, after most of the characters briefly leave the bar intending to show Hickey that they actually intend to accomplish their dreams, they all return and are even more upset with Hickey. Hickey, who had earlier told the other characters that his wife had died and that she was murdered, admits that he actually killed her. The police arrive, apparently called by Hickey himself, and Hickey justifies the murder in a dramatic monologue, saying that he did it out of love for her. The other characters conclude that Hickey is insane. Almost everyone remains at the bar. At the end of the play, the youngest character, Don, kills himself."
tt0070215,"['Comedy', 'Western']","Aging gunfighter Jack Beauregard (Henry Fonda), tired of being hounded by people who want to kill him for various reasons, wishes to retire and leave the country for Europe. While he is still trying to come up with the money needed for a ship's passage he encounters a strange and quirky man who just calls himself ""Nobody"" (Terence Hill) and professes to be a fan of Jack.Nobody, who is a formidable gunman in his own right, doesn't like the idea of his hero simply vanishing away silently. He wants the name of Jack Beauregard to become a true legend, written down in the history books, and for this purpose he has dreamed up a conflict of truly epic proportions: pitting Jack alone against the 150-man-strong bandit gang, called ""The Wild Bunch"".Unable to believe that Nobody could be serious, Jack initially views Nobody as yet another rival gunman, who is just out to make a name for himself by killing Jack - but Nobody is indeed quite serious about his plan.The potential for such a conflict exists because of one Mr. Sullivan (Jean Martin), the owner of a worthless mine, through which the Wild Bunch is laundering stolen gold. Jack Beauregard's brother, called the Nevada Kid, used to be co-owner of the mine, until Sullivan killed him. Now Nobody is hoping that Jack will take revenge upon Sullivan, thereby earning the ire of the Wild Bunch.Sullivan himself expects Jack to come gunning for him as well and has already sent goons after Jack to kill him, on previous occasions. Those were foiled by Jack himself on one occasion and by Nobody on another. When Sullivan wants to hire gunmen for another attempt on Jack's life, Nobody pretends to take the job and - after some confrontational banter and gun-play - warns Jack of the ambush waiting for him, helping him dispatch the other two gunmen lurking in hiding.Jack, however, disappoints Nobody and defies Sullivan's expectations; he declines to exact blood vengeance for a brother who, he claims, was just as much of a crook as Sullivan. He merely corners Sullivan and takes off him the money he needs for his passage to Europe, then rides off along the train tracks toward New Orleans, where his ship is anchored.Not to be dissuaded so easily, Nobody absconds with a gold transport train that runs along those same tracks. Jack suddenly finds himself being followed by a slow-moving train that keeps pace with his horse but refuses to let him approach - and the Wild Bunch is thundering toward them from the horizon.Jack realizes that he can't escape the confrontation that Nobody has engineered and settles down, using the embankment of the tracks as cover, to fight off 150 bandits on his own. He remembers that, at an earlier point, he had seen some of the riders load up their saddle bags with dynamite, and is able to use the blinking of their gaudy decorations in the sunlight for aiming. He sets off several great explosions, cutting a huge swath through the bandit gang and reducing their number to a fraction of its former size.When the confrontation settles down to a prolonged gunfight, with both sides hunkered down and shooting from behind cover, Nobody drives the train forward again, between the two opposing sides, and allows Jack to board. Together they drive off toward New Orleans, leaving the remnants of the Wild Bunch behind.Now that Jack Beauregard's name in history is secured by a legendary victory, there is only one thing left to do, before he can leave for Europe: he must appear to die in battle. It turns out that even his strange choice of a name has been part of Nobody's plan for Jack all along - one staged duel in the streets of New Orleans and a public death scene later, the grave of Jack Beauregard bears the epitaph, ""Nobody was faster on the draw.""Jack can board his ship in anonymity and says farewell to Nobody with a letter wishing him luck, now that the remainder of the Wild Bunch and aspiring gunmen looking for fame will be gunning for him instead of Jack, while the old rules of the west are changing around them in modern times. Even as the letter is read in voice-over, Nobody is shown dealing with these threats in his own uniquely quirky style, demonstrating that if anybody can handle himself, it's Nobody."
tt0070239,"['Drama', 'History', 'Musical']","The camera pans across a landscape of desert hills dotted with stone ruins (""Overture""). A plume of dust in the distance resolves into a red and white bus that stops and disgorges a troupe of actors. The actors unpack costumes and props, including a large wooden cross. They dance around Ted Neeley, who will play Jesus, and dress him in a white robe. The actors, some still dancing, deploy themselves around the ruins of what might have been a temple.As Jesus talks with a group of followers, Judas (Carl Anderson) watches from a distance and worries (""Heaven on their Minds""). He's afraid that Jesus is beginning to believe what people are saying about him -- that he's God. He's also afraid that Jesus' followers will turn on him when they find that he isn't God, and that the Romans who occupy Judea will come down on them if they perceive Jesus' growing following as a threat to their rule.In the cave where Jesus and his followers are staying, the apostles ask when they're going to Jerusalem (""What's the Buzz?""). Jesus puts them off (""Don't you try to think ahead / Save tomorrow for tomorrow / Think about today instead""). Mary Magdalene (Yvonne Elliman), seeing that Jesus is hot and tired, tries to soothe him by bathing his face with cool water, which Jesus appreciates (""She alone has tried to give me / What I need right here and now""). Judas steps in to say he thinks it strange ""that a man like you / Can waste his time / On women of her kind."" Jesus responds angrily (""Who are you to criticize her?"") (""Strange Thing Mystifying"").Caiaphas (Bob Bingham) the high priest discusses Jesus with his associate Annas (Kurt Yaghjian). Like Judas, Caiaphas believes that Jesus' popularity will bring down the wrath of the Romans. He mentions talk of crowning Jesus king. They agree to take the matter to the priests' council (""Then We Are Decided"").Back at the cave, Mary sings to Jesus to relax him (""Everything's Alright"") and rubs ointment on his head and feet. Judas interrupts to scold Mary for wasting money on expensive ointment when it could have been used to help the poor. Jesus points out that they can't help everyone (""Surely you're not saying / We have the resources / To save the poor from their lot? / There will be poor always, / Pathetically struggling. / Look at the good things you've got!"") He adds that he'll soon be gone, a warning that no one but Judas seems to notice.In council, Caiaphas tells the other priests that Jesus is a danger to the nation, concluding ""Like John [the Baptist] before him / This Jesus must die"" (""This Jesus Must Die"").Jesus is carried into Jerusalem by cheering, palm-waving crowds (""Hosanna""). Caiaphas advises Jesus to disperse the mob because they're too loud. ""Nothing can be done to stop the shouting,"" Jesus replies joyfully; ""If every tongue was stilled the noise would still continue / The rocks and stones themselves would start to sing.""Later, in a big dance number, followers led by Simon Zealotes (Larry Marshall) tell Jesus how much they love him; at first he smiles at the crowd and laps it up. Simon urges Jesus to ""Keep them yelling their devotion / But add a touch of hate at Rome"" ... ""You'll get the power and the glory / Forever and ever and ever"" (""Simon Zealotes""). Jesus loses his smile while Judas looks on anxiously; this is the sort of thing Judas most fears. Some Roman soldiers march up and stop to watch, but Simon and his crowd are too wrapped up in their hero worship to notice. In a somber mood, Jesus tells the people -- and Mary, who kneels at his feet -- that none of them understand power and glory, and ""To conquer death / You only have to die"" (""Poor Jerusalem""). Simon is deeply puzzled.Pontius Pilate (Barry Dennen), a Roman official, sings of a dream in which he met ""a Galilean, a most amazing man. / He had that look you very rarely find, / The haunting, hunted kind."" Pilate foresees that he'll be blamed for the death of the Galilean in his dream (""Pilate's Dream"").Jesus visits the temple, which is like a modern-day flea market with modern-day merchandise (postcards, hand grenades) -- plus money lenders, of course. And prostitutes. Becoming angry (""My temple should be a house of prayer / But you have made it a den of thieves!""), Jesus runs around dumping tables and knocking over stalls (""The Temple""). Judas, again, watches in dismay. The vendors and customers flee. Jesus walks off into the hills, perhaps to calm down, but is accosted among the rocks by a crowd of the blind, halt, and sick, who beg to be healed. At first he reaches out to them, but he's unable to help them all and the mob seems to swallow him. He finally screams ""leave me alone!""Meeting Jesus as he walks back to their camp, Mary wraps him in a tattered blanket and sings to him as he lies down under a tent (""Everything's Alright (Reprise)""). As he sleeps, she muses about her love for Jesus, which confuses and frightens her (""I Don't Know How to Love Him""). ""I'm the one / Who's always been / So calm, so cool / No lover's fool ... I never thought I'd come to this.""Judas seems to be agonizing over something; he squats in an empty landscape, letting sand run through his fingers. When a row of Roman tanks appears over the crest of the hill and bears down on him, he runs to the temple. He's there to betray Jesus, but tries first to explain his motives to the uninterested priests (""Damned for All Time/Blood Money""). All they want to know is where the soldiers can find Jesus at a time when he's not surrounded by crowds. Caiaphas offers Judas a fee (""We'll pay you in silver / Cash on the nail""), which Judas turns down (""I don't want your blood money"") until Caiaphas points out that Judas can give the money to the poor -- he knows exactly which buttons to press. Judas takes the bag of money and says that Jesus will be in the Garden of Gethsemane on Thursday night.In the Garden of Gethsemane, the apostles are feeling mellow (""Look at all my trials and tribulations / Sinking in a gentle pool of wine"") and Jesus is feeling sorry for himself -- not without reason, given what he seems to know is about to happen to him. ""For all you care, this wine could be my blood,"" he says. (His petulance is a brilliant way to explain the rather odd, cannibalistic ideas behind the Eucharist.) He goes on to predict that ""one of you here dining"" will soon betray Jesus and another will deny knowing him. Judas exchanges some bitter words with Jesus before going off to bring the soldiers. The remaining apostles fall asleep and Jesus asks, ""will no one wait with me? Peter? John? James?"" (""The Last Supper"").Jesus goes for a walk to commune with God (""Gethsemane (I Only Want to Say)""). He asks whether he has to go through with his death, and asks to know the reason for it (""You're far too keen on where and how / But not so hot on why""). If God replies, it's not evident.Judas comes back with soldiers and identifies Jesus for them with his famous betraying kiss. Peter and the other apostles wake up and offer to defend Jesus (""Hang on lord, we're gonna fight for you""), but Jesus tells them ""it's all over"" and to ""stick to fishing from now on"" (""The Arrest""). The soldiers march Jesus back to the city, attracting a crowd as they go. Curious bystanders and journalists question him as he walks (""Do you think that you may retire? / Did you think you would get much higher? / How do you view your coming trial?""). Jesus doesn't answer. The soldiers take Jesus to Caiaphas, who asks if he's really the son of God. Jesus doesn't deny it, only replying ""that's what you say."" The crowd demands, ""take him to Pilate!""Peter, Mary, and another disciple stop at a camp along the road for water. A woman, a soldier, and an old man all recognize Peter (""you were with that man they took away""), but each time Peter claims not to know Jesus (""Peter's Denial""). Mary says sadly, ""It's what he told us you would do. / I wonder how he knew.""Jesus is frog-marched into the presence of Pilate, who makes fun of him, asks him if he's really king of the Jews, and dismisses his case to Herod (""Pilate and Christ""). King Herod (Josh Mostel), surrounded by wildly costumed, dancing courtiers, twits Christ in his turn. In ""King Herod's Song (Try It and See)"", he offers to let Jesus go if he'll perform a miracle. (""Prove to me that you're divine -- / Change my water into wine!"") When Jesus fails to respond, Herod declares him a fraud and sends him away.Mary Magdalen and Peter, standing on a stark mountainside overlooking the desert, wish for things to go back to the way they were before Jesus was arrested (""Could We Start Again, Please?""). They're backed by a crowd of followers. Jesus (who isn't really there, of course) turns and walks off into the desert.Soldiers throw Jesus into a pit, where Judas peers down at him until he's pushed away by a guard. Judas goes back to the priests to complain about how badly Christ has been treated, saying he'd save him the suffering if he could. Annas and Caiaphas tell Judas that events have unfolded just as he predicted, and ""What you have done / Will be the saving of Israel."" Judas isn't comforted and continues, in a song that includes a brief reprise of ""I Don't Know how to Love Him,"" to berate himself for the betrayal. Overcome with remorse, Judas hangs himself from a tree (""Judas' Death"").Jesus is taken back to Pilate, where the priests ask that Jesus be sentenced to death (""We need him crucified / It's all you have to do""). Pilate resists, saying Christ has committed no crime worthy of death and asking Jesus to defend himself. The crowd gets so agitated that Pilate agrees to flog Jesus (""Trial Before Pilate (Including the 39 Lashes)""). But it's not enough. Faced with an incipient riot and Jesus' insistence that nothing Pilate can do will prevent his death, a frustrated Pilate says ""die if you want to, you misguided martyr!"" and washes his hands.In another fantasy sequence, Judas descends from a star (lowered by a visible crane) to speak to Jesus, who is alone in the amphitheater where the trial was held. Judas points out that Jesus could have spread his message more easily if he'd come today (""Israel in 4 BC had no mass communication""). He asks Jesus why he chose ""such a backward time / And such a strange land?"" (""Superstar."")On a hilltop where two men have already been crucified, soldiers are pounding nails into something on the ground. They raise a cross on which Jesus is hanging, crowned with thorns. They jeer, but Jesus asks God to forgive them. A few of Jesus' followers, including a grief-stricken Mary, watch from below. The soldiers raise a ladder and nail a board to the cross above Jesus' head. It's just possible to make out the letters INRI on the board; they stand for Iesus Nazarenus, Rex Iudaeorum -- Jesus of Nazareth, king of the Jews. Jesus asks, ""my God, my God, why have you forgotten me?"", and says ""Father, into your hands I commend my spirit."" He dies.As the film ends, the performers, out of costume, reboard their bus.

tt0070274,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Romance']","Young and pretty factory workers are happy when - at the end of the day - the bell rings marking the time they may go home. The dark streets are menacing to a young girl alone, and one of them is harassed by two men and she has to dun to her place, and then run upstairs, as there's an electric fault and the lift doesn't work. But two other men, a bald-head and a fatso, are blocking her way - they are now a gang of four. Between the five of them, they drag her up the last flight of stairs to the rooftop, and strip her. She loses her lunchbox, and her virginity to the hoodlums: the fatso, the bald-head, the one with a necklace with a pendant, the one with a little mustache, and the laughing one.Chu Ling wakes up from her faint in time to watch from the window the five men roaring away in their motorbikes. She staggers to the landlady's room, and she starts arguing with her about the unpaid rent, telling Ling, ""Night shift... Bullshit."" The landlady's husband adds that she would better raise money by working at a nightclub. Unaided, Ling returns home to clean herself from her facial wounds and the vagina bleeding. Back to the factory, she picks up a knife - and in a rage, starts destroying the cloth she was working on.Released from work by the Factory Foreman, she is taken with pain in her sex, and goes to the WC of a commercial center to examine herself, and is horrified by what she sees. She doesn't go to a nearby hospital, because she is obsessed by the sound of bikers on the streets, and can't stand them without crying. Late that evening, she goes to the nightclubs' area, aiming to see again her rapists.She sees a bald man going into a bar, and goes in after him. She addresses him, but when she sees his face, she understands this is aging man, and asks his pardon. Instead, he grabs her, wanting her to join the girl he was with already. The Nightclub Manager intervenes, taking the girl out of the harassing patron's hands.Instead of going away, Ling asks the manager to work there. Wong eyes her up and down, and confers with his beautiful partner Hung at the office. She checks on the applicant's breasts, and find them OK, so she tells the manager to go on. He wants to know how old Ling is - 21 - and if her family knows about this. Ling says she has no family, and refuses to tell her reason to work there. Hung accepts Ling as her roommate, and leads her in her first night work next day.Ling is picked-up by two young men at once, and they start fondling her sex first thing, which she can't stand. She wants to run, but they grab her - and again she is saved by the Manager. The two men mock him, because he has a limp and a walking cane, and he proceeds to beat them.
Order is restored, and Hung comments she has worked in the place for three years, and never seen the Manager fight to defend a girl before.
Both Ling and Wong lower their eyes, with coy smiles.When the night comes to a close, the Barman is satisfied, counting the money in front of the staff: HK$ 2,356. Not enough, he says. The girls around him forward more money from their own pockets. Ling wants to know what the money is for. Hung tells her that it's for the funeral of one of them who's died of Vietnam Rose. Ling is unaware of it, and asks about it. One Bar Girl tells it's a form of syphilis brought by infected American soldiers from Vietnam, and describes the symptoms. Ling is worried enough, and then Hung tells the infected girls will die. Ling gives her all her money to the dead girl, HK$200, and runs away. Later, at Hung's place, she tries to hide the pain she is feeling from her, but Hung wont be fooled. She decides to take the girl to an unregistered Doctor who may help her.Doctor Huang closes the office's door from inside, and the heavy curtains, and tells Ling to undress completely. After checking her breathing, and breasts, he inspects her sex on the gynecological table. He tells her that she has the Vietnam Rose, and that's incurable - and yet he promises to treat her if she accepts being nice to him. She goes mad at the doctor, and stabs him with a pair of scissors, just ripping his white frock, and runs away without paying.Ling's attackers are now conducting an armed robbery at a jewelry shop. The Guard rings the alarm, and they shoot him dead, escaping with a lot of jewels, driving at speed through town. The leader instructs Atom, the bald-head driver, where to leave their car, and tells the others that the jewels will not be sold until much later.Ling asks Wong to teach her the killing kung fu, and confesses she needs it to take revenge on the men who have infected her with Vietnam Rose. He is reluctant to, but finally agrees. The painful lessons take place after hours, at the nightclub, with the Barman as a spectator.
Their intimacy progresses to the point of they becoming lovers - after another kung fu lesson at his place.Chung, Ling's attacker whose necklace with a pendant she had memorized during the attack, decides to spend some time with a girl at Ling's working place. Ling recognizes him by the pendant... Chung refuses to pay for Ling's ""night out"" and punches the Barman. The Manager is about to stop him, when Ling intervenes, and takes Chung out - after having hidden the Doctor's scissors in her knee boots. Chung goes to an underground car parking, and is about to rob a car, when he discovers neither he nor Ling have money to pay for the hotel room. So, he attempts to rob a well dressed man in the restroom, finds he only has cards and papers with him, and finally leaves with only the meager coins of the Restroom Attendant.Since he has no money, he stops the car in a desert place. She tells him, ""I love you to death."" Outside the car, she uses kung fu on him, he pulls a knife, she pulls her scissors, and manages to stab him to the crotch - killing him. Next, she's drunk at the nightclub.The news of the murder are already in the newspaper's front-page. She tells the Manager that she's sad that she killed the man before he could give him any clues about the other attackers. But the Manager says he knows who one of them is, the Pimp.The Pimp is taking two schoolgirls to a nightclub where there's go-go dancing, and drugs to spice the innocent girls' drinks. Drugged they're abused, stripped, and taken photos and filmed with an 8 mm camera to make further extortion demands from them. Then he tells they are to be taken to Mr. Wong, to be prostitutes, and walks back to the bar to have a drink - just as Ling arrives, asking for him. She remembers his continuous smile, the same as when he was raping her. She invites him to dance, and mid dance she tells him ""I am the lady on the rooftop."" His smile drops, but then comes back again to his face. They keep dancing, and at the top of the loud music and crowd's shouting, she stabs him repeatedly to the chest and belly. As most of the dancers fall to the floor exhausted, the Pimp falls to the floor, dying. She leaves the place in a hurry, and is seen by a friend of the Pimp who was in the street. This man goes up to the nightclub, and hears the Pimp's last words, ""The lady on the rooftop.""The Pimp goes straight to an underground casino, to tell his partners in the attack what happened. He had seen her face, that looked familiar, and then the Pimp's last words. The Crocodile had told Atom that he was going to the Springtime Bar, the night he was killed, so the bald-head - who still has the marks of Ling's fingernails on his bald head - and they decide to kill her, leaving the did to Heroine, the man with the little mustache. Heroine follows Ling through the dark streets, again. He pulls a razor blade, and she runs. She manages to hide for a moment behind a parked Volkswagen, and when she sees two policemen doing their beat, she shows herself - and feigns to faint in the middle of the street. The cops decide to escort her home, and she manages to wave a goodbye kiss in the direction of the Pimp - who's now hiding behind the same car.As the cops go away, the Pimp tries to locate Ling again, but fails. Hung is there, but with no avail for Ling's pains, who are getting worse.
Hung puts on Ling's fur coat, and goes out to search for medicine. The Pimp mistakes Hung for Ling, and stabs her a couple of times. She manages to frighten him away by shouting and throwing her playing cards at him - their cutting edges hurting his face a bit. The Pimp runs away, but Ling goes after him, and they face up again at a cemetery. He tries to hit her with a spike-ax, she kicks him to the crotch, disarms him, and kills him with the spike-ax to the groin.Back at home, Hung tells Ling about that man, Heroine, one who had disgraced her years before with his two friends, Wong and Atom, at a casino. She gives the address of the Yan Chai Casino to Ling. Hung is too hurt to accompany Ling in her quest, but she offers her her playing cards, that have thin blades hidden under the usual art surfaces, so that she may face multiple enemies at the casino. Hung teaches Ling how to throw several cards at once, and they stuck deep in a wall. Ling proves to be a fast learner.The Casino Boss decides to play poker against Ling, but she beats him. When he raises the next bet to HK$50,000 it's time for her to raise the stakes - he demands her body for the night if she loses, and she demands he hands her Wong and Atom if he loses. ""Why?"" he asks. ""We've debts to settle,"" she answers. He accepts, and for a moment he thinks he has won. But she has a straight flush that beats him again. She sets the encounter for 3 a.m. the next day, and tells him to identify her just as ""the lady on the rooftop, they'll understand"".Ling returns to the Springtime Bar, to present her resignation as a bar girl, and spend some romantic time with the Manager. He promises to take her away to somewhere else, after shes kills the two two men next morning. The two thugs make a phone call to Hung's apartment, harassing her, and then cut the phone wires, preventing her to call the police. She has barricaded herself, and is armed with a knife. Atom escalates the outside wall and breaks in through a bay-window, while Wong, who has a spiked knuckleduster, breaks the front door in.
They attack her, rip her nightgown away, and beat her to death despite her fighting back.Atom and Wong report to the Casino Boss, and then go out to hire more thugs to defend them. As 3 a.m. are about to strike, the Casino Assistant #2 closes the place, sending the last players out. Ling mounts the stairs to the casino, afflicted with pain from her crotch, and finds the place deserted and with no lights. Then the lights go up, and Ling finds herself surrounded by Atom, Wang, the Casino Boss, and four thugs. There's a long fight in which she takes a number of blows, and her clothes are ripped. She surprises them by starting to do a trick with the pack of cards, and then wounds the men with her recently learned throwing ability.Ling is down again when the door opens, and Wong comes in with his walking cane to give her a hand. Wong engages the thugs in a long fight with weapons, his cane at a point turning up to be a sword-cane. Wang and Atom run away, and Ling - who's just recomposed herself - goes after them, leaving her boyfriend Wong to battle the rest of the gang.She catches up with the fugitives in a corridor, and hunts them down an outside spiral staircase to the street. The fight proceeds until she stabs Atom to the neck with a pair of scissors, but he stabs back at her crotch with the jagged end of a broken beer bottle. She then stabs him to the crotch with Atom's knife, but Wang stabs her back repeatedly with the knuckle-duster. She stabs back at his crotch with the scissors, and the three fall to the ground grabbing their crotches, and oozing blood.Despite his infirmity, Wong jumps from a first floor to catch Thugs #1 and 2 who were trying to escape his fury, and again they fight, now on the street. He strikes both to the belly with his sword-cane, and they fell apparently dead.The police is arriving at the spot, and Wong lifts up the badly wounded Ling."

When the boys joke about a policeman named Collins, their father admonishes them to treat the man with respect. On that night's delivery run, Junior evades arrest by listening to the police on his CB radio and eventually running a roadblock which forces Collins to jump into a watery ditch. The next day, Collins retaliates by blowing up Mr. Jackson's whiskey distillery and arresting him.When Wayne informs Junior that his humiliation of Collins has put their father in prison, Junior goes to the jail with a lawyer, attempting to take responsibility for the incident, but his father stoically accepts his fate. The lawyer advises Mr. Jackson to renounce bootlegging in court to lessen his sentence, but Mr. Jackson refuses on principal, arguing that everyone at city hall drinks his whiskey.The next day, Junior talks to a racing promoter named Hackel (Ned Beatty) about entering the local demolition derby in order to raise money for his father's legal defense. Hackel ridicules the backwoods boy, but Junior persists and is allowed to compete. Junior's brother and friends help him prepare an old car for derby day with a spike to project from the grill so that he can ram his competitors' vehicles, an innovation that excites the crowd and wins him $200.Invited to the next derby, Junior replies that he will enter the stock car race instead and again Hackel scoffs at him. To prove his skill, Junior times himself on the track that night and is so fast that he is allowed to enter. During the race, Junior amazes the crowd with his fearless driving and wins first prize. Afterward, Junior drives to city hall to attend his father's trial, but discovers that the trial has already ended and his father has been sentenced to a year in prison for refusing to denounce moonshine.Unaware that his mother (Geraldine Fitzgerald) is in attendance, Junior wins his eighth race on Hackel's track, which ends with another driver attacking Junior over his aggressive maneuvers. After the fight, Hackel brands Junior a troublemaker and orders him never to return, to which Junior retorts that he is a star and will race at the more prestigious Hickory racetrack.That night, worried about Junior's safety, Wayne and his mother urge him to take a job as a garage mechanic, which he angrily refuses due to the low pay. During Junior's next visit to the jail, when his father tells him that ""one man's foolishness is the breath of life to another,"" Junior realizes that only his father understands him and gives him his trophy.Needing money for a faster car, Junior continues delivering moonshine, now in a truck with a tank that he and Wayne have equipped with a release valve that dumps the whiskey onto the road if the police get too close. However, when the sons proudly tell their father about the invention, he chastises them for antagonizing the police.Junior arrives at the Hickory racetrack to announce to the owner Morley (Gregory Walcott) and racing star Kyle Kingman (William Smith) that he will win the next race, but Morley, who knows Junior's reputation, replies that he has declined Junior's entry. In response, Junior surprises Morley by producing a pit pass and a rule book that states he has a right to qualify.After successfully completing his trial run, Junior goes into the office where he meets Morley's friendly assistant and secretary, Marge Dennison (Valerie Perrine), and thanks her for sending him the pass and rule book. As Junior signs the entry papers, Marge tells him about his motel accommodations and puts his name on the list for the buffet, adding that he can bring a guest. When Junior invites Marge to dinner and she replies that she has a date, he grins and says he does not discourage easily.That evening, when Junior checks into the motel he finds that Marge has gotten him a discount on his room and has flowers delivered to her. As he is getting out of the shower, Junior, wearing only a towel, is flustered when Marge knocks and enters, thanking him for the flowers and flirting while he dresses for dinner.At the buffet and party, Marge dances with Kingman while Junior sees driver Rick Penny (Lane Smith) arguing with his manager, Burton Colt (Ed Lauter). When Penny complains to Junior afterward, Junior disdainfully suggests he work for himself and as Junior drives Marge home, he derides the other drivers as hired jockeys.After dropping Marge off, Junior goes into a recording booth where he makes record for his family, telling them about Hickory and finally apologizing to his father, saying that he loves him, but throws the record in the trash as he leaves. Back in his room, Junior calls Marge and is shocked when Kingman answers, but is later cheered when his friends show him their new team jackets emblazoned with his name.On the day of the race, Junior sees Marge waving from the stands and sadly realizes that she is waving at Kingman. The race begins and Junior pulls ahead with his friends cheering him on, while Penny falls behind as his manager bullies him over a radio. When Junior's car catches fire he is unhurt, but is unable to complete the race, which Kingman wins. Impressed with Junior's driving, Colt takes advantage of the destruction of his car by offering to make him one of his drivers, but Junior refuses to be bought, vowing to get a new car and beat Colt and everyone else.While celebrating Kingman's victory with him, Marge meets his wife, Trina (Erica Hagen), who makes it clear that Marge should end the affair with her husband. Calmly accepting this, Marge turns to Junior and they proceed to her apartment where they have sex for the first time. They are startled when their post-sex romantic conversation is interrupted by Kingman unlocking the door, but Kingman smiles and tosses his key to Junior for future use.Later back home, Mr. Jackson returns from jail after being paroled early for good behavior, but when his sons show him their new underground still, he angrily destroys it, saying he does not want Junior to risk his racing career by bootlegging. When Junior retorts that he needs money for a new car, his father slaps him, saying that Elroy Jackson, Jr. will find a way.Seeing no alternative, Junior offers to drive for Colt in exchange for 50% of the prize money. Colt inflexibly counters with his terms of 30% and demands that Junior wear his uniform, drive his car and use his crew. Junior eventually accepts and begins the Hickory 500 race with Colt coaching him through an earpiece, which Junior soon discards and proceeds to race his own way.Junior and Kingman compete for the lead throughout the grueling contest until Junior finally triumphs. In the winner's circle, Junior is joined by his friends and Colt. As they are celebrating, Marge congratulates Junior and although he is relieved that she is no longer with Kingman, he sadly watches her leave with another driver. When Colt threatens to dock half of Junior's $3,000 prize money for insubordination, Junior grabs the trophy, saying that his racing talent gives him the power in their relationship. Junior then informs Colt that he will continue racing for him only if he can retain 60% of future prize money and use his own car and crew. Colt reluctantly accepts the deal.In the final scene, as his brother and friends enjoy skipping stones at a local pond, Junior walks alone into a press conference as flashbulbs pop and he is asked by the reporters where he, Junior Jackson, is going to race next."
tt0070294,"['Horror', 'contentRating', 'PG']","Physicist Lionel Barrett is enlisted by an eccentric millionaire, Mr. Deutsch, to make an investigation into ""survival after death"" in ""the one place where it has yet to be refuted."" This is the Belasco House, the ""Mount Everest of haunted houses,"" originally owned by the notorious ""Roaring Giant"" Emeric Belasco, a six-foot-five perverted millionaire and supposed murderer, who disappeared soon after a massacre at his home. The house is believed to be haunted by numerous spirits, the victims of Belasco's twisted and sadistic desires.Accompanying Barrett are his wife, Edith, as well as two mediums: a mental medium and Spiritualist minister, Florence Tanner, and a physical medium, Ben Fischer, who is also the sole survivor of an earlier investigation. The rationalist Barrett is rudely sceptical of Tanner's Christian faith and spiritual beliefs, asserting that there is nothing but unfocused electromagnetic energy in the house. Barrett brings a machine he has developed, which he believes will rid the house of any paranormal presence or force.Though not a physical medium, Tanner begins to manifest physical phenomena inside the house. When, after a quarrel with Tanner, Barrett is attacked by invisible forces, he suspects that Tanner may be using the house's energy against him. Meanwhile Fischer remains aloof, with his mind closed to the house's influence, and is only there to collect the generous pay offered him to return.Edith Barrett is subjected to erotic visions late at night, which seem linked to her lackluster sex life. She goes downstairs and, in a seeming trance, disrobes and demands sex from Fischer. He instead strikes her, snapping her out of the trance, and she returns to herself, horrified and ashamed. A second incident occurs a day or so later (this time, she is awake but uninhibited due to alcohol); her husband arrives a moment later to witness her advances to Fischer and is resentful, stating to Fischer's face that he believes that Fischer no longer has any psychic ability and that ""Mr. Deutsch is wasting one-third of his money!"" Stricken by the accusation, Fischer finally drops his psychic shields but is immediately attacked.Tanner, convinced that one of the ""surviving personalities"" is Belasco's tormented son Daniel and determined to prove it at all costs, finds a human skeleton chained behind a wall. Believing it to be Daniel, Tanner and Fischer bury the body outside the house and Tanner performs a funeral. Despite this, Daniel's personality continues to haunt Tanner; she is scratched violently by a possessed cat and Barrett, seeing the scratches, suspects that Tanner may be mutilating herself. In an attempt to put the supposed Daniel to rest, Tanner gives herself to the entity sexually, and later appears to be possessed herself, temporarily.Barrett's machine is assembled. Tanner attempts to destroy it, thinking that it will harm the spirits in the house, but is prevented. She enters the chapel, the unholy heart of the house, in an attempt to warn the spirits, and is crushed by a falling crucifix. (During her dying moments, she leaves a clue written in her own blood, to the true source of the haunting, which she now knows.) Barrett meanwhile activates his machine, which seems to be effective. Finally activating his psychic abilities as he wanders in the house, Fischer declares the place ""completely clear!"" in astonishment. However, soon afterwards, violent psychic activity resumes and Barrett is killed.Fischer decides finally to confront the house, with Edith accompanying him despite her misgivings. In the chapel, a confrontation ensues: thanks to clues from the manner in which Tanner, Barrett and the previous investigators had died, Fischer deduces that Belasco is the sole entity haunting the house, masquerading as many. He taunts Belasco, declaring him a ""son of a whore"", and that he was no ""roaring giant"", but likely a ""funny little dried-up bastard"" who fooled everyone about his alleged height. Even as objects begin to hurl themselves at Fischer, he continues to defy the entity, until all becomes still, and a portion of the chapel wall shatters, revealing a hidden door.Going inside, Fischer and Edith discover a lead-lined room, containing Belasco's preserved body seated in a chair. Pulling out a pocketknife, Fischer rips open Belasco's trouser leg, discovering his final secret: a pair of prosthetic legs. Fischer and Edith realise Belasco had had his own stunted legs amputated, and used the prosthetics in a grotesque attempt to appear imposing. Belasco had the lead lined room specially built (Belasco himself possibly suspecting the electromagnetic nature of life after death that Barrett's theories predicted), in the event of his death, to preserve his spirit, afraid of what may happen otherwise.With the room now open, Fischer activates Barrett's machine a second time, and he and Edith leave the house, expressing hopes that Barrett and Tanner will guide Belasco to the afterlife without fear."
tt0070300,"['Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Thriller']","1930s. Lila Lee [Cheryl ""Rainbeaux"" Smith], the Singin' Angel of the Community Baptist Church of
Tylerville (North Carolina?), is a sweet and innocent 13-year old whose
gangster father Alvin [William Whitton] just shot his wife and her lover, ran down an old
lady in the street, and is now running from the law. Reverend Mueller [Richard Blackburn], who
has a hard time keeping his hands off his ward Lila, has made it clear to
the parish that the sins of her father should not be blamed on Lila, but
when Lila gets a letter from a woman named Lemora, instructing her to come
to her sick father and forgive him his sins against her, Lila makes her
way that very night to the Northpark bus station just in time to catch the
bus (driven by a very creepy bus driver) to Asteroth.Along the road to Asteroth, an isolated little town in the salt
marshes, the bus is pursued by several monstrous-looking ghouls, visible
from outside Lila's window. When the bus breaks down and the bus driver
tries to fix it, the ghouls close in. Lila releases the brake and coasts
down the hill until she crashes into a tree. The ghouls begin to approach
when suddenly they are attacked by vampires (aristocratic-looking with
white faces, long black coats, and top hats). Lila passes out. When she
awakens, she finds herself imprisoned in a stonehouse and tended to by a
weird old lady named Solange [Maxine Ballantyne]. [Lemora later explains that the bars weren't
to keep Lila IN but to keep other things OUT.] Lila manages to escape the
stonehouse and to hide in a crawl space under a porch, where she overhears
Lemora [Lesley Gilb] talking to her father. When a spider lands on her arm, Lila
screams. Lemora finds her, brings her into the house, and prepares a room
for her. Lemora explains that Lila can see her father after the ceremony
tomorrow, when she will become immune to his ""disease.""When Lila explores the old Victorian house and her bedroom in
particular, she sees some very strange things. For example, the mirrors
have no mirrors. There is a plate of raw meat set on Lila's bed as you
would a bowl of candy (Lila helps herself to several pieces). She looks
out the window when she hears screams and sees a young child being forced
into the stonehouse. When she takes out her mirror from her suitcase, she
notices that Lemora casts no reflection in it. Lemora introduces Lila to
her five freaky, ""adopted"" children, all of whom sit down for a repast of
goblets of something that looks like blood (Lila drinks hers).Suddenly, a crash is heard. Everyone runs to the room where the sound
came from, and Lila sees a bed that she assumes was her father's sickbed.
Lemora hurriedly makes the bed, hiding the restraining straps, and
explains that her father's disease occasionally makes him delirious and
that he must have broken loose. He'll be found, she assures Lila, then
tells her to get ready for her bath, during which Lemora attempts to get
the crucifix off Lila's neck, but to no avail. When Lemora leaves the room
for a few minutes, Lila's ghoulish father breaks in and chases her until
Lemora scares him off with fire and Lila flies into Lemora's arms for
protection. Lemora explains that a year ago some of her people began
turning ugly and that it is now necessary to kill them all, including her
father. Lemora then carries a tired Lila upstairs and lovingly puts her to
bed.This is just what Lemora was hoping -- that Lila would come to love
and trust her, unlike Mary Jo Spinks, another 13-year old girl who was a
weakling and couldn't stand her ""love"". When Lila finds Mary Jo's diary,
written in 1892, in which she describes something happening to her that is
so horrible she must kill herself, Lila realizes that she has to get away
from Lemora, too. Dressed in her nightgown, Lila quietly creeps down the
stairs and goes out the front door. Once in the yard, Lila peeks through a
window and sees Lemora drinking the blood from the neck of the young child
that was locked in the stonehouse. Finally coming to the realization that
Lemora is a vampire, Lila screams. Lemora looks up.The chase is on. Lila runs through the trees and is pursed by ghouls.
She hides in the back of a hearse and is delivered to a group of vampires
in Asteroth who also take pursuit. Lila runs in and out of buildings, up
and down stairs, past human bones and corpses, including that of Mary Jo
Spinks, until she takes shelter in an abandoned house. Unfortunately,
Lemora is waiting for her there. Lemora offers to make Lila into her real
self and promises that she won't mutate into one of those ghouls because
of the goodness in her heart. Lila refuses. Out in the streets, the ghouls
and vampires are fighting each other, driving stakes through each others'
hearts. Suddenly, Lila is attacked again by her ghoulish father. Lila pulls the stake from Lemora's
heart, and her father falls on it. Of course, removing the stake from
Lemora brings her back to life. Lemora takes Lila into her arms and
removes the crucifix from around her neck.Meanwhile, the Reverend has been looking for Lila. He passes through
Asteroth and stands in the street shouting Lila's name. For some reason,
he falls asleep. When he awakens, he is lying next to Lila, who is kissing
him. He kisses her back ardently. He looks up into Lila's face and sees
that her teeth have turned to fangs just as she bends forward and bites
his neck. Lemora looks on and smiles.Epilogue [added postproduction]: Lila is still in church, singing ""Rock of

Through his alter ego, Mr. Big, Kananga plans to distribute the heroin free of charge on the market, which will drive all the other drug cartels out of business, increase the number of addicts, and give Kananga a monopoly of the heroin market. Using the serial number on Bond's watch, Kananga tests Solitaire's truthsaying powers. She fails but Kananga does not reveal the outcome in front of Bond; after Bond is escorted out of the room, he chastises Solitaire harshly for her betrayal and leaves her in the hands of Baron Samedi to be sacrificed in ritual on San Monique.Kananga turns Bond over to Tee Hee Johnson, a thug with a mechanical arm, who takes Bond to the Farm, a community in the Louisiana backwoods filled with alligators and crocodiles and housing one of Kanaga's heroin labs. Bond is left on a small island to be food for the gators but he jumps on the backs of the reptiles to reach the shore. He sets the Farm on fire, killing some of Kananga's men. He steals a speedboat leading to a furious chase with Kananga's men in pursuit and the local sheriff, J.W. Pepper, and the Louisiana state police trying to blockade Bond and his pursuers. Bond evades them all and is met by Leiter who informs him that Kananga, Samedi and Solitaire left for San Monique.Bond goes back to San Monique, ordering Quarrel Jr to plant explosives in the poppy fields. Bond interrupts the voodoo sacrifice, rescuing Solitaire. While Bond holds the ritual attendees at bay, Baron Samedi pops up from a grave. Bond shoots him, finding he's a ceramic decoy, however, the real Samedi appears. Bond fights the man briefly & the villain ends up falling in a coffin full of poisonous snakes, seemingly bitten to death. Bond and Solitaire travel below ground into Kananga's lair. They find Kananga, who tells Bond that his wet suit was found and that the explosives he used on the poppy fields have done too little damage to interrupt production. Bond and Solitaire are lashed to a small crane over a shark pool; Kananga slashes Bond's forearm several times, drawing blood to bait the sharks. Using his magnetic watch, Bond retrieves a gas pellet from his shark gun and cuts the ropes holding him. After a brief fight with Kananga, he forces the gas pellet in Kananga's mouth, rapidly inflating the villain who floats to the top of the room and explodes.After the job is done, Felix leaves Bond and Solitaire on a train out of the country. Tee Hee makes a last attempt on Bond's life and is ejected from their train compartment at high speed. However Baron Samedi is seen perched on the nose of the speeding train in his voodoo ensemble and laughing heartily."
tt0070332,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","This isn't perfect - I'm doing this from memory. But 'til now, there was no synopsis at all.The movie revolves around a minor feud between the Feather and Gutshall families. They dispute ownership of a small plot of land.As a prank and to provoke the Feathers, two of the Gustshall brothers forge a romantic postcard to themselves, from a fictitious girl named ""Lolly Madonna."" The postcard ends ""Lolly Madonna XXX"" (XXX meaning kisses).The Feathers find the postcard and decide to kidnap the girl to provoke the Gutshalls. They find a pretty girl, a stranger to the mountain, at a bus stop. The Feather brothers presume she's ""Lolly."" The girl says her real name is Roonie Gill, but the Feathers don't believe her and kidnap her anyway.Pap (Robert Ryan) decides to save Roonie (""Lolly""), even though he doesn't know her. The two families have minor skirmishes, but each one escalates.The Feathers steal a pig from the Gutshalls, partly as a prank. Sister E Gutshall comes to get the pig back, and seems also to want to visit with Hawk feather, on whom she has a crush. She watches as Hawk, a hopeful country singer, singing and performs as he fantasizes he's on stage.Sister E taunts Hawk, who chases her. He catches her and they start to make out. (I think) Skylar wants to join in, but Sister E resists. Both brothers end up raping Sister E. She goes home to her mom and dad crying. This further enrages the parents against the Feather family.Two Feather sons and their father, Laban, stake the stolen pig out where Pap Gutshall can see it. They threaten to shoot it if Laban doesn't give them title to some disputed land between them. The argument escalates and the Feathers set fire to the grass around the pig. Roonie attempts to rescue the pig, but can't. Pap shoots the pig to put it out of its misery in the fire.Fuming for revenge, Pap has Ludie, his overactive son, and Villum his Vietnam-vet son start an attack on the Feather house.Inside the Feather house, it appears there's a dark secret which has torn the family apart. Laban hates his son Thrush, who goads Laban into beating him up. Through flashbacks during the beating, we see that the two families were once close friends, bonded through the marriage of Zack (Jeff Bridges) and the daughter of Pap. Thrush was good with horses and trained the horse Pap's daughter loved. I found it odd that Zack was the only non-bird named son in the Feather family. Even the mom is named ""Chickie.""In the flashback, we see there was once love and happiness in the family. It all ended with a tragic accident, in which Zack's wife, who is also Pap Gutshall's daughter, fell off a horse and was killed. Laban kills all the horses including the ""guilty"" one, and forever blames Thrush, who trained them all. We see at the end of the flashback that Laban has beaten Thrush to death.Meanwhile, Pap's son Zeb (Gary Busey) has come to make peace and is held hostage instead. It's apparent that Laban is losing his mind and the violence will escalate even further out of control.Skylar Feather decides this is all too much. The only way to live is to escape. He offers to take Roonie away to safety, but sees she and Zack are obviously in love. He leaves on his own. Ludie and Villum see the truck. Villum uses his sniper rifle to kill Skylar just as he drives off the property.Ludie and Villum set up a siege of the Feather house. There is gunfire between them and those inside. Hawk is fatally injured. He makes a last stand on the porch, wearing his on-stage jacket. Hawk is hoping to go out in style and perhaps end the battle. Villum shoots Hawk again. As he dies he has one final on-stage fantasy.Laban finally retreats into total insanity. Zack banishes him to his room, where he prepares sandwiches of ketchup and mayonnaise.In revenge for the killing of Hawk, Chickie Feather shoots and kills the hostage Zeb. Now, they have no cards to play and have to battle it out to the end.Ludie attacks the Feather house with egg ""grenades"" and Zack shoots him. Villum makes an angry charge and is also shot to death.Pap sadly walks back to his home, childless. His wife retreats to her room. It's obvious she is disgusted with this ""war"" and has no more respect or love for Pap.I believe Finch, the retarded Feather son, is still alive at the end. Chickie is left with him and the insane Laban. It appears that Zack and Roonie will leave the battle-scarred mountain and start a better life together somewhere else.That's the best I remember how it ends. Like Vietnam, there were no winners, except maybe those who ran off (to Canada, in the US case).Hope this has been helpful. It should be close to accurate. Feel free to improve upon it. My memory isn't what it used to be!YouTube has a behind the scenes video of this movie:(add "" /watch?v=JabMYjwYO7c "" to the their URL)Sister E. Gutshall (I have no idea what the E stands for) is still alive at the end, but she is shown taking off suitcase in hand too. Also, it wasn't Hawk she was in love with. It was Skylar. It was really a good movie, but the ending was so sad."
tt0070355,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","The opening credits are played over a shot of a Smith & Wesson Model 29 revolver against a red background. When the credits finish playing, Harry Callahan's voice tells the audience, ""This the .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. And it could blow your head clean off. Do you feel lucky?"" The hand turns the revolver and fires at the camera.Labor racketeer and local mobster Carmine Ricca (Richard Devon) drives away from court after being acquitted on a technicality for the killing of a labor union leader and his family, much to the outrage of a mob of protesters outside the courthouse. A San Francisco Police Department motorcycle cop with a photo on his dresser sees this on a TV broadcast and puts on his helmet and gear, then leaves his house.Ricca, his attorney Weinstein, a bodyguard, and his driver James ""Gino"" Cantina drive a limo south on I-280 towards Potrero Hill. The motorcycle cop we just saw earlier catches up to the car and gestures for the driver to pull over. The driver pulls off onto a side street at the next exit, and comes to a stop. The cop walks up to the car and asks the driver for his license, telling him that he illegally crossed a double-white line. At Ricca's attorney's urging, the driver reluctantly hands over his license. The cop goes back to his bike, supposedly to write down information in his ticket book. After a few minutes, he returns and asks the driver for his vehicle registration. The driver asks to get his license back. In response, the cop suddenly whips his revolver out and shoots the limo driver in the side of the face. He then shoots the bodyguard in the passenger's seat as he tries to draw a pistol. He then puts two bullets each into Ricca and his attorney in the backseat. With all four men dead, the cop holsters his smoking revolver, walks back to his motorcycle and rides away.Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) and his partner Earlington 'Early' Smith (Felton Perry) drive by the crime scene, but are asked to leave by Harry's newest adversary on the force, the hot-tempered Lt. Neil Briggs, who had Harry ""loaned"" from Homicide to Stakeout because he despises his methods (presumably also angered that Harry got his badge back after throwing it away in disgust following the Scorpio case). The loathing is mutual; Harry detests Briggs because of Briggs's hands-off, bleeding-heart law enforcement methods - Riggs proudly boasts that he's never upholstered his gun once in all his years of police work, which leads the unimpressed Harry to mock Briggs with the words, ""A man's got to know his limitations.""Harry and Early leave the scene and head to San Francisco International Airport to take lunch at a snack shop run by Bill McKenzie, a former buddy of Harry's from the force. Early, as a comparatively wet-behind-the-ears youngster on the force, is grossed out when McKenzie talks about the Ricca killing and a case he worked on involving a gruesome axe murder, all the while Harry chows down on his burger as though nothing is untoward.But a code signal for trouble comes, and Harry notices a group of concerned airport officials gathering around a small cul-de-sac. Harry investigates and finds that airport security is sweating out the hijacking of a jetliner; Harry flashes his badge and learns the hijackers want an overseas pilot, so Harry makes a suggestion.Dressed as a pilot, Harry gets aboard the plane and begins taxiing towards the runway for takeoff, but when the copilot asks if he knows how to fly, he admits that he never had a lesson... which shocks the gunmen in the cockpit long enough for Harry to disarm one and kill the other, and gives him opportunity to show up Lt. Briggs when he arrives at the scene. The dislike between Callahan and Briggs thus escalates; when the surprised Briggs arrives at the now-freed aircraft Harry mockingly asks him, ""What are you doing here, Lieutenant?"" and leaves while the lieutenant seethes at being shown up.Later Harry arrives at a target range near Oakland and encounters an old friend, traffic officer Charlie McCoy (Mitchell Ryan). McCoy has recently left his wife Carol, though it is clear he still holds her close to his heart, and is bitter over how his life has changed. Harry, concerned, suggests Charlie retire, but Charlie vows never to do so and instead ""go out fighting"".In the target range Harry encounters four rookie traffic cops Philip Sweet (Tim Matheson), John Davis (David Soul), Donald ""Red"" Astrachan (Kip Niven), and Michael Grimes (Robert Urich), who practice incessantly and are inseparable buddies from their days as Army Rangers. Harry chats with them for a few minutes and even lets Phil Sweet try his .44; he is impressed by Sweet's dexterity with the heavy revolver and with the four young policemen overall.The next day, the mystery motorcycle cop drives out to Tiburon, and the hillside estate of a known gangster who is hosting a swimming party. After parking his bike, he walks up the hill, creeping through the bushes, equipped with a satchel charge and an M76 sub-machine gun. He tosses the satchel charge into the pool to get the attention of the party-goers, who stare up at him, at which point he opens fire - gunning down everyone in attendance. As the bodies lie dead around or even in the pool, the officer walks back to his motorcycle and rides away. Briggs appears later on a broadcast condemning the violence.Harry is watching the newscast at Carol McCoy's house, and she is glad that the ordeal of her divorce is now over; she then asks Harry why he's never hit on her, but her seduction is interrupted by the play of her rambunctious children, then by a phone call to Harry from Early, who is part of a stakeout at a general store where possible robbery suspects have arrived.Harry thus is forced to cut short his dinner date with Carol and drive to the back entrance of the Cost Plus World Market on Taylor Street, where through a two-way mirror in the manager's office, he and a uniformed officer monitor as Early and two checkout associates attend to customers. A man who is at the magazine rack leaves and then returns with three salty-looking dudes who promptly conjure shotguns and pistols. The group's leader punches the store's eldest associate, orders him to find the store safe, and then orders Early to his knees - a fatal mistake, for it gives Harry the opening to shoot him through the mirror. A gun battle erupts. Early shoots one of the robbers out front, the driver gets away, and the last man is shot dead by Harry. After the robbery is stopped, Harry and Early return to headquarters to finish the ensuing paperwork and they pass the four rookie cops, whom Early knows from their days at the police academy.Later that night, we see a prostitute cut in line at the Fairmont Hotel downtown to get a taxicab. When she is about to climb out of the cab at her destination, the pimp (Albert Popwell) she is coming to see suddenly appears out of nowhere and roughly shoves her back into the cab and orders the driver to take off. He finds that she has been holding money from him and warns her that she just had her last chance. Angered, he attacks her and attempts to rape her. The cab driver, seeing the struggle, stops the cab and runs off to call the police. Inside the cab, the pimp pours an entire bottle of drain cleaner into the girl's mouth. As she writhes and convulses, the pimp takes his hat and the emptied bottle with him as he leaves, and we see the prostitute's arm fall out, limp, and dead.Some time later, the pimp is driving across the Golden Gate Bridge when the vigilante motorcycle cop catches up to him and signals for him to pull over. The pimp takes the first exit, makes a left turn through the underpass, and stops on the service road underneath the north approach to the bridge. The pimp, as an extra precaution, hides a revolver under his crotch between his pant legs. The motorcycle cop dismounts his bike and walks up to the car, and claims to have caught the pimp speeding. He asks the pimp for his license and vehicle registration, and the pimp pulls out his wallet, flipping it to show his license, as well as a wad of $100 bills. He fails to notice the cop slowly raising his revolver. The pimp's eyes suddenly widen with horror just as the cop shoots him in the side of the neck. As the pimp writhes in the seat, the cop empties the rest of his bullets into his chest. The cop then re-holsters his revolver, walks back to his motorcycle, and rides off as the pimp bleeds to death.Harry returns home that night where a new neighbor, a young woman named Sunny, greets him; a long-time admirer of his heroism, Sunny offers Harry her own gratitude by asking to bed him. But they are interrupted when Lt. Briggs calls Harry to the city morgue to view the bodies of victims of the vigilante, all of them known criminals, which include the freshly deceased pimp. Harry is reassigned to Homicide by his and Briggs's superior, Captain Avery, but a clue is difficult to come by there are no witnesses to the murders though uniformed patrolmen keep finding the bodies, and ballistics checks of the bullets reveal uselessly generic information about the weapons used.The next day, Harry and Early examine a bullet recovered from the pimp's body that proves to be a .357 Magnum round. Harry and Early also examine the pimp's car at the crime lab, learning from the ballistics expert that the killer emptied an entire magazine into the pimp from point-blank range. When he notices that the pimp was holding out his driver's license and a $100 bill like he was trying to bribe a traffic cop, Harry begins to suspect that the killer of these criminals is someone they'd never suspect. He thus begins to clash with Briggs when Briggs suspects harbor side racketeer Frank Palancio, who had worked with Ricca in the past, may be behind the murders.Harry and Early tail Palancio and harass him as he is driven around the city. But elsewhere, the vigilante cop reaches the top of a penthouse in Pacific Heights, puts a silencer on his revolver, and guns down drug kingpin Lou Guzman and three of his associates (who are being monitored by Harry's friend Frank DiGiorgio and his partner from an office building a block away) with a suppressed Colt Python. As the killer makes his way to the basement, he runs into Charlie McCoy, exiting the utility room. McCoy seems to recognize the killer cop and thinks he is just another fellow officer... until the killer cop raises his revolver and shoots McCoy in the chest. McCoy falls, his helmet falling off, at which point the mystery cop shoots him again in the head, then leaves. Upon seeing DiGiorgio, the cop tells them of McCoy's shooting, then holds back bystander. The killer cop removes his helmet... revealing himself to be Davis.Lt. Briggs chews out Harry for harassing Palancio before revealing McCoy's death. Harry and Davis see Charlie's widow and her kids off for the funeral flight back east, and Harry thanks Davis for showing his support. But Harry harbors suspicions about Davis; when they stumble into a robbery attempt at a bowling alley they subdue the robbers before Davis furiously dresses down bystanders for letting such crimes take place.Later, Davis and Harry compete in a police shooting contest. To prove his suspicions right, Harry borrows Davis's revolver and deliberately misses one target. He recovers it and matches it to the bullets from Charlie McCoy's body. But Harry is reluctant to reveal all he knows when he shows Lt. Briggs a bullet under a forensic microscope, as he now trusts no one.His mistrust proves warranted when a police raid hits Palancio's harbor side offices. Harry has asked for Davis and Sweet to back him up. Palancio and his men are having lunch in the office when they receive an anonymous phone call from an unseen person warning them that they will be attacked in two minutes by hit men disguised as cops. When Sweet knocks on the door, Palancio blasts him from behind the door with a shotgun, and a gun battle ensues. Harry takes out one thug wielding a sub-machine gun before backup arrives. After backup arrives, Davis manages to take out two thugs in the main office single-handedly. As Palancio attempts to flee, Harry clings onto the hood of his car, distracting Palancio, who dies when he takes a wrong turn and is skewered on a crane.When Briggs and Captain Avery try to blame Harry for the debacle, Harry fights back by noting Palancio's men fired first, indicating they were tipped off. Briggs refuses to believe it, vows to ruin Callahan's career, and has Harry hand over the bullet he showed earlier.But the bullet is a fake, as Harry still has the one he found earlier. He now reveals all to Early Smith as he gives him the bullet to give to Briggs if anything happens to Harry. Harry, however, is confronted by the three surviving vigilante cops in the garage of his apartment who make him an offer to join their organization of killing criminals. Harry responds: ""I'm afraid you've misjudged me"". The three vigilante cops then leave.Harry discovers and defuses a bomb in his mailbox apparently left by the vigilantes in case he refused their offer, but a second bomb kills Early. Briggs arrives and asks Callahan to drive to police headquarters with the bomb. But in the car Briggs draws his .357 Magnum Smith & Wesson Model 19 snub nose revolver and forces the inspector to disarm. Briggs reveals himself as the leader of the death squad, cites the traditions of frontier justice and summary executions, and says, ""You're a great cop, Harry... but you'd rather stick with the system."" Callahan responds, ""I hate the goddamn system! But until someone comes along with some changes that make sense, I'll stick with it."" Briggs then instructs Harry to get off at the next exit, and as Harry looks in the rear-view mirror he sees Grimes following them. Instantly Harry knows he's been set up.Harry overpowers Briggs and knocks him unconscious, then dumps Briggs out of the car at a shipyard. He then kills the pursuing Grimes by hitting him head-on with his car. He runs onto an old aircraft carrier as the remaining two vigilante cops arrive. The unarmed Harry evades his pursuers and beats Astrachan to death in one of the abandoned ship's hallways, then takes his motorcycle with Davis in pursuit. After a series of daring jumps on the carrier, the two cyclists run out of deck space; Harry is able to stop, but Davis is unable to stop in time, and rides straight off the carrier deck and into the water, where he drowns. Harry looks down at Davis's body floating in the water and contemptuously says, ""Briggs was right. You guys don't have enough experience"".As Harry stumbles back to his damaged car, Briggs appears again, his .38 snub nose aimed squarely at Harry. The crooked Lieutenant menaces the inspector and threatens to prosecute Harry for killing fellow cops. Harry stealthily activates the timer on the mail bomb as Briggs gets into the car and drives off. The bomb explodes before Briggs has driven 100 feet, killing the corrupt Lieutenant. The final scene of the movie is a close-up of Harry's face as he again says the movie's famous tagline: ""A man's got to know his limitations"", before he walks away."

Appleby adds that his father used to own the Wheelers' house, but now he can only afford to live in the garden flat next door.Later that evening, Ellen and her husband John (Laurence Harvey) dine with Ellen's longtime friend, Sarah Cooke (Billie Whitelaw), who is visiting the Wheelers before going to Scotland to begin a new job. That night, Ellen is wracked by a recurring dream of a car crash that killed her former husband Carl (Kevin Colson) during a rainstorm. Waking in alarm, Ellen goes downstairs as, outside, a thunderstorm rages. When John joins her later and makes concerned inquiries, Ellen asks if they can go away together. Guilty over his long hours as a stockbroker, John evades a direct answer, prompting Ellen to declare that she has lost something in their marriage that she wants back. After John returns upstairs, Ellen stares out the window at an old, abandoned, dilapidated house across the way and, during a lightning flash, screams in horror. Frightened, John rushes to his wife who has collapsed on the floor claiming that she has seen a man with his throat slashed slumped in a chair by the window in the abandoned house.John telephones the police who arrive quickly and search the old house while Ellen, who has been provided with a mild sedative by Sarah, undergoes questioning by Inspector Walker (Bill Dean). Walker's partner, Sergeant Norris (Michael Danvers-Walker) returns later to report that the house is exceedingly run down, but there is no sign of a body. Frustrated and angered by the men's doubt, Ellen insists that she saw a body.The next morning, Ellen views a new row of trees planted by Appleby in his garden and telephones Walker to suggest that the area is the perfect size to cover a body. Meanwhile, unknown to Ellen, Sarah has a rendezvous at a hotel with a man (who is not shown).Later, Walker grudgingly returns to the Wheelers' and questions Appleby, who admits that he planted the trees after the storm, which is an ideal time for planting, but protests the inspector's suggestion that he dig them up. After Walker departs without taking action, Ellen finds a pair of cuff-links and a lighter in her private desk drawer.At his office, John arrives back from his lunch break and after taking a phone call from a client over a latest stock investment, receives a call from Walker who reveals that Ellen has telephoned him numerous times regarding their investigation of the ""murder.""At home that evening, Ellen responds angrily when John recommends that she speak with his physician friend Tony. When John suggests that perhaps it would be best for Ellen to take a trip as she proposed, she reminds him that she wanted them to go away together. Ellen then shows John the cuff-links and lighter, which she says belonged to Carl and which she has not seen in years, and demands to know how they got in her private desk. Offended by her inference that he placed them there, John departs for his local pub for drinks. John meets Sarah on his way out and the two talk quietly, unaware that they are being observed by Ellen.Later that night, Sarah brings Ellen hot cocoa and the women discuss Ellen's frustration that no one will believe her about the body. When Ellen refuses the cocoa, Sarah goes to get her a sleeping pill as Ellen gazes out the window at the old house. Spotting a dim light moving behind the house's ramshackle shutters, Ellen calls Sarah, who confirms seeing the light. Ellen telephones Walker, whose men arrive at the old house as John returns home. Discovering Appleby inside the old house, Walker and Norris take him into custody.The next morning, after digging up the back garden, the police find no body, and are forced to release Appleby without making a charge. Privately, Walker tells John the ""case"" of the murder is officially closed and expresses his hope not to hear from Ellen again. That afternoon, John meets with Tony (Tony Britton), a therapist friend of his, to ask him to see Ellen, but Tony insists that she must be convinced to see him on her own.At the Wheelers' that evening, Sarah admits to seeing her longtime boyfriend Barry, but avoids answering Ellen's question of how Barry will handle her move to Glasgow. When Sarah jokingly says she would rather go somewhere exotic rather than Scotland, Ellen grows distressed. While Sarah and John privately discuss their concern about Ellen in the dining room, they are interrupted by her scream from the living room. There, Ellen declares she has just seen the body of a dead girl in the old house. Dismayed, John telephones Tony. Ellen agrees to speak with him the next day and, during their conversation describes the car accident that killed Carl and his young mistress, whom she never knew. Admitting it was the deepest betrayal of her life, Ellen points out that the unexpected appearance of her former husband's private articles suggests she is purposely being driven into emotional duress. When Tony advises her to leave the house immediately and go to a rest home in Switzerland, Ellen wearily acquiesces. After John refuses to contact Walker, Ellen secretly telephones the inspector to plead for an investigation of the old house. Falsely promising to do so, Walker also suggests Ellen contact the owners and reveals that the house was purchased six months earlier by a private company, named DIPCO.After Ellen has packed for her departure that evening for Switzerland, John presents her with numerous financial papers to sign. Dryly noting the speed with which John had the papers drawn up, Ellen nevertheless signs them then is startled to notice that one of the companies in which the Wheelers own joint shares is DIPCO. When she asks John about the company, John claims not to remember purchasing any stock from it. Sarah joins the couple, and abruptly Ellen declares that she has discovered Sarah is going to Bermuda, not Glasgow after finding a plane ticket while searching though Sarah's purse. Embarrassed, Sarah admits she gave up the job to go to Bermuda with Barry, of whom she believes Ellen does not approve. Unappeased, Ellen shrilly accuses Sarah and John of having an affair, revealing that she has had Sarah followed. Turning on her husband, Ellen shows him one of his keys, which says DIPCO, and insists that he purchased the house to torment her. Both John and Sarah deny they are involved and continue to insists that Ellen is just imagining things. When John refuses Ellen's challenge to test the key on the door of the old house, Ellen runs out into the storm to the decrepit house. Alarmed, John hurries after her as Sarah beseeches him not to go. After some moments, Sarah follows. One of the large knifes from the knife rack in the kitchen is seen missing from its place.In the darkened house, Sarah, John and Ellen roam around the abandoned building looking for each other before Ellen manages to find the second floor room where she claimed to have seen the body. John soon finds her and a struggle ensues in the darkened room. After hearing Ellen scream, Sarah ventures through the maze-like hallways and stairwells of the house where she enters the parlor room on the second floor. Sarah is shocked to find John in a chair facing the window with his throat cut. Moments later, Ellen emerges from the darkness and savagely attacks Sarah, whom she likens to Carl's young mistress years earlier, and brutally kills her too.Sometime later that evening, Ellen contentedly finishes packing, then telephones Walker to plead theatrically with him to investigate the old house after she leaves, as she knows there are two bodies there. Chuckling as she hangs up the receiver, Ellen is startled when Appleby steps out from the next room. Praising her performance with Walker and also her dedication in punishing her unfaithful husband, Appleby assures Ellen that the inspector will not believe him either if he were to report the murders. Smiling, Ellen asks Appleby if he would like to look after his former home in her absence and Appleby happily agrees. She then leaves, while Appleby stands alone in the living room and watches the old house through the window... with John and Sarah's bodies still there... implying that he will bury them in the garden now that the police will not bother coming back to search it again."
tt0070464,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Music']","The film opens with a short fragment outside the plot but clearly related on repeated viewings. Grainy, black-and-white, and silent short, a title ""Once Upon a Time"" leads to Latino laborers picking coffee beans while armed foremen push rudely between them. One worker pockets a few beans (""Coffee for the Breakfast Table"") but is seen by a foreman. He is next seen before a fat Caucasian magistrate who loses some saliva as he removes his cigar only to say ""Guilty."" The foreman pulls his machete and lays it across the unfortunate laborer's wrists, bound to a wooden block, revealing that he is to lose his hands for the theft of a few beans. The machete lifts, descends, and we see the thief draw back in a silent scream. The scene blacks out, the word NOW appears onscreen and expands quickly to fill it.Mick Travis (Malcolm McDowell) is the most promising new sales recruit at Imperial Coffee, a multinational coffee company and distributing factory located somewhere in the UK. His easy manner and winning smile bring him to the attention of the training manager Miss Rowe (Rachel Roberts). When it is learned that a senior salesman in the company has gone missing, Miss Rowe proposes that Mick be recruited to take over his coveted north-east sales sector.After his first successful sale to a large hotel, Mick is invited by the hotel's manager (Arthur Lowe) to attend a private sex club, where Mick makes many valuable contacts, including high ranking government and police figures. On returning to his lodgings, he is contacted by Imperial Coffee and is informed that his sector will be expanded to include all of Scotland, requiring his immediate departure. A tailor (Ralph Richardson) who occupies an adjacent room, gives Mick a suit of golden material as a parting gift. The tailor gives him the following advice: ""Try not to die like a dog.""En route to Scotland, Mick becomes lost and finds himself at the gates of a military facility. He is apprehended by a military detachment and, despite his protestations of innocence, is taken into custody. He is briefly interrogated and tortured by two men in plain clothes (Philip Stone and Michael Bangerter) who apparently believe him to be a foreign spy. To avoid further torture, Mick signs a confession and answers several questions relating to his movements as a spy. When a siren sounds, the two interrogators quickly flee the scene, and Mick is shortly after freed from his restraints by a tea-lady (Dandy Nichols).Mick flees the facility as it gradually engulfed by fire. He makes his way back to his car, which is now also in flames. He retrieves his golden suit from the car shortly before it explodes. Mick makes his way through a blasted and burning landscape. When the clothes he is wearing are ruined by a downpour, he changes into his golden suit. After he has done so, he finds himself in an idyllic pastoral landscape and drinks from a fresh-water stream. He discovers a Christian church where a congregation is singing. Hungry and exhausted, he enters the church and collapses in a pew. When he awakes, the church is empty, but a large quantity of fresh produce has been collected at the altar. He is about to feed himself when he is warned by the vicar's wife (Mary MacLeod) that the food is for God. However, she takes pity on him and feeds him from her own breast.His strength renewed, Mick joyously makes his way back to the road, accompanied by two children. When he reaches the motorway, he decides to head back to London. A car stops for him and asks if he would like to make some quick money by participating in a medical experiment. Mick agrees and is taken to a private clinic run by Professor Millar (Graham Crowden), who performs experimental transplant procedures. Millar informs Mick that his physiognomy is of a rare sort that would be of particular value to their research. Whilst awaiting surgery, Mick sneaks from his room and encounters a post-op patient whose head seems to have been transplanted onto the body of a four-legged animal. On seeing this, Mick flees the clinic in terror.He is next picked up by group of musicians in a van. Inside the van, he discovers a young woman, Patricia (Helen Mirren), hidden under a blanket. He immediately falls in love with her and stays with her on his return to London. Over breakfast, Patricia reveals that her father, Sir James Burgess (Ralph Richardson), is a wealthy copper magnate. Mick decides to insinuate his way into Sir James's company on the pretence that has important information to report on his daughter's welfare. During his interview with Sir James, a disgruntled senior employee (Graham Crowden) commits suicide by jumping from Sir James's office window. Sir James's assistant, in attempting to prevent the suicide, also falls to his death, and Mick is immediately recruited to replace him.Mick's first assignment with Sir James is to attend negotiations with Dr. Munda (Arthur Lowe), president of the African nation of Zingara, who is trying to convince Sir James to establish copper mining operations in his country. As part of the negotiation, Munda requests large quantities of a chemical weapon called ""honey"" to ensure that Sir James's operations will protected from local insurgencies. Mick oversees the delivery of the ""honey"" by the British Air Force to Zingara.A dinner party is held at Sir James's home to finalise the business transaction with Munda. Mick encounters Patricia receiving a marriage proposal by a pathetic English aristocrat (Michael Medwin). Although Mick is incensed, she informs Mick that she may indeed accept the proposal. Sir James offers Munda a large quantity of gold bullion for the right to set up operations in Zingara, but, since the gold must be exported to Zingara illegally, Sir James organises it so that Mick is framed for the crime involved in its delivery. Mick is arrested at the party and brought to court, where he is found guilty and sentenced to five years imprisonment.The prison system in which Mick is incarcerated prides itself on its compassion and its willingness to attend the spiritual and intellectual rehabilitation of its inmates. At the end of his sentence, Mick expresses that he is fully transformed as a human being. Shortly after his release, he encounters a Salvation Army band and offers a large donation from his own limited funds. The band leader (Philip Stone) initially praises Mick's generous spirit, but condemns him when Mick announces that he no longer believes in ""sin"", and that he regards humanity as a united brotherhood. The band and their followers fall to their knees to pray for Mick, who otherwise remains upright and walks away.Mick becomes aware of a disturbance in a nearby neighbourhood. When he investigates, he discovers that a local woman, Mrs. Richards (Rachel Roberts), has barricaded herself in her flat, where she is promising to commit suicide. In an attempt to save her, Mick scales the outside wall of her flat and appeals to her through the window. He assures her that she has every reason in the world to continue living, and he recites various inspirational poetic works to convince her to change her mind. Mrs. Richards, however, remains implacable. Mick falls three storeys to the street below. He is awoken several hours later by a policeman who informs him that Mrs. Richards has completed her suicide.Mick next encounters a mobile soup kitchen. Although he is hungry and destitute himself, he does not accept any food, but rather volunteers to assist the proprietor (Vivian Pickles) in her work. The proprietor eagerly accepts Mick's offer and, giving him a large pot of soup and several paper cups, directs him to distribute it to a community of tramps gathered around a bonfire. As he is distributing the soup, he encounters Patricia, now destitute, cradling an unconscious man in her arms. She recognises Mick and informs him that she accepted the marriage proposal, and indicates that the unconscious figure she is cradling is her husband. The rest of the tramps quickly become hostile towards Mick. They disdain his patronising charity and pelt him with stones.The next morning, Mick encounters a man handing out invitations to an open film audition. Mick attends the audition, where he is singled out by the director (Lindsay Anderson). The director asks him to strike a number of poses for a still photographer. However, when the director asks Mick to smile, Mick asks ""Why?"" and argues that one cannot smile without a reason. The director assaults him in frustration, and Mick struggles to smile with difficulty. Yet, when he finally succeeds in smiling, he is brought to a state of near ecstasy: surrounded by many figures from his own past, happy and reconciled, he dances to upbeat music within a collective brotherhood of humanity."
tt0070468,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","The Offence begins with the police station in a panic, an officer running for help in slow motion, his expression indicating that something terrible has happened. We find Sergeant Johnson (Sean Connery) in an interrogation room, fighting with fellow officers who are attempting to restrain him. He looks around in disbelief, perhaps realizing what he's done, saying ""God, Oh my God.""We then flash back to Johnson and some fellow officers staking out a schoolyard hoping to catch a glimpse of a child abductor/rapist. Johnson walks the area while his other officers wait in a car. He catches suspicious glances from parents waiting outside the fenced in yard to claim their children. They aren't aware that he's a cop, only that a strange man is lurking near the schoolyard. A group of kids walking home is escorted a safe distance away, although one of the girls is shown leaving the group to head towards her own house. Getting in the car with the other officers, Johnson establishes very early that he's frustrated and isn't satisfied with police efforts.One of the girls is abducted nonetheless, a short time after leaving the safety of the group. She is quickly reported missing and a search party is organized. It's Sgt. Johnson who finds the girl in the woods. She screams when he finds her, still in shock, screaming. She's been raped, as suggested by her torn clothes and the mud all over her. Johnson comforts the girl, quieting her down, and wraps her in his coat. He seems to visualize the abductors actions almost putting himself in the criminal's place. He's panicked when the moment is broken by the search party finding them, acting startled for a moment, as if he himself is the rapist. He insists on escorting the girl to the hospital, snapping at Lieutenant Cameron (Peter Bowles) who tells him the girl is not in any state to handle questions. He's furious when a possible witness comes in to file a report, twenty hours late. Officers are directed to search everywhere for the rapist. Other officers later pick up Kenneth Baxter (Ian Bannen) for the crime when they find him covered in mud and scratched up, wandering around town, barely coherent. When Cameron's questioning goes nowhere, they decide they can't charge him. Johnson is somehow 100% certain that Baxter is their man, although Cameron reminds him that ""you can't be certain. Even you can make mistakes."" Johnson gets agitated convinced that Baxter is laughing at them.He takes the opportunity to question the suspect himself (although he is completely unauthorized to do so) Johnson has decided that this man is the culprit and can't bear to think of him going free. Johnson brings Baxter a cup of tea and finds his attitude has become more resistant to questioning. He begins pressuring Baxter, manhandling him and intimidating him in any way that he can. Cameron is directed to charge him or let him go, unaware that Johnson has started his own questioning. Johnson starts hitting Baxter and Baxter, tries to get to another door to escape the room angering Johnson even more. Cutting between the station and the questioning we find Baxter more bloody and beaten each time. The officers respond to screams and we find Johnson called out to sign a statement, then suspended and directed to go home until he's called. Cameron mentions that it's unlikely Baxter will live.Johnson drives home. and his mind starts recalling graphic and bloody images from past cases. We see him in beat cop uniform uncovering a particularly gory murder, which expands to include many other brutal scenes including a man falling from a rooftop and a body hanging from a tree in the woods. At home he heads straight for the liquor and starts drinking. His wife Maureen (Vivien Merchant) wakes up due to the noise he makes. She's initially angry that he's drunk and has broken her China doll. He remarks on seeing her in her bathrobe ""You're a mess! What happened to you? You never used to be such a mess."" He tells her he may have killed a man, and explains that pain was the only thing the man understood. He talks about the girl who is also in the hospital, and when Maureen says ""at least she's alive"" He starts recalling other cases saying ""I've seen them dead too you know."" Maureen reminds him that he's not on his own. He says ""Why aren't you beautiful. You're not even pretty."" She continues attempting to help him, but he says he's always made a point of not talking to her."" ""Who will you talk to then?"" she asks. He starts rambling about the images in his head that he can't stop, going into graphic detail about victims of brutal crimes, his anger building with each detail. Maureen can't take the details and runs off to be sick. Angry that she couldn't listen after offering, he holds her down telling her ""You promised to make me happy and you didn't"" revealing his frayed sanity by implying that Baxter was the person she made happy. Fortunately for Maureen, the outburst is interrupted by the Cameron, who tells him he has to return to the station as Baxter has died in the hospital.  Johnson meets with Lt. Cartwright (Trevor Howard) at the station, who is charged with performing an inquiry into the murder and obtaining the truth. Johnson attempts to describe the interrogation, but is cautioned by Cartwright when he starts describing what was going on in Baxter's mind. Johnson loses his temper several times with Cartwright, which doesn't seem to intimidate him in the least. Cartwright insists that Johnson can't know that Baxter was guilty. Johnson insists that he does know, and recalls his own handling of the girl in the woods to calm her down. ""What's happening to me?"" he asks Cartwright, describing all the disturbing pictures in his mind, revealing that he can vividly see the incident through Baxter's eyes. He grabs Cartwright's arms roughly but Cartwright forces him off and gets him to attempt to recount the scene. Johnson implies that Cartwright can deal with things more easily, because he doesn't get his hands dirty, having subordinate officers find the bodies. Cartwright takes offense reminding him that they've all had to do these things. Johnson keeps visualizing the girl again as is he were Baxter (with his own face) imagining her happy as he approaches in the woods and touches her face. Cartwright concludes that he has what he needs and as he's escorted down the hall, we see a flashback to the full interrogation scene.Johnson asks about Baxter's marriage, complaining that his own wife in bed seems like she's ""doing him a favor"" Baxter explains that in his marriage there are other things that are more important. Baxter then refuses to discuss his wife, threatening to report Johnson and talk to his lawyer. When Baxter stands up offended at a comment. Johnson starts handling him, comparing his handling to how he handled the girls. He makes Baxter very uncomfortable reaching his hands beneath Baxter's jacket in a clearly intrusive way. He tells Baxter that he'll make him feel like the little girls. He strikes Baxter and tells him to get up. Baxter tells him he's mad. Johnson's explanations of Baxter's actions, make it increasingly clear that his own repressed desires are angering him more than what Baxter may have done. Baxter exclaims ""You sad, sorry little man."" prompting Johnson to strike him again. Baxter realizes that Johnson won't let him leave, Baxter starts speaking personally telling Johnson that he's always felt alone. He recounts a bully from high school, and the feeling he got from being bullied, that the bully ""needed him"" saying that this gave him pleasure and the bully never knew that Baxter was ""having him."" Johnson starts laughing hysterically when Johnson segues from the bullying into asking if his father was a big man. When he can't stop laughing Johnson says ""Do you think you're having me?"" Baxter calls him pathetic which prompts another beating. Baxter exclaims ""I know you!"" When Johnson begins thrashing him again Baxter says ""Nothing I've done can be half as bad as the thoughts in your head. I wouldn't have your thoughts."" Johnson calms down momentarily as if he's had a realization while listening to Baxter. Baxter puts on his coat as if to leave, but Johnson asks Baxter to help him with the thoughts in his head, recounting some of them as he squeezes Baxter's hand. He sobs ""Help me."" but tired of having his hand squeezed, Baxter yells ""Help your bloody self!"" which prompts the final beating. Johnson recounts the scene as he waits saying ""He knew. I had to kill him."" We then arrive back at the beginning seeing Johnson fight off his fellow officers and coming to his senses saying ""God, oh my God."""
tt0070509,"['Comedy', 'Drama']","Insecure but entitled midwesterner Hart arrives at Harvard Law School. During the first day of class, legendary professor Kingsfield chides him for being unprepared. Unfortunately for the unsuspecting Kinsgfield, this casual snub inspires an imaginary rivalry in Hart's mind, one which carries us through Hart's first year at Harvard and deep inside the mind of an obsessed student.Hart meets other students and forms a study group. They warn him of the stress of studying law under Kingsfield.Walking home from the store one night, Hart meets a girl named Susan who lives near campus. When she goes inside, he lingers in the shadows, watching her through the windows. He feels a strange and inexplicable attraction to her. Susan's attention inspires him to speak aloud in Kingsfield's class, and this ""success"" arouses his libido. Viewing her as a weapon in his intellectual battle with the professor, he returns to her house, once again gazing uninvited into her windows before making his presence known. She invites him in, and he wakes her in the middle of the night to rave about Kingsfield and the competition in which they are engaged. She tries to comfort him.His relationship with Susan continues until one morning he is late for class and unprepared. Kingsfield calls on him, and moves on to another student when Hart cannot answer the question. In Hart's mind, this routine practice is a grave insult and was directed at him personally because of their deep animus toward one another. Unable to psychologically cope with this perceived loss, Hart takes it out on Susan, blaming her for his failure and for not ""giving him sustenance."" He repeats this strange totemic phrase until he passes out drunk in the park for hours. When he wakes, Susan is gone. He curses her loudly and swears off women, who only distract from his struggle with the professor.Returning home, he finds that Kingsfield has invited all of the students to a Thanksgiving party. At the party, he discovers that Susan is actually Kingsfield's daughter. He yells at her for not telling him of her connection to his enemy. With disgust, he tells her he doesn't even recognize her in dress-clothes. The viewer wonders why she was so secretive, but realizes that probably she did not tell Hart of her connection sooner out of fear that he might kill her and wear her skin like his own, so desperate is he to be closer to Kingsfield. But Susan is a woman with no personal will, so when Hart realizes that he now has the chance to become even closer to the professor, she takes up with him again. He grins lasciviously at her as he tells her she looks like her father. Both admit that Hart is only with her for this connection.Susan resents her father deeply (her mother ended up in a mental institution) and makes love with Hart in her father's bed in order to spite him. Hart goes downstairs into the professor's office to gloat over his conquest, this victory over Kingsfield that Hart has won by defiling the man's daughter. He walks the edges of the office in his boxer shorts, swirling a snifter of brandy and basking in the glory of having bested such an important foe. But as Hart stands nearly nude in the library, Kingsfield returns home. Hart's cowardice causes him to flee without his clothes; this shame fuels his insecurity further.He becomes paranoid, convinced that Kingsfield knows what he did. He tells Susan that Kingsfield is out to get him, that Kingsfield cares about him personally. He implies that Kingsfield watches him. He tells her he is inside Kingsfield's mind, that he is three steps ahead of Kingsfield's own thoughts. Susan tries to convince him that her father does not and cannot care who he is, but Hart cannot relinquish his delusions. Hart feels that every oppressive force on earth originates within the great professor. His relationship with Susan withers, as Hart is completely consumed by thoughts of her father. But Susan discovers Hart hiding in the shadows outside her house; he cannot let go of his only real connection with the professor.He breaks into a library vault to view Kingsfield's notes from his time as a student, to reassure himself that Kingsfield is no better than him. He scoffs at them, but later, lying in bed, begins drawing symbols he saw doodled in the margin of Kingsfield's notes on the walls of his bedroom.Hart begins reading every article or book Kingsfield ever published, trying to use them against Kingsfield in class discussions. Kingsfield mistakes this fixated combativeness for flattery and offers Hart a work assignment, but because of his bizarre obsession and eagerness to both please and defeat Kingsfield, Hart is unable to complete the task on time. Hart takes his failure so hard that he accosts Susan in a grocery store, blaming her and her father for his terrible insomnia and lack of appetite. Susan encourages him to stand up to her father, not understanding what this could mean for them all.In class the next day, Hart once again fumbles when Kingsfield asks him a question. Kingsfield then tells Hart to call his parents to come pick him up, as he will never make it through law school. Hart retorts and calls Kingsfield a son-of-a-bitch, upon which Kingsfield says, ""Mr. Hart, that is the most intelligent thing you have said all morning. You may take your seat"".Hart and a classmate check into a hotel. They are shown surrounded by trash, both in their underpants, muttering about Kingsfield's course. They return to school for exams. After the test, Kingsfield gets onto an elevator alone with Hart. In a pathetic turn, Hart attempts to express to Kingsfield how much he personally means to him, but Kingsfield does not even know Hart's name.When Hart's grades arrive, he gleefully folds the envelope into an airplane and throws it into the ocean, seemingly uncaring of what the envelope signifies."
tt0070510,"['Comedy', 'Drama']","It is the early 1930s, and a small funeral service is underway at the gravesite of Essie May Loggins. In attendance are two female acquaintances and Addie (Tatum O'Neal), the 9-year-old daughter of the deceased. Arriving late for the service is Moses Pray (Ryan O'Neal), a suave-looking younger man. It becomes clear that Essie May was a somewhat ""loose"" woman, and that Moses was one of her lovers. One of the women at the funeral says she notices a resemblance between Moses and Addie, and wonders if Moses is not the girl's father. Moses denies this, but the women persist in questioning him. When they find out that he is heading in the direction of Missouri, they convince Moses to deliver Addie to her aunt and uncle in St. Joseph. Moses is frustrated with this responsibility, but he sees an opportunity in it as well. Moses is a con man, and he uses his own knowledge of Essie May's affairs to blackmail a local man; he takes Addie in to briefly meet the man and then suggests that he may have fathered the child and that Moses could press the issue now that Essie May is dead. Instead of taking responsibility for the child, the man pays Moses $200 to keep quiet, and Moses uses the $200 to buy himself a new car, as well as a train ticket to St. Joseph for Addie. However, Addie is no innocent child. She overhears the conversation that Moses has with his victim, and she refuses to be used in a con game without any compensation: she demands the $200 that Moses acquired, arguing that it's rightfully her money. Moses is furious that Addie is sharp enough to figure out what was going on, and afraid that she might actually blow the whistle on him, he agrees to get her $200 back. After sending a telegram to Addie's relatives saying that she will be delayed, Moses takes Addie with him while he goes to make back her hush money.Addie learns that Moses' hustle is posing as a Bible salesman. He looks in the obituary section of the local newspaper, goes to the homes of men who have recently passed away, and informs their widows that their husbands ordered a Bible with the woman's name printed on the inside. While Moses is talking to a woman named Pearl, Addie finds material in the car with which he printed her name on the inside of the Bible. Touched that her deceased husband intended to buy her a gift, Pearl gives Moses the money for the Bible, and Moses' con is clear to Addie.Moze (as Addie refers to him) is annoyed with having to take Addie along with him on the road, and she reveals herself to be wise beyond her years at every turn. She carries a cigar box with her containing her only possessions in the world, other than her radio. Addie herself thinks that Moze is her father, and she reminds him of this several times, but he denies it consistently. Moze dislikes Addie being involved in his con, but he soon learns that she is an asset when he attempts to hustle a widowed woman into buying a Bible and suddenly a lawman appears in the house, questioning Moze about his business and his identity. Addie saves the day by rushing up to the house and charming the policeman, and she even ups the price of the Bible on the spur of the moment. In another instance, Addie takes pity on a woman who appears at her door surrounded by young children; Addie refuses to allow Moze to take the woman's money and leaves the Bible for her anyway. Moze is angry with Addie for interfering in his affairs, but Addie understands now that she is partners with Moze, and their con turns into profitable business. Moze also teaches Addie different con techniques, such as how to talk sales clerks out of money, and Addie's charm works well for them.Things take a different turn when Moze and Addie visit a traveling carnival and Moze acquires a girlfriend named Trixie Delight (Madeline Kahn). Trixie appears in the carnival as a 'harem girl', and there is a suggestion that she does a little more than just dance for the male patrons. Moze informs Addie that Trixie and her personal maid, Imogene (P.J. Johnson), will be traveling with them from now on, and Addie is furious to have their relationship interrupted by Trixie, who is a loud, obnoxious woman. Addie becomes sullen and ignores Trixie until she has a frank conversation with the girl; Trixie admits that she can never hold onto a man for very long, and that if Addie is patient, Moze will soon tire of her and she will move on.Addie seems to accept this proposition, until Trixie talks Moze into buying a very expensive new car; Addie looks in her cigar box and finds all of their money gone. This is the final straw for Addie, and she immediately plots Trixie's downfall. Enlisting the harried Imogene to help her, the two of them arrange for Trixie to be caught in a compromising position with the desk clerk of the hotel where they are staying. For her part in the scheme, Addie gives Imogene enough money to get back home to her family, and after Moze catches Trixie in bed with the clerk, he immediately collects Addie and abandons Trixie.From here, Addie and Moze seize another opportunity: while staying at a small hotel in a rural area, Addie notices a bootlegger conducting business quietly. His customers approach him and he retrieves their liquor from a small shed in back of the hotel. Addie and Moze get the idea to climb into the shed and steal some of the liquor, then sell it back to the bootlegger. Although their scheme works, they do not know that they have been found out by a man lurking in the shadows nearby. As they leave the hotel in their car, they are pursued by a sheriff who takes them into custody. While at the sheriff's station, Moze and Addie are questioned relentlessly. Although he knows what they did, he cannot prove anything--Addie has hidden the telltale cash they made in her hat. The sheriff intends to keep Addie and Moze locked up until he can pin something on them, so Addie spontaneously comes up with a plan; she steals back the keys to their car and urges Moze to make a break for it. Together they rush outside and make a quick getaway. Pursued by the sheriff and his men, they manage to make it across the border into Missouri, where the sheriff has no jurisdiction and cannot arrest them. Realizing that their car will make them conspicuous, Moze spots a dilapidated old truck outside a farm and rouses the inhabitants of the shabby farmhouse. Making up a reason, he informs them that he needs to swap vehicles and that he will give them the brand new car in an even trade for their broken down truck. The men refuse to trade, saying that the new car is no use to them since it cannot haul anything, so Moze offers to wrestle for it. The men can't resist the challenge and send their best 'wrassler', Leroy (Randy Quaid), to take on Moze. Moze quickly takes the match, however, by playing dirty, and he 'wins' the right to drive off in the beat-up truck.Now that the two of them are in Missouri, the issue comes up about Addie's original destination: her aunt & uncle's house. Moze instead suggests that this is no longer necessary; they will conduct business as usual, as they are partners. Both of them are happy with this decision, as they don't really want to be separated.Moze quickly sets up an opportunity for a very big score involving a wealthy gentleman, and he tells Addie that this will net them enough money to finally get out of the con business. Moze sets out to meet their mark, with Addie to follow later, but he is intercepted by the sheriff from Kansas and his men; while they cannot arrest Moze for his crime in Kansas, they are only interested in revenge, and they chase Moze down and beat him severely. Addie knows something is wrong when Moze is nowhere to be found, and she finds him beaten and bloodied, lying in a stairwell.Now that violence has found him, Moze has a change of heart about having Addie along in this lifestyle; he will take her to live with her aunt and uncle after all. Addie promises that she will not cry about separating from Moze, but when he drops her off at the house, she is less than enthused about living there. Addie's aunt (Rose-Mary Rumbley), is a flighty woman who treats Addie like the child she is, and Addie is put off by her cloying and overly cheerful attitude.Meanwhile, Moze has set off up the road in the broken down truck, which stalls out and leaves him sitting there. He is down on his luck, but even more, he is heartbroken about Addie leaving. Suddenly he looks up into his rear view mirror and sees her, off in the distance, running toward the truck. Although he is glad to see her, he puts on a stern face and stares her down, telling her ""I told you, I don't want you riding with me no more."" Addie is hurt at first, but then she stares back at him and says ""You still owe me $200."" Moze is flustered, and the truck begins to drift away while he isn't looking. Addie shrieks in warning, and they both run after it. Together they climb inside and drive off to a new destination."
tt0070511,"['Biography', 'Crime', 'Drama']","The movie opens with an official explaining the facts of life to a group of prisoners. The scene switches to a French city where a large group of men are being paraded at gunpoint through a street crowded with onlookers, police and media. A wealthy woman waves forlornly to a man wearing glasses. They board a freighter and are put in cells in the ship's hold.The men begin to talk about the short bespectacled man, Dega, who is said to be a renowned counterfeiter, who may have a lot of concealed money. The prisoners begin their voyage and are shown in various daily routines. The blue-eyed man with a large butterfly tattoo, Papillon, has a knife, decides to befriend Dega and promises to protect him. Some men are seen to be getting ill and weak in the heat as the ship travels south. Papillon is tanned, fit, and confident looking. Two men attempt to assault Dega during the night. Papillon manages to fight them off but is placed in irons. Finally the ship arrives at its destination in French Guiana, the men see three small islands in the distance and mention they are high security prisons. One is the real-life but long abandoned Prison of St-Laurent-du-Maroni (Bagne de Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni), where some scenes were filmed.While lining up to disembark one prisoner, Julot, a ""two time loser"", asks for Papillon's shiv and cuts his own knee, he pretends to fall down the gangplank and he is carried off on a stretcher. A young man walks into the ocean and is summarily shot and killed. The prisoners are marched through a town of onlookers, assembled at the main camp, the Pénitencier, and told that if they try to escape they will get two years in solitary, a second attempt means five years solitary confinement, and a third attempt means the guillotine. They are issued red and white striped uniforms. In the barracks an older prisoner/trustee recognizes Dega and explains that an easy job is available for a price. A struggling prisoner is brought in front of the assembled camp and is guillotined. Papillon and Dega stick together, they have a medical exam and just before they are assigned to the easy work a senior guard says Dega's counterfeiting cost his family a lot of money and assigns them to a hard labor logging detail in the swamp.One day a crocodile attacks the group, Papillon and Dega are told to get it with their bare hands. They meet another prisoner, Clusiot, at lunch break who shares some quinine anti-malaria medicine. Next, the prisoners chase butterflies with nets. Dega catches a big blue one. Papillon approaches the butterfly buyer and asks for help to escape. Arrangements are made for two weeks later. Papillon tries to convince Dega to come also. Julot's corpse is brought in with his throat slit, Dega is sickened and causes a commotion, Papillon escapes. Dega gets new bifocal glasses. Papillon comes to the butterfly buyer's camp and is immediately taken at gunpoint, betrayed.He is taken to ""Reclusion"" and told the rules. He is placed in a small cell 5 paces wide and starts walking back and forth and do push ups. His food and water are passed in through a small hatch, despite the poor food he vows to eat all. One day he finds a piece of coconut in his water bucket and a note from Dega. Eventually the guards discover the extra food and try to find out from Papillon who arranged it for him. He refuses to talk and is placed on half-rations. Then his ceiling is covered and he is placed in almost complete darkness. Over time Papillon gets very weak and hallucinates, thinking back on a wasted life, later fantasizing about a triumphant return to France with Dega. He is near death and reduced to eating insects when suddenly he is released as his solitary period is ended. He is taken back to the main camp.Slowly regaining his strength he renews his friendship with Dega, who appreciates that Papillon never gave him up. In the hospital ward he notices a young prisoner, Maturette, who is molested by a trustee. Maturette admits he is homosexual and will help Papillon if he can come too. Papillon starts planning a new escape with the Maturette and Clusiot. A prisoner doctor says he can make suitable arrangements for a price. Dega refuses to go along but gives Papillon money and a map. During a band concert night the three try their escape, a guard is alerted and Clusiot is hurt. Papillon and Maturette get over the wall and encourage Dega to join them. Dega breaks his ankle when falling over the wall.The three escape into the jungle. They paid 3,000 francs to buy a boat but find the boat is useless. A trapper with strange facial tattoos shows them he killed two men who had been waiting for the three escapees. He helps them escape down the river to a leper colony. At the leper colony the leader tests Papillon by telling him to smoke his cigar. Papillon does so and the man says he has non-contagious leprosy. The lepers give the three escapees a boat and some money and the three sail off toward the Honduras.At sea they scavenge water and eat turtles, endure storms and heat. Dega's broken ankle gets worse, Maturette knows some medicine and tries to do first aid . Eventually they land on a sandy beach and are immediately confronted by a small group of Spanish-speaking soldiers. Dega lies there in the sand and the other two scatter. Papillon meets a Spanish prisoner and together they run off deeper into the jungle. The Spanish prisoner is impaled on a booby trap and Papillon is hit with a blowgun dart and falls into a river.He awakes in a village of primitive natives. They live in thatch huts on a beach, fish for pearls and a nubile young woman helps Papillon regain his strength. The chief has Papillon give him a butterfly tattoo like that of Papillon. One day he wakes up and the natives are all gone but have left him a small bag with some pearls. Somewhere he gets newer clothes and appears to be a regular European tourist. At a border crossing he tries to join a religious caravan, they let him join them to cross.

tt0070544,"['Animation', 'SciFi']","The film depicts a future in which human beings, known as ""Oms"" (a word play on the French-language word hommes, meaning men), have been brought by the giant Draags to the Draags' home planet, where they are kept as pets (with collars). The Draags are an alien race which is humanoid in shape but a hundred times larger than humans, with blue skin, fan-like earlobes and huge, protruding red eyes. The Draags also live much longer than human beings one Draag week equals a human year. Some Oms are domesticated as pets, but others run wild, and are periodically exterminated. The Draags' treatment of the Oms is ironically contrasted with their high level of technological and spiritual development.The story opens with a woman running, occasionally looking behind her as if pursued. An enormous hand descends and blocks her way. She runs back the way she came and finds her way blocked by another hand. It becomes apparent that she is being toyed with by entities that do not appreciate her fragility, and as she dies, the infant she has been carrying and attempting to protect begins to cry.The view changes to reveal the Draag children who have accidentally killed the woman; they leave quickly when an adult Draag and child approach. The child voices concern for the orphaned infant, and the two take the child to their home. Tiva (the Draag child) names the infant Terr (word play on ""terrible"", same spelling in French; also a homophone for the French ""Terre"", meaning Earth). Her father, whom the adult Terr voice-over explains is master Sinh, the Draag great Aedile, attaches a collar capable of physically dragging Terr back from mischief, and over the next several scenes, their relationships develop.Terr witnesses the parents seemingly ingesting food by inhaling it from a device. After changing Terr's costume as one would a doll's, Tiva uses makeup to give herself a more Om-like appearance. When Terr impishly trades dark pigment for light, Tiva blows some of the powder on him. Tiva uses a tiny indoor weather-maker to cause a small storm cloud to form over Terr and chase him around the dwelling. Tiva takes Terr for a walk, and then teaches him how, under certain circumstances, crystals will form on stationary objects, including standing bipeds. She also teaches him that whistling will shatter the crystals. Terr happens upon master Sinh as he and several compatriots are melding in a ritual, and it is revealed that many Draag children have Oms like Terr when they convene to watch their respective Oms interact.Tiva's education is supplied by the use of a headset that transmits knowledge directly into the brain of the user. Because she enjoys having Terr in her hand when she is having her ""infos,"" Terr begins to acquire their knowledge.Meanwhile, at the seat of government, Draag Councilors discuss whether the regular extermination of the wild Oms is sufficient to keep their numbers at an acceptable level. It is revealed that Oms were first found on a planet that retained some evidence of structured life, but the images seem to reveal that Earth was in a post-apocalyptic state at the time.Terr decides to escape, and to take the headset with him. He does not get very far before Tiva realizes he is missing, and her mother tells her to use her bracelet to bring him back. Terr finds himself suddenly being dragged backward by the collar. Only the headset becoming entangled in plants allows a wild female Om to come to his rescue before he is choked by the collar or dragged all the way back.When Terr explains that the headset contains the knowledge of the Draags but he doesn't know where to go with it, his unnamed rescuer takes him to her tribe, who live in a tree in a walled park. When it is demonstrated that Terr can read Draag script, the leader (known only as ""Mighty One"") is willing to accept Terr into the tribe, but the Wizard is not, and demands a trial by combat to the death. Terr and the Wizard's champion have child-sized animals bound to their torsos in such a way as to prevent the combatants from using anything but the beaks of said animals to attack. Terr is injured, but wins the trial.Over the next several scenes, it is shown how the Oms have adapted to life on the Draags' planet. Snail-like animals weave clothes onto the Oms, predators that would eat Oms are in turn hunted and efficiently stripped of useful materials, and the gene pool is kept well-mixed. Oms even make the occasional foray into Draag areas in search of resources. Returning from one such expedition, the group of adventurers is accosted by ""bandits"" who drop clawlike harpoons into the cargo and simply lift it up into their own tree. Mighty One tells Terr that they live on the other side of the park, and cautions him that they are evil.When the now-literate Oms read the new sign on one of the walls, they realize the park is about to be ""de-Omised."" Terr decides that he must take this information to the tribe of ""bandits,"" and is quickly captured and taken before their leader, a wizened old woman.The woman is skeptical of Terr's claims. Terr is tied up and left. But when the de-Omising begins, the old woman returns and frees him. The de-Omising is accomplished using disks that release a poison gas. A great many Oms perish to this gas, but a sizable number still manage to escape through a crack in the park wall.Two passing Draags witness the exodus, and one begins crushing the Oms underfoot. The Oms retaliate and manage to bring down one of their attackers, but Mighty One is also killed, and the old woman leads the survivors to a place where she believes they will be safe. The death of a Draag puts the Council in an uproar. De-Omising is stepped up to a much higher priority, new technologies are developed, and frequency is scheduled to increase.The old woman has led the two now-united tribes to an old rocket depot. Applying their newfound knowledge, the Oms, seemingly under Terr's direction, very quickly adapt the abandoned technologies to their own purposes and begin to flourish, thanks to the rebirth of mechanized industry. On a visit to the old woman, Terr's former rescuer hears her express both optimism and regret that she will not live to see the Oms finally find peace.Fatalities resulting from Draag attempts to de-Om the rocket depot are minimized by the creation and organized use of shelters, but the Draags' updated de-Omising technologies become ever more aggressive, and when an automated scout detects the persistent Om settlement, it summons an array of lethal devices.As the attacks become more diverse and effective, the Oms launch their manned rockets toward the Fantastic Planet, where they discover headless statues. As bubbles descend to alight atop the statues, the statues begin to dance. Each bubble seems to contain an image of an individual Draag in meditation; their ""spirits"" are what animate the statues.It turns out that the statues facilitate ""nuptial rites"" between the Draags and entities from other galaxies, and from these, the Draags draw their life force. When the feet of the dancing statues threaten the rockets, the Oms use energy weapons that shatter the statues. Pandemonium reigns supreme in the Council chamber, for it seems the two races will destroy one another if they cannot find a way to live together.But in the very next scene, an Om steps down off an outstretched Draag hand, removes his silly hat and assumes a posture of confidence and self-assertion. The headset voice dispassionately recounts the Oms' construction of a new satellite where they can live, ""which they call Terr, after their ancestral planet ."""

tt0070666,"['Biography', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","Frank Serpico (Al Pacino) covered in blood and slumped in the backseat of a police car as it races to a hospital with lights and sirens blaring. He has just been shot in the face. The rest of the movie tells the story of Serpico's career up to this moment, starting with him becoming a police officer in 1960. He is very idealistic and believes in non-brutal methods to catch criminals. Serpico also refuses to join in on police corruption, specifically that which involves shaking down and taking payoffs from gambling and drug dealing organizations. His refusal to take bribes earns him the suspicion of his fellow officers throughout the majority of the precincts to which he is assigned. Additionally, Serpico finds trouble fitting in due to his embrace of the counterculture of the 1960s: He moves to Greenwich Village, grows his hair and beard long to the point where he must maintain a plainclothes appearance, and associates with a more left-wing crowd that is distrusting of the NYPD.At first Serpico tries appealing to his bosses about the corruption, but gets nowhere. He enlists a highly-connected fellow officer, Bob Blair (Tony Roberts) in his fight against corruption, but not even he can crack the city administration's general indifference. His campaign and the resulting complications and harassment within the department take a toll on his mental health and his relationship with fiancee Laurie (Barbara Eda-Young), who ultimately leaves him. After meeting a sympathetic police inspector who agrees to assist him with both disrupting the gambling rackets and later calling attention to the problem by going to the New York Times, he is transferred to narcotics, as he has always wanted. However, he finds himself in an even more corrupt and hostile atmosphere than before, where he has mostly enemies and almost no allies due to the reputation he has garnered. As a result, he is shot in the face during a raid on a heroin lab due to his fellow officers' reluctance to come to his aid. After being left for dead and eventually discovered by two uniformed officers, the story takes over from the beginning and shows a recuperating Serpico being tended to by his family and few remaining friends as well as being anonymously harassed with hate mail.At the end of the film, Serpico testifies to the Knapp Commission on police corruption. The film ends with him waiting to board a ship; despite being promoted to detective (a lifelong ambition of his) and being decorated by the department for ""conspicuous bravery in action"" (along with the two officers who abandoned him during the drug raid) he resigns from the NYPD and emigrates to Switzerland."
tt0070672,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery']","New York City circa 1973. A business type enters an antique store as a heavily bearded type is shown upstairs by one of the store's owners. A burly deliveryman with a glass water cooler bottle enters and trips over the businessman, smashing up several antiques. A loud argument ensues and uniformed police must intervene - until a painter breaks into the office upstairs and returns with a box wrapped in grocery paper - and containing large wads of counterfeit money.Thus has The Seven-Ups - a special unit led by Buddy Manucci (Roy Scheider) and including Officers Ansel (Ken Kercheval) (the phony painter), Barelli (Victor Arnold), and Mingo (Jerry Leon) (the phony deliveryman) - broken up another area of criminal activity. But their unorthodox methods upset Lt. Jerry Hanes (Robert Burr), who has confronted the team's commanding officer Inspector Gilson (Rex Everett) before about their methods only for Gilson to fully stand up for his men. The controversy upsets Manucci, though he is reassured by his CO's endorsement.Presently the team is gathering information on a crooked bail bondsman, Festa (Matt Russo), as his name has turned up on a wiretap. Buddy consults one of his Mob informants, funeral parlor owner Vito Lucia (Tony Lo Blanco), who presently does not have any new information to give.Later mobster Max Kalish (Larry Haines) is arrested at his plush mansion by two FBI agents - but they are not FBI agents as they corner Kalish, punch him out, then demand a hefty ransom from Kalish's lawyer. The lawyer and a mob errand boy drive to a car wash where the phony G-men lock the car's doors and steal the ransom; they later dump Kalish in a vacant lot and drive off, and at a museum Moon (Richard Lynch), the longish-haired younger of the two kidnappers, meets his connection where money changes hands for the successful kidnapping.While walking through his old neighborhood Buddy is summoned by a barber, who tells him of disturbing activity within the area's mafia gang. Buddy and Ansel then become more concerned when they are tailing Festa and he is grabbed by two men (the same gunmen who grabbed Kalish) who portray themselves as members of the District Atorney's office. Buddy and the team then stake out Vito's funeral parlor, where Kalish and other criminals are meeting to decide what to do next; the kidnappers of Festa have already collected several hefty ransoms and want another for Festa, to be exchanged at the same car wash. The mobsters' anxiety shows when a bodyguard starts to whip out a revolver on Vito when he appears. Ansel has infiltrated the ranks of mobsters' limo drivers wearing a wire - but while Buddy and the others are momentarily distracted one of the bodyguards notices the wire. Ansel is taken inside, beaten, and his cover blown.Kalish, thinking the kidnappers are cops, ties up and gags Ansel and stuff him into the trunk of his fellow criminal Carmine Coltello (Lou Polan), who will drive to the car wash with a tail of gunmen to deal with the kidnappers. When Mingo sees Ansel is not among the limo drivers, Buddy and Borelli jump in their car and follow Coltello to the car wash. Once there, with the mobsters on one side thinking they will catch the kidnappers there, Coltello instead is jumped just outside the other side of the car wash and driven into a next door parking garage. Buddy and Borelli try to get into the place, but only after hearing gunfire - the result when the kidnappers Moon and his driver Bo think it's a setup and gun down Coltello, then blast open the trunk of his car, and are shocked to find a now-dead policeman inside - do they succeed in entering the garage. They arrest the garage worker, Toredano (Joe Spinell) before discovering Ansel's body.The gunmen then make a break for it and Buddy jumps into his car and a violent high-speed pursuit ensues through the streets of New York City before blasting through a police roadblock onto a mammoth bridge then spilling onto a country highway. Buddy finally catches up to the gunmen but his rammed into the underside of a stricken eighteen-wheeler, and narrowly avoids being decapitated by the truck's rear bumper.Escaping major injury, Buddy goes with Borelli to the hospital where Coltello is being treated for critical injuries and the body of Ansel has been posted. Buddy is then interrogated by Gilson and Hanes and it is here he learns of the kidnapping of mafia types - and that the Chief Of Detectives (at present involved in a stormy snap press conference with reporters naturally confused and suspicious about the whole matter) believes it to be The Seven-Ups' work.Vito, meanwhile, is shaken badly by the disastrous turnabout in the Coltello incident, and he confronts Moon telling him to release Festa and lay low. Moon, though, wants none of it, vowing to kill Manucci if he comes calling.Despite Gilson's orders, Buddy, Barilli and Mingo question Toredano on their own, but, having been physically grilled by the police before to no avail, Toredano provides no information. Frustrated by Toredano's silence, Buddy returns to the hospital where he threatens to remove Coltello's oxygen unless he reveals who shot Ansel. Although surprised when Coltello manages to mutter Kalish's name, Buddy and the others go to Kalish's house and at gunpoint demand an explanation. When Kalish details the ransom kidnappings and mentions his circle of mob colleagues who have been affected, Buddy writes down their names. Later at a diner he compares the list to that of the mob bosses Vito has informed upon and suddenly realizes the connection.Later that night, Buddy summons an anxious Vito for a meeting and asks for information on Toredano. The next morning, Buddy, Barilli and Mingo arrive at Toredano's dilapidated house. After locking Toredano in the cupboard, Buddy waits inside while Barilli and Mingo hide outside. Soon, Moon and Bo arrive, but Bo spots Barilli and the men shoot each other. Alerted, Moon races away with Buddy in pursuit as Mingo looks after the wounded Barilli. After a chase on foot, Buddy confronts and kills Moon.That afternoon, Buddy meets Vito and reveals he knows about his betrayal. Insisting that he never did anything to hurt Buddy directly, Vito refuses to accept responsibility for Ansel's death, declaring he had to get money to support his wife and children. Disgusted, Buddy assures Vito he will not arrest him, but will make sure the mob bosses know Vito was behind the kidnappings.

She takes the big knife from the cutlery set and offers it to Danielle to cut up the birthday cake. However, she uses the knife to viciously kill him.

Emil laves and takes the bloodied knife away. When Detective Kelly and Grace appear, there is not a stain in sight. Danielle is kind, and the only remains of the corpse is a red stain on the back of the fouton where Grace is sitting down. Danielle justifies the double sets of matching clothes due to her job as model, because if one of them gets stained, they would have a completely equal outfit available. Grace finds the cake in the fridge. Also, Danielle had said that she lives on her own, and that's the opportunity for Grace to prove that she is lying. However, Grace falls down and smashes the cake against detective Kelly's leg. Emil appears, saying that they are separating but that they are not still divorced.Detective Kelly tells Grace not to disturb him or Danielle again with that matter.

When they arrive to the bakery, she jumps to ask the shop assistants (Olympia Dukakis and Justine Johnston), but the only thing that she learns is that there was a black man who had bought that particular cake dedicated to Danielle and Dominique on their birthdays.Grace hires a private detective called Joseph Larch (Charles Durning), who says that the only possibility of hiding a body is within the sofa. Grace tells him that he has found the Blanchion Siamese twins, but the detective says that he didn't see any twins, he has only found a place in which a human body could be hidden without the police finding it.Grace talks to a doctor, Arthur McLennen (Barnard Hughes) who studied the case of the Blanchion Siamese twins, the first set of twins of Canadian origin. Dr Pierre Milius - Emil's younger persona - appears on a news report talking about the delicate psychological mental equilibrium of one of them. As teenagers, Danielle is shy, but Dominique is more talkative and shows off more.

Borrowing their host's inflatable hydrovac suit, Luna convinces Miles to wear it as a disguise, then drives to a deserted road near a river where she inflates the suit in order to disable Miles as the police approach. As Miles bounces away, the police seize Luna and, due to her exposure to the ""alien"", are about to kill her. Just then, Miles pounces them from behind. Running to the river, Luna climbs onto the buoyant Miles, paddling until the police fire a shot into his suit, propelling them to the other side. There, Miles finds an abandoned 20th century era Volkswagon, which starts immediately. As they drive away, Luna asks what it is like to be dead for 200 years, to which Miles replies it is ""like a weekend in Beverly Hills"". Luna doesn't understand.Miles and Luna take refuge in Dr. Melik's deserted house where Luna suggests they use the orgasmatron, but Miles tries to win her over to more primitive ways of making love. Interrupted by the police, Miles gives Luna Dr. Melik's gun, telling her to hide until he can lead them to the western district where they will find out about the Aries Project. Miles is hiding in the orgasmatron when the police find him disheveled and grinning like a zombie. They lead him away, then later, he wakes up in a drawer and is informed that he will be initiated into a society that will completely take care of his needs and desires. After being reprogrammed, fitted with new clothes and moved into a new apartment, complete with a robot dog named Rags, Miles is soon working at a new job and dating a pretty co-worker.Now living alone in the woods, Luna is captured by handsome, blond Erno Windt , a leader with the underground, and becomes a revolutionary. After dinner at McDonalds one night, Miles is surprised at home by Luna, whom he does not remember and, horrified to learn that she is with the underground, he calls for Rags to attack as Erno jumps out of the orgasmatron. Captured and taken to the woods, Miles is reprogrammed again. After regaining his original personality and memory, Miles is attracted to Luna, but sadly realizes she is involved with Erno. Agreeing to help with Erno's plan for Aries Day, Miles and Luna infiltrate a medical facility disguised as doctors, and as Miles jealously bickers with Luna over her feelings for Erno, they are surprised by a team of physicians who mistake them for expected guests.Entering a top- secret meeting, they all learn that an assassin's bomb has destroyed The Leader, except for his nose, which now must be cloned. Miles and Luna determine to create a diversion and steal the nose, but instead, find themselves in an operating theater with the doctors ready to observe them performing the procedure. After stalling as long as they can, Miles hides the nose under his surgical mask, but it is quickly discovered. Miles holds the nose hostage with Dr. Melik's gun while he and Luna run off, then ultimately throws it under a steamroller where it is flattened, to the horror of the doctors and police.Having successfully escaped, Luna ecstatically proclaims that Erno's revolution will soon triumph, but Miles retorts that political solutions never work, adding that in six months, someone will be stealing Erno's nose. Agreeing that they love each other, Luna ruefully informs Miles that science has proven meaningful relationships cannot last. When Miles refutes the theory, she observes that he does not believe in science, political systems or God and asks what he does believe in. Miles answers that he believes in sex and death, two things that come once in a lifetime, but after death one is not nauseous. Finally, Miles and Luna kiss."

tt0070723,"['Crime', 'Mystery', 'SciFi', 'Thriller']","In the year 2022, the population has grown to 40 million people in New York City alone. Most housing is dilapidated and overcrowded, and the homeless fill the streets and line the fire escapes, stairways of buildings, abandoned cars, subway platforms, etc. Unemployment is at around 50%. Summers are oppressively hot and humid with temperatures over 90F degrees during the day and night due to Earth's recent climate change resulting from the Greenhouse Effect. Food, as we know it in this present time, is a rare and expensive commodity. Most of the World's population survives on processed rations produced by the massive Soylent Corporation, including Soylent Red and Soylent Yellow, which are advertised as ""high-energy vegetable concentrates"". The newest product is Soylent Green: small green wafers which are advertised as being produced from ""high-energy plankton"". It is much more nutritious and palatable than the red and yellow varieties but, like most other foods, in short supply which often leads to weekly food riots.Robert Thorn (Charlton Heston) is a New York City Police Department detective from the 14th Precinct who lives in a dilapidated, cramped one-room apartment with his aged friend and roommate, Solomon ""Sol"" Roth (Edward G. Robinson, in his last film). Roth is a former college professor whose job is to sort through the now-disordered remnants of written records and books to help Thorn's investigations. Roth and his like are known as ""books."" He tells Thorn about the time before the ecological disaster and population crisis of the early 2000s, when real food was plentiful, although Thorn is generally not interested in the stories, finding most of them too hard to believe.Thorn is assigned to investigate the murder of William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotten), a 68-year-old wealthy lawyer living in a luxury high-rise apartment building called Chelsea Towers West. At the crime scene, Thorn first talks with the building superintendent Charles (Philip Stone) about discovering the body. Charles leads Thorn to the 22nd floor and to Simonson's apartment which is 22A. Thorn finds Simonson lying in a pool of blood after having been struck multiple times in the back of the head with a sharp object which is speculated to be a meat hook or an ax. Instead of looking for clues, the poorly paid detective helps himself to the wealthy man's food, liquor and books and even enjoys taking a shower (with real hot water and soap). He questions Shirl (Leigh Taylor-Young), an attractive 23-year-old ""concubine"" (euphemistically known as ""furniture"") who comes with the apartment, and Simonson's bodyguard, Tab Fielding (Chuck Connors), who claims that he was told to escort Shirl on a shopping trip when the attack took place. The sanitation crew led by Wagner arrives to take Simonson's dead body away, as Thorn leaves after collecting a statement from Fielding.Returning to his apartment, Thorn gives Roth the Soylent Oceanographic Survey Report, 2015 to 2019, a two-volume work which he took from Simonson's apartment. Thorn returns to work at the 14th Precinct during that evening where they're hundreds of people lining up to collect death benefit money from recently diseased friends and family members. Thorn talks to his superior officer, Lieutenant Hatcher (Brock Peters), telling him that he suspects it may have been an assassination, since nothing was stolen from the apartment and the murder seemed professional. Thorn also finds it odd that the luxury apartment's sophisticated alarm and monitoring electronics, including the building's security cameras, happened to be inoperative on the night of the murder, and his bodyguard just happened to be out of the apartment at the time. Thorn confides in Lt. Hatcher that he suspects that Fielding might have had something to do with Simonson's murder.The next day, Thorn stakes out Fielding's apartment building and sees him leave. Thorn lets himself into Fielding's apartment where he questions Fielding's live-in ""furniture"", Martha (Paula Kelly), about his work for Simonson. Thorn returns to his own apartment to eat an evening meal of the purloined food taken from Simonson's apartment that Roth prepares for them. Afterwards, Roth tells Thorn about the research he did on the murder victim and that Simonson was a member of the board of directors of the Soylent Corporation. When he presents Roth with a spoon of strawberry jam surreptitiously palmed from Fielding's apartment, Roth tastes it and declares that Fielding's ""furniture"" is eating some ""$150-a-jar"" strawberry jam, which is an out-of-place luxury for the mistress of a bodyguard.That evening, Thorn returns to the Chelsea Towers West to question Shirl, who tells him that Simonson became deeply troubled in the days before his death, even taking her to church. Shirl is throwing a party in Simonson's vacant apartment for the other ""furniture"" girls of the building. Just then, Charles arrives and begins yelling and hitting the women for slacking off until Thorn arrives back in the living room to stop Charles from hurting the girls anymore. After sending Charles and the rest of the furniture girls away, Thorn returns to Shirl and they make love.A little later that same evening, Thorn goes to a local Catholic Church (teeming with hundreds of homeless people) and attempts to question the priest (Lincoln Kirkpatrick) about Simonson's confession, but the priest is almost catatonic with exhaustion and has a hard time remembering Simonson, even though Simonson, as a rich man, would have stood out among the impoverished people who normally frequent the church. When the priest remembers Simonson, he tells Thorn the memory of what Simonson told him was haunting him, and is unable to describe what Simonson said to him because it was ""too horrible"". The next day, Fielding goes to the church and murders the priest to ensure he never talks again.The next morning, as Thorn begins uncovering more evidence as to why Simonson was murdered, New York State's Governor, Joseph Santini (Whit Bissell), who was once Simonson's partner in a high-profile law firm and who is running for re-election (as shown in the campaign posters on such walls as that of Hatcher's office), instructs Hatcher to close the investigation. However, Thorn continues his investigation into the murder. When Governor Santini learns that Thorn refuses to close the case of the Simonson murder, he orders his chief of security, Donovan (Roy Jensen), to have Thorn murdered.When Thorn is on riot duty during the Tuesday distribution of Soylent Green rations, Simonson's murderer, Gilbert (Stephen Young), a local assassin-for-hire whom was the one that Donovan contracted to murder Simonson, attacks Thorn and fires several shots at him with a silenced pistol as a food riot begins. Thorn chases his attacker into the thick crowd as large dump trucks called ""scoops"" designed by the NYC Riot Police, arrive to pick up closely packed rioters and ""scoop"" them into the trucks. But before Thorn can capture Gilbert, who manages to wound Thorn by shooting him in his right calf, the assassin is crushed to death under the ""scoop"" of one of the riot control vehicles.Thorn goes back to Fielding's apartment and beats him and his mistress Martha for the attempt on his life. Thorn then goes back to Shirl at Simonson's apartment where she removes the bullet and stitches his wound. Shirl tells Thorn that a new tenant will be arriving soon at the apartment and is hoping to move in, but she has romantic feelings for Thorn. Thorn tells Shirl that he will let her know if she wants to stay with him or the new tenant of Simonson's apartment. After resting for about an hour, Thorn leaves the apartment into the evening as sirens for the nightly curfew begin sounding. Sometime later a new potential tenant, a brash high-class businessman, arrives at the apartment and questions Shirl about herself and describes his daily details should he decide move in and want to keep her as ""furniture"".Meanwhile, Roth examines Soylent's oceanographic reports at the Supreme Exchange, a library and gathering place for fellow ""books."" The ""books"" and Roth finally realize that the reports indicate a ""horrible"" truth which, despite reading it for themselves, they find nearly impossible to believe; Soylent Green isn't made from plankton, it's made from human bodies. Unable to live with what he has uncovered, Roth opts for assisted suicide at a government clinic (in the former Madison Square Garden, which had been converted to a clinic for mass euthanasia), a process referred to as ""going home"". As Roth is dying, he watches video clips of Earth long ago when animal (sheep, deer, and horses) and plant life was thriving and there was no pollution, while listening to light classical music.Thorn returns to his apartment and finds a note from Roth that he is ""going home"". Thorn races to the clinic and forces one staff attendant (Dick Van Patten) to allow him to see and talk to Roth. During Roth's final moments, he tells Thorn the secret of Soylent Green, and begs him to follow his body to the processing center, and report back to the ""Supreme Exchange"".Thorn sneaks into the basement of the assisted suicide facility, where he sees corpses being loaded onto waste disposal trucks. He secretly hitches a ride on one, which is driven to a heavily guarded waste disposal plant just outside the city. The black-clad sanitation drivers are escorted at gunpoint out of the truck where a white-clad plant worker takes over driving. The sanitation worker is escorted to another truck leaving the fortress-like facility to drive back to the city. Once inside the plant, Thorn sees how the corpses are processed into Soylent Green wafers. They are loaded onto a conveyor belt and driven through a large machine about several hundred yards long, and the Soylent Green wafers come out on the other end. But Thorn is spotted by two plant workers and is chased. Thorn kills one and subdues another before he escapes from the plant just when the alarm is sounded.Thorn returns to the teeming city and heads for the Supreme Exchange to report what he found, but is ambushed by Fielding and three other gunmen (all of whom presumably work for the government and are also aware and are trying to conceal the secret about Soylent Green). Thorn manage to get to a police payphone and call Shirl to tell her that he loves her and to stay with the new tenant whom wants to rent Simonson's vacant apartment. Thorn also manages to place a second call to Lt. Hatcher at the 14th Precinct to tell him where he is and that he is being attacked, but then gets cut off when the assassins close in.During a chase through the deserted streets and alleys (cleared of people because of the government-imposed dusk to dawn curfew), Thorn manages to kill all the gunmen chasing him except for Fielding who shoots Thorn in the back. He retreats into a cathedral filled with homeless people and Fielding follows him. After a desperate fight through throngs of sleeping homeless, Thorn kills Fielding by stabbing him with a rusted kitchen knife.When police backup arrives at the church, the seriously wounded and nearly hysterical Thorn confides to Lt. Hatcher the horrible secret behind Soylent Green, while Hatcher looks on with disbelief. As Thorn is being carried away by the police on a stretcher to a local hospital, he urges to Hatcher to spread the word and shouts out to the spectators: ""Soylent Green is PEOPLE!! We've got to stop them... SOMEHOW!!!"""
tt0070735,"['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Drama']","It is 1936 and a money runner is carrying the week's take -- $11,000 -- from an illegal gambling outfit in Joliet, Illinois, to the main office. On the way, three men con him by replacing his money with tissue paper. Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw), the mobster who was supposed to get the money, exacts revenge by having one of the con men, Luther Coleman (Robert Earl Jones), killed when his men push him out a window. Lonnegan also orders a hit on Luther's partner, Johnny Hooker (Robert Redford). Hooker goes to Chicago to escape Lonnegan's wrath. In Chicago he meets Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman), an old friend of Luther's. Out for revenge for Luther's death, they set up an elaborate plan -- a ""long con"" -- to swindle an enormous sum out of Lonnegan so neatly that he won't even realize he's been conned.Posing as an obnoxious gambling boss from Chicago, Gondorff gets into a high-stakes poker game with Lonnegan, who is known to cheat. Lonnegan, flustered by the first round of play, orders one of his men to replace the deck with one stacked with threes and sixes, his preferred hand. Despite the stacked deck, Gondorff cheats better and wins $15,000 from Lonnegan. Lonnegan can't pay it right away because his wallet is missing. (One of Gondorff's associates picked his pocket before the game.) Gondorff sends Hooker to Lonnegan's cabin to pick up the money. Hooker, playing Gondorff's resentful second-in-command, tells Lonnegan he has a great plan to con Gondorff, but he needs ""someone respectable"" to place the bets. Lonnegan, furious at being out-cheated, bites.Gondorff and company do a lot of fast work to get ready for the final phase of the long con. First they assemble a mob and rent an empty basement, transforming it in a couple of days into a prosperous gambling parlor. An announcer (Ray Walston) in a back room describes horse races as if they were happening live -- but he's reading from a ticker tape, so the results are known in advance. They choose a race with odds they like -- maybe 3:1 or 4:1 -- and call in a tip (a particular horse or horses to win, place, or show) to the pay phone at the corner drugstore, where Lonnegan is waiting. Gondorff's gang has also rented a room with a view of the corner drugstore; when Lonnegan comes out on his way to the gambling den, a watcher rings a buzzer to warn them he's coming. They run through this once with a fairly small bet to show Lonnegan the system will work; the final plan they give Lonnegan calls for a bet so large it will ruin Gondorff. They run into trouble when Lonnegan demands to meet Hooker's imaginary accomplice. Hooker has told Lonnegan the key to the scam is his friend at Western Union who gives him race results by phone before they're released over the wire. The skeptical Lonnegan, however, wants proof. Pretending to be painters, the gang tricks a genuine Western Union manager into vacating his office for an hour, and one of them poses as the manager. Lonnegan is convinced.Meanwhile, Lonnegan's goons have tracked Hooker to Chicago but failed to kill him. (They -- and Lonnegan -- have no idea that the man Lonnegan is ""helping"" to con Gondorff is the same guy who helped Luther take the runner's money at the beginning of the movie.) Lonnegan assigns the job to someone called Solino, who, it's implied, is a very skilled assassin.Lt. Snyder (Charles Durning), a Joliet cop, has pursued Hooker to the big city because Hooker gave Snyder counterfeit cash when Snyder tried to shake him down. Snyder isn't getting very far; when Hooker can't stay out of Snyder's way entirely, he can outrun him. Snyder is induced to assist FBI Agent Polk (Dana Elcar), who's after Gondorff. Snyder collars Hooker and brings him to Polk, who pressures him to give up Gondorff by threatening to lock up Luther's wife. Hooker, who was close to Luther's family, gives in, provided the FBI will let the Lonnegan con run its course before arresting Gondorff.The night before the final act of the con, Hooker hooks up with Loretta (Dimitra Arliss), the new waitress at the diner where he likes to eat. When he wakes up, she's gone. He's somewhat puzzled to find that she hasn't robbed him. He dresses, fits something we don't get a good look at over his back teeth, and goes out. A man whom we've seen only glimpses of before now is stalking Hooker with a gun. As Hooker walks down a sunlit alley and spots Loretta coming toward him, smiling, the armed man emerges behind him and shoots -- hitting Loretta neatly in the middle of the forehead. She drops a handgun as she falls. Hooker, stunned, listens to the gunman's explanation that Loretta Solino is ""a pro"" -- a hired killer -- and she hadn't killed him the night before because witnesses had seen him entering her apartment. To Hooker's bewildered ""Who are you?"", the gunman replies ""Gondorff asked me to look after you.""Lonnegan, with half a million dollars in a suitcase, receives his tip in the drugstore and goes to Gondorff's gambling parlor to place the bet. The betting clerk needs Gondorff's approval to accept such a large bet; there's some taunting and snarling between Gondorff and Lonnegan before Gondorff accepts it. Lonnegan sits down to listen to the race. He's joined by Kid Twist (Harold Gould), the faux Western Union manager who's been calling in Lonnegan's tips. When Lonnegan mentions that he bet on the tipped horse to win, Kid Twist, shocked, tells him the bet should have been to place, not to win. In a panic, Lonnegan tries to rescind the wager, but it's too late.While Lonnegan is shouting, the FBI bursts in to arrest Gondorff. Having secured the mastermind, his prize, Polk tells Hooker he can go. Hooker throws a guilty look at Gondorff and starts to slink away, but Gondorff pulls a gun and shoots him in the back. Polk shoots Gondorff. Lonnegan, standing nearby, can see that Hooker is bleeding from the mouth; both men look quite dead. Lt. Snyder, whose job is to get Lonnegan away as quickly as possible, duly hustles him out, telling him he doesn't want to be mixed up with dead bodies. Lonnegan is distraught, saying he left a half million dollars inside.Back in the gambling den, good cheer reigns. The dead have risen and are congratulating one another and their many accomplices -- including the erstwhile FBI agents -- for a job well done. The set is already being disassembled; Gondorff tells the mobsters where to pick up their share of the take and he and Hooker leave together."

She goes alone to look at an apartment in a region of the Left Bank. There, she runs into a middle-aged, obviously depressed man (Marlon Brando) who is also looking at it. Jeanne quickly identifies him as an American because of his thick accent while they are communicating in French. After a few minutes of silence and some quiet dialogue, he picks her up, backs her against a wall, rips off her panties and has sex with her in the deserted apartment. They are very passionate yet never introduce themselves. When it is over, they each go their separate ways.Jeanne goes to the Paris Metro train station to meet her fiancée Tom (Jean-Pierre Leaud), a young television documentarian who has just returned to Paris following an assignment. They walk back to Jeanne's apartment where she currently lives with her mother having taken care of her since her father, a soldier in the French Foreign Legion, was killed in action in 1958 in Algeria. Despite their genuine loving engagement to be married, Jeanne is unhappy and annoyed that Tom insists on doing a cinéma vérité documentary all about her life and of her father, who is a well-known war hero. He films everything she does.Meanwhile, the middle-aged American man, who is named Paul, returns to a flophouse hotel in a run-down part of the city where he ventures to his apartment and watches a maid wash blood off the bathtub and surrounding walls. The maid speaks to Paul about the fact his French wife, Rose, two days earlier committed suicide in the bathtub by slashing her wrists. Paul doesn't say much and goes to his room to be by himself.The next day, Paul and Jeanne rendezvous back at the vacant apartment. Paul lays out ground rules that they are never to reveal their names to each other and never to discuss the outside world or to talk about their pasts. They are to meet there twice a week only for sex and tell no one about each other. But Jeanne (who has some knowledge of English after overhearing Paul talking to himself about his miserable life) keeps trying to find out who the strange American man is. Paul is adamant and refuses to talk about anything for he only wants to have sex with her and nothing else. Jeanne, unhappy with her own personal life, agrees to their arrangement. They lease several items of furniture (couch, chairs, table, bed, etc.) and bring it to the apartment which Paul signs a lease under a false name.The following day, Paul meets with Rose's mother (Maria Michi) to talk about the funeral arrangements. Paul soon becomes furious with her, screaming and cursing at her in a mixture of English and French, after she tells him she wants Rose to have absolution from a priest. Paul does not think that a person who committed suicide should receive absolution because (in his mind) killing oneself is a mortal sin.Meanwhile, Jeanne takes Tom and his camera crew on a tour of her former childhood house and shows him all her antiques. She will not tell him about her very first love who was her cousin. Ironically, Jeanne's cousin was also named Paul (not the same man.)Back in the apartment, Jeanne and Paul meet again where Jeanne wants to talk about her cousin, but Paul angrily stops her, reminding Jeanne of their agreement not to reveal anything, not even about what she did during the day. However, Paul soon relents and agrees to let her briefly talk about her cousin on the condition that no names are to be used. Jeanne talks about her cousin being the first man that she ever had sex with and that it was awkward, but nice. Paul then talks about his youth in the American Midwest and his unhappy childhood. Jeanne is proud she got some information about him, but Paul hints that he wasn't telling the truth. Jeanne becomes angry and asserts that Paul is an egoist and correctly assumes that something terrible happened in his life to explain his need to vent his anger and rage by having a meaningless sexual relationship with her. Paul will neither deny nor admit that Jeanne is right about him. Fed up with his arrogance and egotism, Jeanne masturbates.Another day or so later, Paul visits Marcel (Massimo Girotti), a tenant who lives in the hotel/flophouse that he and Rose managed and operated. It turns out that Marcel was Rose's secret lover. Paul doesn't know what she saw in Marcel or why she killed herself.Jeanne continues to get angry with Tom over filming her wherever she goes. After another argument with Tom, she returns to the vacant apartment to meet with Paul again, wanting to have sex wit him. She is shocked when Paul sodomizes her with a stick of butter, and forces her to renounce the Holy family, the Catholic Church, and all that broke her will as a child. It is painful for her, but she obeys.Another day later, Jeanne is in her wedding dress with her mother and various relatives and guests at the wedding rehearsal. Jeanne becomes more frustrated and insecure with everything happening around her and she leaves the rehearsal and returns to the vacant apartment, still wearing her wedding dress to meet with Paul again. She tells him that she couldn't leave him; although she is engaged to be married to someone she insists she loves while she does not love Paul. After helping her change out of her dress and bathing her, Paul tells Jeanne that true love in this world doesn't exist. To find her true love, Paul says, she ""must go up into the ass of death"". He orders her to snip off her fingernails on two of her fingers and put the fingers ""up my ass"". She obeys. They are both delirious with passion.A little later, Rose's funeral and wake are held at the flophouse. Afterwords, Paul sits alone by Rose's coffin. He insults her dead body terribly over why she committed suicide and left him all alone. He then realizes that he never really did know her or the person that she really was. He cries. He calls her ""sweetheart"". He wished he knew why she killed herself and left behind no note or reason for the act. He wishes he could do the same. He pauses when a prostitute arrives at the flophouse with a client, but Paul chases them away. He follows the prostitute's client a short distance and assaults him before fleeing.A few days later, Jeanne arrives at the apartment only to find it deserted. The ""mysterious American"" (Paul) is gone. It would appear that he has left her for good. Tearfully, she goes back to Tom and asks him to come look at the apartment. After visiting the flat and looking around, Jeanne asks Tom if it would be a good place for both of them to live after they get married. He doesn't like it and thinks it smells due to a musky odor as if someone had recently had sex in the apartment. He insists that the two of them live somewhere else as adults and not as overgrown, oversexed children. Tom walks out, leaving Jeanne all by herself.A little later, while Jeanne is walking on a boulevard, Paul comes up to her. Jeanne insists that their relationship is over for she has decided to get married to Tom. (She defiantly tells Paul her fiancée's name after he angrily tells her ""I said no names!""). Being the egoist that he is, Paul won't accept her decision to break up with him, and he finally begins to tell her all about himself and about how his wife committed suicide weeks earlier (without revealing his name or wife's name). Paul wants to continue their secret relationship of sex to purge his painful feelings about his wife's suicide. All he wants is meaningless sex because he does not want to feel anything at all.Paul and Jeanne spend the rest of the day getting drunk in a cafe where a tango dance contest is taking place. After Paul pesters her, Jeanne alternately tells him that she does love him, but that their relationship is over for she has still decided to marry Tom. They then join the rest of the tango dancers on the dance floor, where she masturbates him, but then runs off, telling Paul ""it's finished!"" Paul chases after her through the streets, telling her that it will never end.Jeanne runs back to her mother's apartment where Paul forces himself inside and tells her that he will never let her go. Paul tells Jeanne that he needs her in order to continue not to feel anything. It is here that Paul finally asks Jeanne to tell him her name. Just after Jeanne tells Paul her name, he lunges at her and she pulls out a pistol from a desk drawer (her father's military service revolver) and fatally shoots Paul once in the chest. Paul stumbles out to the balcony to view the sights of Paris one last time before he collapses to the floor of the balcony, dead. The final shot shows a shaken Jeanne rehearsing with herself over what to tell the police, as she prepares to call them, telling them that she does not know the man who assaulted her, or his name."

The conversation turns to dreams, and each man tells of a recurring nightmare;""Midnight Mess"" (Tales from the Crypt story #35)Harold Rodgers (Daniel Massey) tracks his sister Donna (Anna Massey) to a strange village, and kills her to claim her share of the family inheritance. After settling down to a post-murder meal at the local restaurant, he discovers the entire town is home to a nest of vampires: Donna is not as dead as he thinks, and he becomes the dish of the night when his jugular vein is tapped out as a beverage dispenser.""The Neat Job"" (Shock SuspenStories #1)The obsessively neat Arthur Critchit (Terry-Thomas) marries Eleanor (Glynis Johns), a ""young"" trophy wife who is not quite the housekeeper he hoped for. His constant nagging about the mess she makes eventually drives her mad. Upon his shouting at her, ""Can't you do anything neatly?!"", she kills him with a hammer and cuts up the corpse, putting all the different organs into neatly labeled jars.""This Trick'll Kill You"" (Tales from the Crypt story #33)Sebastian (Curt Jurgens) is a magician on a working holiday in India, where he and his wife Inez (Dawn Addams) are searching for new tricks. Nothing impresses until he sees a girl charming a rope out of a basket with a flute. Unable to work out how the trick is done, he persuades her to come to his hotel room, where he and his wife murder her and steal the enchanted rope. Sebastian plays the flute, and the rope rises; realizing that they have discovered a piece of genuine magic, the couple begin plans to work it into their act. Inez experiments with climbing the rope, only to disappear with a scream. An ominous patch of blood appears on the ceiling, and the rope coils round Sebastian's neck and hangs him. Their victim reappears alive in the bazaar.""Bargain in Death"" (Tales from the Crypt story #28)Maitland (Michael Craig) is a greedy businessman who is buried alive as part of an insurance scam concocted with his friend Alex (Edward Judd). Alex double-crosses Maitland, leaving him to suffocate in the coffin. Two trainee doctors, Tom and Jerry (Robin Nedwell and Geoffrey Davies), bribe a gravedigger to dig up a corpse to help with their studies. When Maitland's coffin is opened, he jumps up gasping for air, scaring Tom and Jerry who run out into the middle of the road in front of Alex's car, which crashes into a tree and explodes. The gravedigger kills Maitland, and when trying to close the sale of the corpse apologizes to Tom and Jerry for the damage to the head.""Drawn and Quartered"" (Tales from the Crypt story #26)Moore (Tom Baker) is an impoverished hippy painter living in Haiti. When he learns that his paintings have been sold for high prices by art dealers Diltant and Gaskill after being praised by critic Fenton Breedley, all of whom told him that they were worthless, he goes to a voodoo priest and his painting hand is given voodoo power; whatever he paints or draws can be harmed by damaging its image. Rather awkwardly, these events coincide with his completing a self-portrait, which he keeps under lock and key to prevent the magic from turning on him. Returning to London, Moore paints portraits of the three men who cheated him, and mutilates the paintings to exact his revenge. He is also obliged to put his own portrait out in the open, because leaving it in an airless strongbox nearly suffocated him. A workman subsequently drops a can of paint thinner on the picture through a skylight, and Moore, as a result of the voodoo, suffers a correspondingly messy death.EpilogueWhen the story of the final dream is told, the five ponder the meaning of their nightmares. The lift door opens, and they find themselves looking out onto a graveyard. Rodgers, Critchit, Maitland, and Moore walk out into the graveyard and disappear one by one. Sebastian remains behind and explains to the viewers that they are all damned souls compelled to tell the stories of their evil deeds for all eternity. He then turns back into the room, which is now a mausoleum, walks towards the casket and disappears himself. Then the door slams shut."

Pusser moves his wife Pauline (Elizabeth Hartman) and their two children, Mike (Leif Garrett) and Dwana (Dawn Lyn), into a home a short distance from his parents, Carl (Noah Beery) and Helen (Lurene Tuttle). Soon after settling in, Buford reunites with old friend Lutie McVeigh (Ed Call), who is delighted to show Buford just how much the area has changed in his absence by taking him to the Lucky Spot roadhouse one afternoon. After Lutie promptly loses money playing craps, he borrows $50 from Buford who then watches the next round carefully. Spotting a player with an extra pair of dice, Buford accuses him of cheating, prompting the proprietor Buel Jaggers (Arch Johnson) and his men to attack Buford. A fierce brawl ensues in which Lutie is knocked out and Buford is eventually overpowered by four men. On Jaggers orders, his men carve several deep wounds into Buford's chest and back before dumping him in a roadside ditch and driving away in his car.After being taken home by a trucker, Buford is treated by Dr. Lamar Stivers (Don Keefer) and questioned by Sheriff Al Thurman (Gene Evans), who downplays the assault as men letting off steam. A few days later, Thurman returns to the Pusser home with his deputy Grady Coker (Bruce Glover) to report that he has not located Buford's car. Although Thurman implies that Lutie's reputation for telling tall tales will not help Buford if he presses charges against Jaggers, Buford insists on proceeding.After commencing work at his father's logging farm, Buford meets school friend Obra Eaker (Felton Perry), a young black man, and hires him immediately. When no action is taken on Bufords charge against Jaggers and his men, Buford fashions a large stick at the mill and goes to the Lucky Spot at closing where he bashes in the arm of each of the men involved in his assault. Buford then demands the frightened bookkeeper reimburse him for his lost car, his hospital bills and the money taken from him and Lutie.The next day, the corrupt Sheriff Thurman arrests Buford on charges of assault and robbery and, after Judge R.W. Clarke (Douglas V. Fowley) threatens him with a long sentence, Buford decides to represent himself in court. Just before the trial is about to begin, Carl informs Buford that Lutie's body has been discovered in the lake. Informing the jury that his only witness has been killed, Buford removes his shirt to display the multiple scars from his attack, prompting the jury to clear Buford of all charges. Delighted, Obra then suggests that Buford use his new popularity to run against Thurman for sheriff. Although Pauline pleads with Buford not to involve himself further in the regions rampant corruption, Buford decides to run against Thurman.Incensed, Thurman begins tracking Buford, hoping to catch him in any minor infraction. Pleased to find Buford speeding one day, Thurman races after him and tries to force Buford off the road several times, only to drive off a bridge and crash. Buford is able to pull Grady to safety, but the car burns before he can rescue Thurman.Soon after at the Lucky Spot, Jaggers meets with the other area club gangster owners, including Augie McCullah (Kenneth Tobey), the head of the regions illegal activities, and Callie Hacker (Rosemary Murphy), the madam who runs the sprawling Pine Ridge Club brothel. Despite Callie's orders to the others to spend lavishly to prevent Buford from being elected, he wins.On his first day as sheriff, Buford commands his deputies to apply the law equally and accept no bribes. Soon after, Buford is summoned to a morgue to view the bodies of eight black civil rights workers who died after apparently drinking poisoned moonshine. Offering Obra a position as deputy sheriff, Buford presses him for help and Obra takes him to the areas largest still, run by Willie Rae Lockman (Sam Laws), a black man who also owns a small nightclub near the Mississippi border. Arresting everyone at the still, Buford is dismayed when Judge Clarke later throws out all the charges because the new sheriff did not follow proper procedures in securing warrants and informing the accused of their rights.Although frustrated, Buford proceeds more carefully and soon has his deputies making regular checks for illegal liquor at the areas bars and roadhouses. Some time later, Buford receives a visit by government representative John Witter (Logan Ramsey), who advises Buford that harassing local businesses has ramifications in the state capital, Nashville. When Buford refuses Witters invitation to visit Nashville, Witter cautions him that ideals and reality are often very far apart.Undaunted, Buford, Obra, Grady and the deputies resume making surprise checks on all the clubs, angering the various owners, but Callie warns that Witter has instructed them to leave Buford alone temporarily as his activities in McNairy County have received attention in the Nashville press. Meanwhile, Buford remains frustrated in his dealings with the corrupt Judge Clarke, who continually undercuts guilty verdicts of gamblers and liquor runners by applying minimal fines and few detentions.Later, Buford is outraged when a surprise simultaneous mass search of all the area clubs yields no illegal activities, suggesting there is an informer on Buford's staff. One night while taking a back road home, a car races past Buford and when he gives chase and pulls the car over, he is shot twice in the chest. Recovering at home, Buford bitterly notes the get-well gifts from the corrupt club owners and, despite Pauline's pleas, insists he must start carrying a gun in addition to his large stick.Soon after, Buford assembles all his deputies and proceeds to a new still that he plans to destroy. There he accuses deputy Virgil Button (Ted Jordan) of betraying him, as he is the only one who knew of Buford driving the back roads home. When Virgil breaks down and admits to taking bribes, Buford fires him.Over the next several days, Buford makes numerous successful raids on the clubs, prompting Callie to suspect that the organization now has a leak. Although Jaggers suggests killing Buford, Callie hesitates as Witter's has not authorized so drastic an act. Acting on his own, one of Jaggers men ambushes Buford's home a few nights later, firing two shot gun blasts through the living room window, resulting in the death of the family dog. Buford runs after the assailant and kills him.Soon after, Luan Paxton (Brenda Benét), one of the prostitutes at the Lucky Spot who has befriended Buford and has been informing him about the illegal activities the gangs are part of, telephones him with a tip that Callie and her henchman are torturing one of the other girls, Margie Ann, whom they suspect of informing. Buford rescues Margie Ann and beats up Callie's man in front of her. Later, Buford provides Luan with money to leave town safely.Outraged by Buford's boldness, Callie fakes the robbery of a jewel salesman on Christmas Day at the Lucky Spot to lure Buford there. When he arrives, she opens fire on him with a shotgun blast that hits several customers, but misses the sheriff, who shoots and kills her.After Callie's death, there is a lull in criminal activity in McNairy County. One morning, shortly after a pleasant picnic with his family, Buford receives an early morning call regarding trouble at a new still, and when Pauline asks to accompany Buford, he agrees. On the drive, two cars carrying Jaggers, McCullah and their men drive by the Pussers and riddle the car with gunshots, killing Pauline with a random shot to the back of her head. Pulling over, Buford hysterically radios for help, but Jaggers and McCullah drive by again, shoot Buford in the face and leave him for dead.Soon after Pauline's funeral, Buford, swathed in a heavy neck and face cast, drives out to the Lucky Spot and plows his car into the club, running down Jaggers and McCullah. Afterward, Obra and Grady arrive to take Buford back to the hospital while numerous townsfolk set fire to the Lucky Spot to reclaim law and order for their town."

tt0070909,"['Action', 'SciFi', 'Thriller', 'Western']","It is sometime in the near future, in a fictional high-tech adult amusement park called Delos. The park is divided into three zones: WesternWorld, MedievalWorld and RomanWorld. The entertainment in all three areas consists primarily of interaction by the guests with androids programmed to act in character (the Old West, medieval Europe, and pre-Christian Rome, respectively). The androids are indistinguishable from human beings, apart from minor flaws in their hands, and guests are encouraged to indulge in any fantasy, including killing the androids. The androids are programmed to respond positively to guest requests, specifically including requests for sex. Delos's guests pay $1,000 a day for the experience.Peter Martin (Benjamin) a first-timer and his friend John Blane (Brolin), who has visited previously, come to the WesternWorld zone, where one of the main attractions is the Gunslinger (Yul Brynner), a robot programmed to start duels. Thanks to its programming, humans can always outdraw the Gunslinger and kill it. The guns issued to the guests also have temperature sensors that prevent them from firing at each other or anything else living but allow them to 'kill' the room-temperature androids.Gradually, the technicians running Delos begin to notice problems with the androids. In what may be the first mention of the concept of a computer virus in a film, the technical staff describe inexplicable problems and breakdowns spreading ""like a disease"" between the machines, first in one area of the park and then on to the others. First, the robots in MedievalWorld begin suffering an inexplicable number of systemic failures. Then, a robot rattlesnake strikes Blane. Against her programming, a female servant android refuses a guest's request for sex. The failures increase until the robotic Black Knight kills a guest in a sword-fight in MedievalWorld. The resort's supervisors, in increasing desperation, attempt to regain control by shutting down power to the entire park. Unfortunately, this results in trapping them in the control rooms, unable to turn the power back on again while the robots run amok on stored power.Martin and Blane, who have been passed out drunk after a bar fight in the WesternWorld bordello, wake up unaware that there has been a change for the worse. The two men are confronted by the Gunslinger, who challenges them to a showdown. Blane treats the confrontation like a joke, until the robot shoots and kills him. Martin runs for his life as the robot implacably follows him.Martin flees to the other areas of the park, but finds only a panicky fleeing technician, dead guests and damaged robots. He manages to open a manhole leading to the underground control area, where the resort's technicians have suffocated since the ventilation shut down. The Gunslinger stalks Martin through the corridors, arriving at the robot repair facility where Martin lies in wait, pretending to be a disabled robot. Martin ambushes the Gunslinger by throwing a beaker of hydrochloric acid, found among the repair materials, into its face. Thinking he has disabled the Gunslinger, he leaves the service area and enters MedievalWorld.However, Martin is again followed by the Gunslinger, whose face has melted but who is still functioning, though its visible spectrum optics were destroyed by the acid. The robot can still see Martin, but only via infrared backups, and is confused when he moves in front of several flaming torches, something it would not have been programmed to deal with in WesternWorld. The Gunslinger begins to leave the room, but Martin accidentally makes a noise, allowing the Gunslinger to zero in on him again. When it lunges to strike, its ammunition exhausted, Martin seizes the opportunity to set fire to it with a large torch.Thinking this has destroyed the robot, Martin leaves the burning Gunslinger and wanders out of the great hall, finding what he believes to be a female guest chained up in the dungeon. He releases her and gives her a drink of water, whereupon her face bursts into sparks, revealing she is a machine. Backing away in shock, he is confronted by the still moving burned hulk of the Gunslinger, which continues its attempt to attack him. However, it falls off a high set of steps in the process and, finally succumbing to damage, shuts down. Martin, apparently the sole survivor of the humans at Delos, simply sits down on the dungeon steps in a state of near-exhaustion and shock, thinking of the irony of Delos's advertising, ""Have we got a vacation for you!"""
tt0070917,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","Sergeant Neil Howie of the West Highland Police receives an anonymous letter requesting his presence on Summerisle, a remote Hebridean island famed for its popular and unusually abundant fruit produce. A young girl named Rowan Morrison has been missing for a number of months and her mother is being uncooperative with enquiries. Due to the island's isolation it is unlikely she could have left by herself, abduction is suspected.Howie, a devout and celibate Christian, travels by seaplane to the island and is profoundly disturbed to find a society that worships the old pagan, Celtic gods of their ancestors. Couples copulate openly in the fields, children are taught in school of the phallic importance of the maypole, toads are placed in the mouth to cure whooping cough, and the island has no Christian ministers or priests. Its church and graveyards have long been deconsecrated and are now used for the idiosyncratic burial rituals of the locals, who believe in re-incarnation.In the course of his investigation, Howie encounters difficulty in extracting information from the islanders, who claim never to have heard of Rowan, and whose own mother insists does not exist. Rooming at The Green Man Inn, where he is introduced to the beautiful young daughter of the landlord, Willow, Howie notices a series of photographs celebrating the island's annual harvests adorning the wall of the bar with each photograph featuring a young girl, the May Queen. The latest photograph is missing due to it being ""broken"". No negative exists.After discovering a grave bearing Rowan Morrison's name in the cemetery, Howie's search eventually brings him into contact with the island's community leader, Laird and de facto figurehead Lord Summerisle, who explains to Howie the island's recent history and culture. Summerisle's grandfather, a distinguished Victorian scientist, developed several new strains of fruit that he believed could prosper in Scotland's climate given the proper conditions. Drawn to Summerisle's unique combination of fertile, volcanic soil and local waters heated by the Gulf Stream, he inculcated in the local populace a belief that the old gods were real and worshipping them by farming the new crop strains would deliver them from their meagre livelihood. The crops bore fruit and the island's Christian clergy were driven away, with the population now embracing pagan teachings wholesale. Enraged by Summerisle's glib comment that the Christian god is ""dead"", Howie demands permission to exhume Rowan's body, which Lord Summerisle subsequently grants, confident in the belief that such a deeply religious community as his is incapabale of murder. Howie's exhumation of the grave reveals only the body of a hare. He angrily confronts Summerisle once more, declaring that he believes that Rowan Morrison was murdered as part of a pagan sacrifice and that he intends to bring the full weight of the law upon the inhabitants of the island.Breaking into the local chemist's shop, Howie discovers that a negative of last year's harvest photograph does in fact exist. It shows Rowan standing amidst a meagre, pathetic group of boxes, indicating that last year's harvest was a poor one and that the crops the island's only means of income had failed. Struck by his recollection of an offhand remark made by Lord Summerisle about appeasing the old gods ""when necessary"" and by research that indicates pagan societies offer up a human sacrifice in the event of crop failure, Howie deduces that Rowan is in fact still alive and that she is being kept hidden until she can be sacrificed as part of the May Day celebrations to ensure a plentiful harvest for the coming year.Howie spends another night at the Inn where, in the room next to his, Willow sings to him and openly attempts to seduce him. The next morning, discovering that his plane has been sabotaged and is unable to take off, Howie elects to search the island for Rowan himself ahead of the impending May Day parade. Howie ties up the innkeeper and assumes his place as Punch, a principal character of the May Day festival. Disguised, he joins the procession of islanders as they cavort through the town and perform harmless sacrifices to the various lesser gods. Then Lord Summerisle announces that a grimmer sacrifice awaits them, and Rowan is finally revealed, tied to a post. Howie cuts her free and flees through a cave but after a brief chase emerges at another entrance on a precipice where Summerisle and his followers stand waiting for them. Howie is shocked to see Rowan merrily embrace her captors and then notices that he is being surrounded.Lord Summerisle explains to Howie that, after painstaking research on their behalf, he specifically was lured to Summerisle by the islanders, who have been successful in a conspiracy to lead him to believe that a missing girl was being held captive against her will, and confirms to him that last year's harvest failed disastrously, threatening the inhabitants with a return to their previously desperate existence and that they have no intention of allowing that to happen. Their religion calls for a sacrifice to be made to the Sun god as Lord Summerisle explains that, ""animals are fine, but their acceptibility is limited. A young child is even better, but not nearly as effective as the right kind of adult."" Howie's devout Christian lifestyle and his livelihood as a policeman mean that he meets the outstanding criteria for a human that is to be sacrificed to appease the gods he has come of his own free will, with the power of a king and he is a virgin. In spite of his protestations that the crops failed because fruit was not meant to grow on these islands and that next year the sacrifice of Lord Summerisle himself will be called for, Howie is stripped bare, then dressed in ceremonial robes and led to the summit of a cliff with his hands tied. He is horrified to find a giant, hollow wicker man statue which he is then locked inside. The statue is soon set afire. As the islanders surround the burning wicker man and sing the Middle English folk-song ""Sumer Is Icumen In"", a terrified Howie curses them and recites Psalm 23 as he prays to God for accession to Heaven. The film ends as the burning head of the wicker man falls from its shoulders, as the sun sets in a blood-red sky."

Costa-Gavros also directed Missing, a film about this event starring Jack Lemmon and Sissie Spacek.The historical figure played by Yves Montand in State of Siege was Dan Mitrioni, a former Indiana police chief working in Montevideo within USAID's Office of Public Safety, which in fact was training civilian police in kidnapping, torture and assassinations of suspected Communists parallel to School of the Americas training of South American military personnel. The film opens with the American found dead in the back of a car. We subsequently learn how and why this came about. The Tupamoros, a popular Uruguay insurgency that robbed the rich and gave to the poor, had captured and interrogated the American ""trainer"" at length about his actions and motivations. The captive-captors interactions that take the form of a trial are the heart of the film, revealing the motives and objectives of the insurgents and the defensive rationalizations underlying violent American interference in Latin American governments. The American never breaks and confesses, so they are left with no alternative but to execute him for his many capital crimes.Both Contra-Gavras films provide important history lessons that Americans receive from neither their schools nor their media.

Emmi decides to invite him over for the night. Ali cannot sleep and asks Emmi if he can talk with her for awhile in her room. He tells how lonely he is, and that maybe he isnt human at all. Emmi comforts him and tells him that that simply isnt true. The next morning Emmi wakes up to find Ali in her bed. At first she cannot believe what has happened and hurriedly leaves the room. She looks at herself in the bathroom mirror, and Ali finds her with tears running down her face. All she sees is her old age, but Ali does not see it. They look at each other and embrace each other. Next Emmi and Ali have breakfast together before they set off for work. She calls herself an old woman, but Ali does not see her as one. He sees her as a good person with a big heart. Emmi is so happy but she starts to cry out of fear. Ali tells her that fear isnt good, that it eats the soul. The two go downstairs together and part ways while Mrs. Karges watches from upstairs.Later that day Emmi is on her lunch break at work. As she eats with her co-workers they get on the topic of foreigners and how they all they care about is money and sex. Emmi tries to defend foreigners but it is obvious that these women will not change their minds about them. They think that a woman should die of shame if she were to ever become involved with such a man.Next Emmi goes to visit her daughter Krista (Irm Hermann) and her husband Eugen (Rainer Werner Fassbinder). Eugen is home from work on sick leave, and he and Krista keep bickering in front of Emmi. She changes the subject by asking about foreign workers at Eugens job. This upsets him greatly and he barks at his wife to get his cigarettes. Emmi then proclaims she has fallen in love with a Moroccan who is at least 20 years younger than her. Krista and Eugen think she is joking and laugh. She tells them it is no joke and leaves the apartment, but they still do not take her seriously. The whole idea is too unbelievable to be true.That evening Emmi returns to the bar where she met Ali the night before. She sits at the same table and orders a cola. The bartender brings her the drink and states that it isnt raining. She makes it abundantly clear that it was her bar and that Emmi was not welcome in it. Emmi sits there in hopes of running into Ali. She quickly leaves the bar and walks home, where she finds Ali waiting for her outside. They greet each other and go upstairs together.Next we see Emmi and Ali eating together in Emmis kitchen. As Emmi clears the table and gets them coffee Ali tells her that he has money to give her. He wants to pay her back for all the food and drinks she has provided. Emmi thinks that money will spoil their friendship and says she will put the money in a drawer for him when he needs it. Ali wants Emmi to take the money but she utterly refuses. They are then interrupted by Mr. Gruber (Marquard Bohm), the landlords son. Gruber comes by to tell her that she is not allowed to sublet to others and that Ali must move out. Emmi panics and tells him that Ali is not renting from her but they are actually getting married. Since that is the case the matter is resolved, or so Gruber thinks. Once he leaves Emmi tells Ali what she has done, and he thinks it is a good idea. He agrees to marry her and they have a drink before telling the news to his Arab buddies.Emmi and Ali go to the bar and celebrate their engagement with his friends. The brunette that was at the bar in the beginning of the film appears again and she is disgusted by the news. She calls Emmi is a filthy old whore, which then the bartender points out her jealousy. Emmi puts on a song on the jukebox and she and Ali dance to it. The other woman says that it will never work out because it is so unnatural.The next scene begins with Emmi and Ali leaving the courthouse where they have just gotten married. It is only the two of them and they are both dressed in grey suits, and Emmi has a bouquet of red flowers. As they walk together Emmi points out how long her new name is. She is now Emanuela ben Salem MBarek Mohammed Mustapha. She thinks it sounds terrific. They stop at a phone booth where Emmi calls her daughter Krista. She invites her and her two sons over to her house next Saturday. When Krista asks her why Emmi tells her theres no special reason. Emmi sees a taxi and tells Ali to stop it.The taxi then takes them to a restaurant called Osteria Italiana. It is where Hitler used to eat and Emmi had always wanted to eat there. The entire restaurant is empty except for the two of them and the waiter who is staring at them from the doorway. Emmi suggests they order the most expensive things on the menu, since it is such a special day. Ali says he will eat whatever she eats. She calls the waiter over and orders their food. The waiter asks her how she would like the Chateaubriand prepared. She is confused about the question, so the waiter asks if she wants it rare or medium. She tells him rare sounds good. Then she changes her mind once the waiter explains that rare means almost raw. The waiter then asks if they would like an aperitif to start with. Emmi is not sure which one to ask for, so the waiter recommends the house aperitif. After the waiter walks away Emmi says how he really had her on the rack there and it can be difficult if you are not used to things like that. The couple stares at each other and then they both stare forward. The scene ends with them looking ahead through the doorway.Emmis children have come over to her house at her request. Albert, Bruno, Krista and her husband are all sitting in the living room waiting for Emmis announcement. They are all curious as to why she has asked them there, and one of her sons asks if she is ill. Emmi tells them she is not ill but has gotten married. They are all shocked. They ask who she has married, so she calls Ali into the room. She introduces him to the children, who all stare at them with blank expressions on their faces. The room is silent until Bruno walks over to the television and kicks in the glass. He storms out of the apartment and Krista goes after him. Albert stands and tells Emmi that their marriage is a disgrace. She can forget that she has any children, and that he will have nothing to do with a whore. Krista comes back and tells her husband that they are living this pigsty. Once they leave Emmi breaks down into tears.Next Ali is at the local store trying to buy some Libelle margarine. The store owner (Walter Sedlmayr) keeps giving him lemonade even though Ali repeatedly tells him like butter, not lemonade. The owner barks at him to learn German and that he cannot help him. Adele (Doris Mattes) comes out and asks him what Ali wants. He tells her that he wants Libelle, which she says is the new margarine. The owner does in fact know what Ali wanted, but he just refuses to help him. Ali leaves the store.Ali comes home and tells Emmi what has happened. She knows that the owner understood Ali and just didnt want to serve him. She has been a customer at that store for twenty years and is furious. Ali says not to fight, that fighting isnt good. Emmi leaves the apartment to have a word with the shopkeeper.Emmi arrives at the store and Mr. Angermeyer why he wont serve her husband. He says that he couldnt understand what Ali was saying. She tells him that Ali asked for Libelle margarine. He pretends that he didnt know thats what Ali wanted. Emmi knew he understood him perfectly but he just didnt want to help a foreigner. Angermeyer does not appreciate Emmi accusing him of discrimination and that he cannot serve someone who cant speak German. Emmi angrily tells him that is nonsense and that Ali speaks better German than him. This upsets Angermeyer and he bans Emmi from the store.Emmi walks home from the store to find some of the neighbors standing in the stairwell. They stop her and tell her that everyone in the building has agreed that she has to clean the stairwell twice a month instead of their usual system. The three women say that there has been a lot more dirt than usual and that she should clean it since she brought a foreigner home. Emmi tells Mrs. Karges to mind her own business, since she does not meddle in her affairs. Mrs. Karges says that they have nothing to be ashamed of like she does. Emmi accuses her of jealousy and continues up the stairs. Mrs. Karges is shocked by the notion and wonders whatever Emmi could mean by that.Ali comes home to find Emmi sitting in the kitchen. She looks at his paystub and sees that he worked five hours overtime. She jokingly says that she thought he was off boozing somewhere. Ali doesnt understand what she means. Emmi explains herself and he says that he doesnt drink without her. She adds together their earnings and says that they will be rich, and that they will buy a little piece of heaven. He asks her why heaven? and she says it is just a fancy of hers. Ali gets up to take a shower and she offers to make him coffee.Emmi walks into the bathroom and sees Ali in the shower. She looks at him and tells him that he is very beautiful and that his coffee is ready. Ali continues to wash himself.Ali steps out into the kitchen and Emmi hands him his coffee. The doorbell rings and Emmi goes to answer it. Her coworker Paula (Gusti Kreissl) came over to see if Emmi could work her shift for her so she could attend her sisters funeral. She invites her into the living room where she introduces her to Ali. Paula is shocked to find out that they have been married for three months. She quickly excuses herself and says she will ask someone else to cover her shift. Ali says that that woman is no good, but Emmi just writes it off as just shock. He knows that she was disgusted by him and says that she had death in her eye. Emmi tells him he is imagining things and to get dressed. Ali suggests they go out to see his Arab buddies since Germans are not good. Emmi doesnt feel like going out but tells him to invite his friends over to their apartment.Ali goes to the bar to invite his friends over. No one is there yet except for the bartender. As she pours him a beer she asks him if he is happy, to which Ali says he doesnt know. She tells him to come over to her place sometime and she will make him couscous. He tells her that he doesnt know if he will, so she asks him if he is scared of his wife. This upsets him and he says he is not. She again tells him to come over, and he says maybe. One of Alis buddies and the brunette woman walk into the bar. They greet each other and Ali invites them over to his house. The woman says she will not go to that old whores place. Ali grabs her by her dress and tells her that Emmi is not an old whore. He lets her go and the two men walk to the door. They run into two other men on the way out and they all leave for Emmis. The bartender and the woman are left alone watching them leave.Later Mrs. Karges and another neighbor are in the stairwell talking to two police officers. They complain to them that the party going on in Emmis apartment is too loud. They also tell the officers that she has four Arabs in her apartment and that it isnt safe. The officers tell them not to exaggerate and that they will speak with Emmi. They walk up the stairs and the two women stay where they are, commenting on the policemens long hair.Ali and three of his buddies sit in the living room and play a game while Emmi watches. The door bell rings and Emmi goes to answer it. The policemen inform her that the neighbors are complaining about the noise and ask her if she could turn the music down. She agrees and says goodnight to the officers. Emmi walks back into the living room and asks Ali to turn down the music. She tells him that the neighbors have sent the police on them. They look out the window and watch the policemen drive away.Emmi is on her lunch break at work and eats with her coworkers in the stairwell. She asks them to pass her a knife, but all three women ignore her. They talk amongst themselves as if she doesnt exist. She tells them to stop acting so strange and asks them again to pass her a knife. They pretend they dont hear her and carry on their conversation. Emmi stands up and gets the knife herself. As she sits down the women decide to move further down the stairs. They continue talking and leave Emmi all by herself.Emmi and Ali leave their apartment building and walk past Mr. Gruber, Mrs. Karges, and the other neighbor woman. As they walk away Mrs. Karges asks Gruber if there is anything that can be done about them. He does not see a problem with Emmi and Ali as tenants. He says they seem happy together. The second woman does not see their happiness, just how indecent their union is. Gruber does not see anything indecent about the couple, though he says he has tried. He says goodbye to the ladies and departs. Mrs. Karges asks the other woman if she can understand such a situation. She says she does not and goes inside.The couple is sitting across from each other at an outdoor café. They are surrounded by dozens of empty yellow tables. Ali looks behind him and sees a group of people staring at them from the doorway. Emmi tells him to ignore them and that they are just envious. Ali doesnt understand so Emmi explains what envious means. She begins to cry. Emmi is so happy to be with the man she loves, but she cant take peoples judgments anymore. She pretends that peoples hatred doesnt bother her but it really does. She screams at the other people to stop staring at them. Ali comforts her as she becomes hysterical. Emmi suggests they go on a trip together to get away from everyone. Then when they get back everything will be different.The shopkeeper sees Emmi and Ali return from their trip. Adele points out how nice Emmi always was. She figures that the marriage wont last and that he should let Emmi shop there again. The shop needs the business and Emmi was always such a good customer. He decides that he will greet her the next time she walks by the store.Emmi and Ali take their things from the car and start walking upstairs. Two neighbors greet Emmi and wish to speak to her about her cellar. Mrs. Ellis son has been sent to Norway for a year and she needs a place to store his things. Emmi offers her space and promises that Ali will help her move. The woman thanks her and Emmi continues upstairs. As they separate the other two ladies comment on how nice and helpful Emmi is.Back at the apartment Emmi gives Ali the cellar keys and tells him to help Mrs. Ellis. If they are nice to her then she will be nice to them. She says she is going shopping and tells Ali to change his clothes.Adele and Mr. Angermeyer see Emmi walking towards their store. Adele tells him to go outside and talk to her. He greets her and invites her inside the store to tell them all about her trip.Emmis son Bruno walks up Emmis stairwell and is greeted by Mrs. Karges. She tells him that Emmi has returned from her trip and has gone out shopping. He thanks her and she proceeds to tell him about Ali helping Mrs. Ellis and about her son going to Norway. Emmi arrives and Bruno walks with her upstairs to her apartment.As Emmi puts things away, Bruno apologizes for breaking the television set. The children have gotten used to the marriage except for Albert. Emmi forgives him and he then asks her for a favor. His wife is going to start working again and they need Emmi to watch their child for a few hours a day. Ali arrives and Bruno shakes his hand. Ali goes to take a shower. Emmi agrees to Brunos favor and he leaves the apartment. Ali asks Emmi if she is going to make couscous. She tells them that she cannot make couscous and that he should get used to the way things are in Germany. Germans dont eat couscous and she herself doesnt like it. Ali leaves to go meet his Arab buddies and to eat couscous. He does not want Emmi to go with him. After he leaves Emmi is left standing alone in her kitchen, staring at the floor.Ali walks to his usual bar but it is closed. He goes to upstairs to the bartenders apartment. At first he hesitates, but then he rings the doorbell. She asks him if he wants anything to eat or drink, so he says he wants couscous. She tells him to help himself to some fig brandy. Later she finds him in the living room staring out the window. He takes off his jacket and she takes off his shirt from behind. They face each other and hug. Ali returns home drunk. He walks around calling Emmis name and tries to find the bedroom. He finds it locked and passes out on the floor. Emmi opens the door and sees him. She leaves him on the floor and closes the door.The next day they eat together in silence. They look at each other but do not say a word. Ali leaves the apartment while Emmi just stares at the table.At work Emmis coworkers greet her at lunch as if nothing has happened. They tell her that Frieda has been fired for stealing. In her place they have hired a foreign woman named Yolanda from Herzegovina. As they are talking one of the women decide that they should talk further down the stairs away from Yolanda. Then they tell Emmi that they are not getting their raise and that Yolanda makes less money than them. Emmi invites them over to her house to discuss how to get their raise. They decide not to invite Yolanda since she is on a different pay scale than them. Yolanda continues to eat her lunch alone.Later that evening the women show up to Emmis place and they meet Ali. They talk about him to Emmi as if he isnt there. They touch and examine him like some prize animal. He leaves the room and they dont know what is wrong with him. Emmi says its simply his foreign mood swings. She leaves the room to get coffee for the women and sees Ali leave the apartment. Again, they stare at each other and do not say a word. She turns back around and smiles at her friends, even though it is quite obvious that she is not in a smiling mood.Ali arrives at the bartenders apartment. She is just on her way out but she invites him to stay and eat leftover couscous. After she leaves he sits on the couch and looks down at the floor.Emmi thinks she hears Ali walking up the stairs. She opens the door and yells for him but it is just Mr. Gruber. She apologizes and begins to cry. Mr. Gruber says goodnight and leaves Emmi crying in her doorway.Ali wakes up on the bartenders couch just as she arrives home. She asks him to stay over for the night. Ali undresses as she cleans up in the bathroom. She walks back into the room naked and turns off the light before walking over to him. They embrace and lie down on the couch together.Ali is at work and one of his coworkers is telling jokes. His boss walks in with Emmi. She confronts Ali and asks him where he has been all night. She tells him how much she misses him and asks him to come back. He stares at her and says nothing. One of the men asks if that his grandmother from Morocco, and all the men laugh. Emmi and Ali stare at each other and she leaves. After she walks out the men continue to laugh at the joke, except for Ali.Later Ali gambles with is buddies at the bar. After he loses a game he sends one of the men to his house to get more money. The bartender scolds him for gambling away his wages. Ali snaps at her and goes into the bathroom. After using the urinal Ali walks over to the mirror. He stares at himself and slaps himself in the face over and over again.Ali comes out of the bathroom just as his friend returns with his money. He plays another hand and Emmi comes into the bar. She sits at a table and orders a cola. Ali loses again. The bartender brings Emmi her drink and she asks her to play The Black Gypsy on the jukebox. When the music starts to play Ali walks over to Emmis table. He asks her to dance with her. She stands and they walk to the dance floor. As they dance Ali confesses that he slept with another woman. She doesnt care but she says that she cannot stop him from doing that. However, she does want them to get along when they are together. Otherwise life isnt worth living. Ali says he doesnt want anyone else and that he only loves her. Emmi says that she loves him too and that together they are strong. Right then Ali collapses to the floor and groans in pain. Emmi tries to comfort him as the bartender calls an ambulanceAt the hospital the doctor explains to Emmi that Ali has a perforated stomach ulcer. It is very common among foreign workers due to the stress. They can only operate and he will probably have another one in six months. He will recover but the doctor guesses he will be back again. Emmi goes to Alis bedside and holds his hand as she cries."
tt0071143,"['Comedy', 'Documentary']","A humorous documentary looking at the animal life over the course of a year that gather around an oasis situated in a desert in Eastern Africa. Highlights of this being the period when the fruit from the trees surrounding the water hole. Fall into the water and ferment. The animals that drink there end up being rather intoxicated, including the hangover the following morning. All together a good, if now a bit dated, piece of documentary making.
The documentary covers all aspects of life around the water hole as the waters change from being in almost flood like conditions. To the water drying up into a large muddy puddle during the dry season. The animals that are featured being as diverse as warthogs, elephants, tortoises and monkeys.
The cinematography is excellent considering the conditions endured and the length of time spent in the field shooting the footage. The resultant film is refreshingly devoid of computer and other special effects, instead relying on the editing and narration to convey events to the audience."
tt0071222,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","The film opens at night on a snow-covered college campus. There is a Christmas party underway in one of the sorority houses, a large converted mansion. The sorority sisters and many of their boyfriends are inside. Outside in the snow, a point-of-view shot illustrates someone looking into the windows. The person breathes heavily and seems to be a man, but this is all we can tell. The person prowls around before climbing a rose trellis and entering the house through an attic window. He then climbs down through the attic trap door and lurks in the upstairs of the house, watching the girls downstairs.One of the sorority sisters, Barb Coard (Margot Kidder), receives a phone call from her mother. Barb seems to have been planning on going home over the Christmas holiday, but her mother has made plans to go away with her latest boyfriend. Barb calls her mother a gold-plated whore and says she'll make other plans for the break. She asks fellow sorority sisters Phyllis Carlson (Andrea Martin) and Jessica Bradford (Olivia Hussey) to go skiing with her instead. Jess also gets a phone call from her boyfriend, Peter (Kier Dullea), an aspiring concert pianist. She seems tense and wants to talk to Peter about something important. She says she'll see him tomorrow at the rehearsal studio. After their boyfriends leave, the girls get another phone call; Jess answers the phone and announces to all the other girls that its ""The Moaner"". Together they listen to the bizarre phone call, which starts out with simply heavy breathing and then
escalates into strange ranting and obscene language. Barb gets on the receiver and bawls out the caller, firing back with her own obscene comments, until the caller suddenly lowers his voice and says ""I'm going to kill you."" He then hangs up.A sorority sister named Clare Harrison (Lynne Griffin) seems more timid than the others. She questions Barb's judgment in provoking an unstable individual, and reminds her that a girl from town was raped recently by an unknown assailant. Barb reacts angrily and upsets Clare, who then goes upstairs to pack; her father is picking her up the next day to take her home for Christmas. Clare finds Claude, the house mother's cat, in her room, even though the door is closed. She is unaware the killer is watching her from within her closet. In a morbid twist, the psychopath meows like Claude and lures Clare into the closet, where he lunges at her and wraps plastic cleaning bags around her head, smothering her to death. He then carries her body up into the attic and places it in a rocking chair by the window, the plastic bag still over her head. He places a doll in her lap and refers to her as Agnes.Downstairs, the other girls are oblivious to Clare's death, and they welcome in the house mother, Mrs. Mac (Marian Waldman), who seems to have just returned from shopping. They present her with a Christmas gift: a frilly nightgown. She pretends to like it but makes sarcastic remarks about it (and the girls themselves) while she is alone. Mrs. Mac goes to the library and seeks a book--""B for Booze!""--and hidden inside of it is a bottle of brandy, from which she takes a secret drink. She later fishes a bottle out of the toilet tank in her bathroom, as well, and rinses her mouth with booze after brushing her teeth.The next day, Clare's father (James Edmond) comes to collect her, but she is not at the appointed place. When he seeks her at the sorority house, he is shocked by the sexually suggestive posters he finds in her room, and also surprised that she has a boy's photo next to her bed (her boyfriend, Chris). Mr. Harrison seems to blame Mrs. Mac for the permissive attitude in the house. Mrs. Mac assures him that Clare is a good girl, and that she's probably just at one of the fraternity houses visiting Chris. Mr. Harrison offers to drop Mrs. Mac off at the store on his way there. Before they leave, Mrs. Mac hears Claude meowing but cannot find him; he is in the attic.Jess visits Peter while he is practicing for a very important audition, and she breaks some news to him: she is unexpectedly pregnant. Peter thinks it's good news, but Jess admits that she wasnt even going to tell Peter about it. Jess intends to get an abortion. Peter is adamantly opposed to this, and makes an ominous threat against Jess for even considering such a thing.Barb is at the fraternity house with Phyl's boyfriend, who is dressed like Santa and taking photos with small children. Barb has a bottle of wine and is getting drunk, and she gives one of the children sips of her alcohol. Mr. Harrison phones home and assures his wife that they will find Clare.Back at the sorority house, Jess receives another obscene phone call. This one is more elaborate; the killer speaks in several different voices and makes references to ""Agnes"" and ""Billy"". He also seems to be speaking in the voices of two adults, presumably the parents of Agnes and Billy. The voices even seem to overlap at times, adding to the unsettling effect. Jess is upset, especially after her confrontation with Peter.Phyl and Barb take Mr. Harrison to the police station to report Clare missing. The officer on duty at the desk, Sgt. Nash (Douglas McGrath), endures hostility from Barb about the incident. Sgt. Nash tells Mr. Harrison that hes sure Clare is just somewhere with Chris. Sgt. Nash asks Barb for the phone number at the sorority house, and she tells him its Fellatio-20880. ""It's a new exchange, FE"" she explains. Nash, who apparently does not know the meaning of the word fellatio, writes it down and thanks her.Back at the sorority house, Mrs. Mac tells Jess that Clare is missing, so Jess goes to see Chris while he is at hockey practice. Chris is furious when Jess tells him that the police are not taking it seriously because they think she's shacked up somewhere with him.Peter performs his audition and fails miserably, distraught about the news Jess has given him. The instructors who listen to the recital are shocked that he cannot seem to hit the right notes, and later he destroys the piano after they've gone.Chris and Jess appear at the police station and Chris angrily lashes out at Sgt. Nash for having a big mouth (meaning his suggestion that Clare was shacked up with him). Lt. Fuller (John Saxon) overhears and becomes interested in the case--he has already been taking another missing person report from a distraught mother named Mrs. Quaife, whose 13-year-old daughter Janice has suddenly disappeared while on her way home from school.Mr. Harrison has dinner with Phyl, Barb, and Mrs. Mac at the sorority house, but Barb is extremely drunk and launches into a vulgar tirade that ends with her lashing out at the others. Barb feels guilty because she was careless to Clare, and she says the others think her disappearance is Barb's fault. Barb's curt suggestion that Clare might be dead shocks Mr. Harrison, and Phyl reacts angrily, telling Barb to go to bed. Barb goes upstairs and leaves them alone. Meanwhile, Jess and Chris come back to the house and tell the others about Janice Quaife's disappearance. A search is underway, and Phyl and Mr. Harrison join them. Mrs. Mac tells them that she's leaving for her sisters house and may not be there when they return. When Jess leaves, Mrs. Mac packs her bags and calls a cab, but she is distracted by sounds from the attic: the killer lures her into the attic by making sounds like the cat. When Mrs. Mac opens the attic door, he swings a large hook at her, designed to pull things up into the attic crawlspace. The hook impales her under her chin and hangs her. Outside, the cabbie becomes impatient and leaves.The extensive search of the park turns up a body: Janice Quaife. Jess rushes back to the house, where she receives another frightening phone call from the killer. Again he uses multiple voices and reenacts some weird scenario involving naughty Billy and baby Agnes. This time, Jess calls the police to report the obscene phone calls. As she talks to Sgt. Nash, a figure approaches her from behind and startles her--it is Peter, who has been napping in the house while waiting for Jess to return. Nash does not take Jess's report seriously, although Mr. Harrison is sitting near him in the police station and overhears him talking to Jess about the calls. He and Phyl and Chris tell Lt. Fuller about it, and Lt. Fuller angrily scolds Nash for being so inept.Meanwhile, Peter proposes to Jess. He would like to quit the conservatory and marry Jess and be a father to her child. Jess, however, refuses. She does not want to get married or have a child yet, as she has things she wants to accomplish first. Peter becomes hurt and angry, telling Jess that she's talking about killing their baby as if it's like having a wart removed. Jess becomes frightened by his mounting hostility, and tells Peter to leave.Just as Peter is walking out, Phyl arrives with Lt. Fuller and a phone company rep named Graham, who puts a tap on the house phone. Fuller notices that Peter seemed angry, and he questions Jess about it. He also looks around Clare's room and asks more questions about her. Graham asks if there is another phone in the house and Fuller tells him that it is a private line belonging to Mrs. Mac and that there have been no obscene phone calls on it, so they don't tap it. Fuller tells Jess that he'll be listening in on all of her phone conversations from the station, and Graham tells her to keep the caller on the line for as long as possible so that he can trace the call. Fuller has also left an officer in a squad car outside to watch the house.When he leaves, Phyl begins crying and tells Jess that she's sure Clare is dead. Tired and emotionally exhausted, she goes to bed, and Jess waits for another phone call. Meanwhile, the killer goes into Barb's room and watches her sleeping. Barb, who has asthma, suddenly suffers an attack, and Jess rushes to her aid with an inhaler. Barb tells her that she had a nightmare about a stranger coming into her room. Barb goes back to sleep, and Jess is distracted by a group of Christmas carolers at the front door. The singing masks the sounds of Barb's murder; the killer returns and stabs her to death using a glass ornament near her bed.The carolers are suddenly rushed off by a concerned parent who has just found out about the murder of the little girl in the park. Jess hears the phone ringing, and it's the killer. He wails at her in a strange voice, and says ""It's just like having a wart removed!"" before hanging up. Jess is shocked; these are words she used in private to Peter. Lt. Fuller picks up on this but Jess denies that it has any significance. Phyl comes back downstairs and Jess tells her about what just happened; Phyl seems to not think the killer could possibly be Peter, and neither does Jess, but she is not sure. Peter himself calls then, and begs Jess not to kill the baby. This conversation doesn't last long enough to trace, either, but Fuller calls to ask Jess about what they were talking about. Jess admits she's pregnant, and that Peter objects to an abortion, and Fuller seems to think that Peter could be the caller after all. Jess, however, has a revelation: Peter was here at the house with her when one of the calls came through, so it couldnt be Peter calling. Fuller is still suspicious, and he requests Peters records from the Dean of Admissions. He goes to the conservatory and finds the piano violently smashed.Jess is convinced that she can now rule out Peter as a suspect, and both she and Phyl are relieved. They have a brief laugh after they are startled by two bumbling men from town who are out looking for the killer. Phyl and Jess go around the house locking all the doors and windows, when Phyl goes into Barb's room. Just inside the door, someone whispers ""Agnes!"" and the door slams shut. Jess tries to find Phyl but the phone rings; its the killer again. This time Jess keeps him on the phone long enough for Graham to trace the calls--they are coming from 6 Belmont Street, the same address as the sorority house itself. Nash radios Fuller with the news, and Fuller realizes the calls are coming from the house mother's phone. He tries to radio the policeman parked outside the sorority house, but the cop is now dead, his throat slit by the killer. Fuller radios Nash and tells him to call Jess and warn her to get out of there, without letting on that the killer is in the house with her. Nash, of course, is unable to do this; when Jess tells him she's going to go upstairs and get Phyl and Barb, Nash admits that the calls are coming from inside the sorority house itself.Jess is terrified, and she screams out for Phyl and Barb over and over again. The house is silent. Instead of leaving, Jess gets a poker from the fireplace and goes upstairs. In Barb's room, she finds the bodies of both Phyl and Barb on the bed. From the crack in the door, Jess sees the killer's eye watching her. ""Agnes, its me, Billy! Don't tell what we did!"" he whispers. Jess slams the door on him and runs. Howling in rage and pain, the killer chases after her. With no time to unlock the front door, Jess heads for the cellar. The killer catches her hair as she passes the stairs, but Jess is able to break free and bolt the cellar door behind her just in time. Eventually the maniac stops pounding on the door, and Jess hears sounds as if he is going out the front door. Unsure, she remains in the cellar. Through the basement windows, Jess can see someone prowling around the house. Unable to gain admittance, the figure seems to spot Jess in the cellar; it is Peter. He calls out to her but Jess ignores him. Peter breaks a window and enters the basement with her. ""Whats the matter, Jess?"" he asks, as she approaches her. He will not be dissuaded.Outside, Fuller arrives with other policemen close behind, and they find the patrolman dead in his car. Hearing Jess screaming from inside the house, they break in. By the time they reach the basement, they find Jess and Peter lying together; they appear to both be dead, but Jess stirs. She has killed Peter with the fire poker.A doctor gives Jess a sedative and she is sleeping, although the house is bustling with activity. Fuller, unable to question her, hypothesizes about the case, convinced that Peter was the killer. Mr. Harrison suddenly goes into shock. The doctor intervenes and wants to take Mr. Harrison to the hospital. Chris leaves with them, and so do the other police officers, leaving Jess alone and unconscious with a guard in front of the house. After they leave, the house is silent, and the attic door opens. The bodies of Clare and Mrs. Mac are still up there, unnoticed by anybody yet. The killer climbs down out of the attic, saying ""Agnes, its me, Billy!"" As the camera slowly pulls away from the house, we see the lone police officer on the front porch, smoking a cigarette. Suddenly the phone begins to ring, just as it did after all the murders that came before."
tt0071230,"['Comedy', 'Western']","In the American Old West of 1874, construction on a new railroad led by Lyle (Burton Gilliam) runs into quicksand. The route has to be changed, which will require it to go through Rock Ridge, a frontier town where everyone has the last name of ""Johnson"" (including a ""Howard Johnson"", a ""Dr. Samuel Johnson"", a ""Van Johnson"" and an ""Olson N. Johnson""). The conniving State Attorney General Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) wants to buy the land along the new railroad route cheaply by driving out the townspeople. He sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky assistant Taggart (Slim Pickens), to scare them away, prompting the townsfolk to demand that Governor William J. Le Petomane (Mel Brooks) appoint a new sheriff. The Attorney General persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to select Bart (Cleavon Little), a black railroad worker who was about to be hanged. (Bart had hit Taggart in the head with a shovel after Taggart ignored him and his black friend sinking in quicksand, deciding to save their handcar instead.) Lamarr believes a black lawman will so offend the townspeople that they will either abandon Rock Ridge or lynch the new sheriff, with either result paving the way for him to take over the town.With his quick wits and the assistance of drunken gunslinger Jim (Gene Wilder), also known as ""The Waco Kid"" (""I must have killed more men than Cecil B. DeMille""), Bart works to overcome the townsfolk's hostile reception. He defeats and befriends Mongo (Alex Karras), an immensely strong, slow-thinking (but surprisingly philosophical) henchman sent by Taggart and Lyle to kill Bart, and then beats German seductress-for-hire Lili von Shtupp (Madeline Kahn) at her own game. Lamarr is furious that his plans keep failing and decides to destroy Rock Ridge with a newly recruited and diverse army of thugs (which Lamarr characterized as ideally consisting of ""rustlers, cutthroats, murderers, bounty hunters, desperadoes, mugs, pugs, thugs, nitwits, half-wits, dimwits, vipers, snipers, con men, Indian agents, Mexican bandits, muggers, buggerers, bushwhackers, hornswagglers, horse thieves, bull dykes, train robbers, bank robbers, ass kickers, shit kickers and Methodists"").Bart now has 24 hours to come up with a ""brilliant plan to save our town"". He gathers the town, along with the railroad workers, 3 miles east of Rock Ridge to build a fake town as a diversion. The workers labor all night to complete their task. The sun rises on a fake town that's a perfect replica, down to the orange roof on Howard Johnson's outhouse. Bart realizes the town has no people in it, so it won't fool Lamarr's villains. Bart orders the townspeople to make ""exact replicas of themselves,"" and leaves with Jim and Mongo to execute a plan that will slow the villains ""to a crawl"". The three construct a tollbooth labeled ""Le Petomane Thruway"", requiring Taggart's crew to pay 10¢ each to pass on their horses. (""Now what will that asshole think of next?"" snaps Taggart.) Since no one in the raiding party has any change, Taggart sends someone back to town to ""get a shitload of dimes"".Once through the tollbooth, Lamarr's villains attack the fake town populated with dummies, which Bart boobytrapped with several dynamite bombs. Bart tries setting off the bombs but is unsuccessful as the detonator does not work. Jim is given the task of exploding the bombs, and fires his pistol at them. After the bombs explode, launching villains skyward, the Rock Ridgers attack the villains.The resulting fight between the townsfolk and Lamarr's army of thugs breaks the fourth wall.... literally. The fight spills out from the Warner Bros. film lot into a neighboring musical set being directed by Buddy Bizarre (Dom DeLuise), then into the studio commissary, where a pie fight ensues. Taggart is knocked out when Mongo smashes his head on a cash register, and the fight finally pours out into the surrounding streets (specifically, Olive Avenue in Burbank). The citizens of Rock Ridge chase the villains back to town to destroy them, but Lamarr takes a taxi..... ""off this picture."" He arrives at Grauman's Chinese Theatre to watch the ""premiere"" of Blazing Saddles. Unfortunately, he sees on the movie screen that Bart has arrived outside the theatre. Bart ends up killing Lamarr by shooting him in the groin. Bart and Jim then go into the theater to watch the end of the film.The film ends with Bart leaving Rock Ridge, much to the sadness, of the townspeople and the railroad workers, for his work there is done. He intends to fight injustice in other parts of the world, which the townspeople and the railroad workers dismiss as ""bullshit"", and Bart admits it's simply getting dull around there. As he rides off, he finds Jim (who still has the popcorn that he bought at the theater), and the two decide to go off to ""nowhere special."" They then hand in their horses to the film crew horse wranglers, and ride off (in a limousine) into the sunset."

Two men inform tell her that her father, a powerful Mexican landowner known only as ""El Jefe,"" expects to see her. El Jefe asks his daughter to her who the father of her child is. It isn't until his bodyguards break her arm, that she finally answers, ""Alfredo García."" El Jefe then offers $1 million to whoever brings him the head of Alfredo García.The search for García progresses as different people go across several Mexican places asking for anyone who has seen him. In Mexico City, a pair of business suit-clad, dispassionate hit men, Sappensly and Quill, enter a saloon and encounter Bennie, a retired U.S. Army officer who makes a meager living as a piano player and bar manager. The men ask about García, believing they will have more luck getting answers out of a fellow American. Bennie plays dumb, saying the name is familiar but he doesn't know who García is.It turns out that everyone in the bar knows who García is they simply don't know where he is. Bennie goes to meet his girlfriend, Elita, who is a prostitute, at a big hotel. Elita admits to having been with García, who had professed his love for her, something Bennie refuses to do. Elita informs him that García died in a drunk-driving accident the previous week.Excited by the possibility of making money by simply digging up the body, Bennie goes to Sappensly and Quill in the hotel room of the man who hired them, El Jefe's business associate Max, and makes a deal for $10,000 for Garcia's head, plus a $200 advance for expenses. Bennie convinces Elita to go on a road trip with him to visit García's grave, claiming that he only wants proof that Garcia is in fact dead and no longer a threat to their relationship.En route, Bennie proposes, promising that their future will soon change, and she can retire from her cleaning job. Elita warns Bennie against trying to upset their status quo. While having a picnic, Bennie and Elita are accosted by two bikers, who pull guns and decide to rape Elita. Bennie seems unsure how to react. Elita agrees to have sex with the bikers if they spare Bennie's life, then goes off with one of them. He rips off her shirt, lets her slap him twice, slaps her back, then walks away. Bennie knocks the second biker unconscious, takes his gun and finds Elita about to make love with the first biker. Bennie shoots him dead and kills the second biker as well.Bennie confesses to Elita his plan to decapitate García's corpse and sell the head for money. A disgusted Elita, still shaken from what has just happened, begs Bennie to give up this quest and return to Mexico City, where they can be married and live a modest life of relative peace. Bennie again refuses, although he agrees to marry Elita in the church of the town where García is buried. They find Garcia's grave, but when he opens the coffin, Bennie is struck from behind with his shovel by an unseen assailant. He wakes up to find himself half-buried in the grave with Elita, who is dead. García's corpse is then revealed to have been decapitated.Bennie learns from villagers that his assailants are driving a station wagon. He catches up with the men after they blow out a tire. Bennie shoots them, searches their car, and claims García's head. Stopping at a roadside restaurant, he packs the sack containing the head with ice to preserve it for the journey home. Bennie begins addressing the head as if García were still alive, first blaming Alfredo for Elita's death and then conceding that both of them probably loved her equally.Bennie is ambushed by members of García's family. They re-claim the head and are about to kill Bennie when they are interrupted by the arrival of Sappensly and Quill. The hit men pretend to ask for directions. Quill produces a sub-machine gun and murders most of the family, but is fatally shot by one of them. As Sappensly sorrowfully looks at Quill's corpse, Bennie asks: ""Do I get paid?"" Sappensly turns to shoot, but Bennie kills him.

Feigning willingness to surrender the head for his $10,000, Bennie reveals he is no longer motivated by money; he says Alfredo was a friend of his and demands to know why Max and the others want his head so badly. He also blames Elita's death on the bounty and intends to kill everyone involved. Several men pull guns, but Bennie manages to evade fire and kill them all. He takes a business card from the desk with El Jefe's address on it.After finishing the baptism for his new grandchild, El Jefe greets Bennie as a hero and gives him a briefcase containing the promised million-dollar bounty. Bennie calmly relates how many people died for García's head, including his beloved. El Jefe responds apathetically, telling Bennie to take his money and throw the head to the pigs on the way out.

tt0071275,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","Four ruthless criminals wait outside the gates of a pharmaceutical company to steal the pay wages from an armored truck which will arrive at the gated complex. Upon the truck's arrival, the heavily armed thieves hold up the truck, killing a number of people in the process. But during the getaway, the thieves car is riddled with bullets from the company's security guards which kill the getaway driver, and damage the car so that it's leaking fuel. The clean-cut, cunning leader of the group, known only as Doc (Maurice Poli), and his two vicious and scruffy cohorts, the knife-wielding Blade (Aldo Caponi) and the hulking seven-foot tall Thirty-Two (Luigi Montefiori) are overjoyed at the stolen cash they now have. But when their car stalls in a downtown part of Rome, they are forced to flee on foot into an underground car park, persuaded by the police. The criminals grab two women as hostages, and when Blade accidentally kills one, the police, seeing the other female hostage Maria (Lea Lander) in danger, back away, allowing the criminals to steal her car and make an escape from the car park.Back on the street, Doc knows that its only a matter of time before a description of their new getaway car will reach the authorities, which will make it impossible for them to get out of the city. But the situation is resolved when they stop at a red traffic light, they hijack the car in front of them. The middle-aged driver of the other car, Riccardo (Riccardo Cucciolla) protests that he has to get his young child, a small, deathly-pail little boy wrapped up in a blanket, to the hospital. But the criminals, plus their female hostage Maria, force Riccardo to drive them out of the city.Once outside the city, Doc forces Riccardo to drive onto a local tollway to Naples which will lead them to their hideout outside that city. But aware that the police will be surveying the toll road for them, Doc forces Riccardo to turn around and exit the toll road, in which they decide to take a few secondary, but slower, roads to get to their hideout.During most the long road journey, Maria cannot stop herself from shaking and quaking with fear, which annoys Blade and Thirty-Two. Riccardo on the other hand, despite being somewhat unnerved and intimidated, takes what's happening to him very calmly. Doc, the most civilized of the criminals, is barely able to keep Blade and Thirty-Two in line who are both frequently fondling Maria who continues to tremble constantly. At a traffic construction site, Doc forces the group to roll their windows up, which attracts some attention for in the middle of a hot summer day, makes some of the motorists in front and behind them to question. But Doc has them roll their windows back down when it makes is look they might be made, and the group continues on.A little later, Maria ask Doc to pull the car over so she can relive herself. But she takes the opportunity to try to escape. She is perused by Blade and Thirty-Two, who chase to a farmhouse, which is unoccupied. Once Maria is re-captured, Blade and Thirty-Two torture the woman, both physically and mentally. Since she used the fact that she has to relive herself as a excuse to try to escape, they force her to urinate in front of them for punishment.Back on a main highway, Riccardo asks Doc if can pull into a rest stop for food and supplies, with Thirty-Two accompanying him, Riccardo buys some sandwiches, soda pop, while Thirty-Two buys a bottle of scotch. When a random woman at the rest area recognizes Riccardo, he manages to shake her off by saying that he's going on a picnic in the countryside with some friends.Back on the road, Thirty-Two becomes very intoxicated from the bottle of liquor he bought, and his actions begin to draw attention to the car from the other motorists. Doc and Blade try to control him, but he gets more and more out of control, and he attempts to rape Maria. Rather than risk attracting the attention of the highway police, Doc suddenly shoots Thirty-Two in the neck. Blade is completely shaken by this, but understands that Doc had no other choice. Thirty-Two does not die, but is completely helpless and immobile. Blade tries to help his friend by banding the bullet wound, but Doc knows that Thirty-Two is as good as dead.Soon after this incident, Riccardo tells them that they need to stop to get gas. However, when they finally reach a rural Esso filling station, the elderly attendant (Francesco Ferrini) tells them that he's on his hour break and won't help them for at least another 20 minutes. Doc, in a hurry to complete their journey, attempts to threaten the old man, who instead pulls a gun on Doc telling them that he was robbed the previous year and cannot be intimidated. Thinking quickly, Blade forces Maria to smooth things over by pleading with the attendant to come out and fill their car so they can get the comatose little boy to a hospital. The old man quickly relents and comes out to fill the car. But soon, another complication arises with the arrival of an overly cheerful young woman (Eriak Dario) who shows up at the station claiming that her car has broken down a kilometer away and needs assistance. Seeing the group, she pressures Doc to give her a ride to the next town where she is heading. When the woman opens the side door to the car, Thirty-Two's hand, covered with his own blood, slumps into view, the woman fails to see this, but the attendant does. Rather than risk a scene, Doc allows the woman to come along with them, and they drive off, with none of them knowing that the attendant saw the near-death Thirty-Two. The old man returns to his office with a shrug.The presence of this female hitchhiker is clearly annoying to Doc and everybody else since she cannot stop talking or ranting about how hot the day is and of the countryside. Ironically enough, the woman is also named Maria. But Maria the hitchhiker is a little too vivacious and outgoing, and her manner clearly has a grating effect on both the criminals and hostages. Maria the hitchhiker is completely oblivious to her situation and when she inadvertently removes the blanket covering Thirty-Two's neck, she notices the bullet wound. Blade kills the annoying hitchhiker by stabbing her in the neck with his signature knife. Doc forces Riccardo to pull over so they can dispose of the body. As the hitchhiker's body is thrown unceremoniously off a cliff, Riccardo helps Blade carry the still breathing Thirty-Two down the bottom of the cliff where Blade shoots his mortally wounded friend in the head to put him out of his misery.The group finally reaches their destination: a ruined villa just south of Naples where Doc has stashed a back-up car, carrying the appropriate papers that will enable him and Blade to leave the country. Riccardo and Maria are elated, but Doc reveals that he has no intention of letting them go for the hostages must be killed to secure their escape. Riccardo persuades Doc to let the little boy, who has been in a sedative-induced sleep for the whole duration, live. But Doc refuses and orders Riccardo to remove the little boy from the car. However, as Riccardo does so, he pulls out a gun hidden all this time in the child's blanket and shoots and kills both Doc and Blade, who fires off his machine gun fatally injuring Maria before expiring. With the tires of the car flat from the bullet hits, Riccardo moves the child to Doc's getaway car, and promptly steals the stolen money still clutched in Blade's fingers, and drives off.At a nearby rest stop, Riccardo, now alone, pulls over to make a telephone call. When a woman on the other end picks up, the film's big twist is when Riccardo says: ""It's me again. I have something important to tell you. Yes, it's about your son. Yes, he's right here with me. Now, if you ever want to see him again... alive... it will cost you 30 million lire."" Riccardo tells the sobbing boy's mother that he will call back to give her further instructions, and then hangs up. Riccardo casualty strolls back to his car, cheerily greeting a passing stranger on along the way. Upon opening the truck, the kidnapped child is shown, lying completely immobile as he has throughout the film. Riccardo gives the boy another shot of drugs to keep him sedated, closes the car truck, and drives away."

tt0071315,"['Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","Set in 1937 Los Angeles, a private investigator named Jake ""J.J."" Gittes (Nicholson) is hired to spy on Hollis Mulwray, the chief engineer for the city's water department. The woman hiring Gittes claims to be Evelyn Mulwray, Hollis' wife. For unknown reasons, Mulwray spends considerable time looking at dry riverbeds and water outlets. Mulwray is photographed while having a heated argument with an elderly man on the street. Gittes photographs Mulwray from a roof top when he kisses a young blonde, and the photo is published in the newspaper the next day, causing a scandal. After the story is published, Gittes is visited by the real Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray, who threatens to sue him for defamation.Gittes uncovers information that despite a serious drought and an expensive proposal to build a new dam, the Water and Power Department is dumping fresh water into the ocean at night. The dam project is opposed by Mulwray himself, who cites a potential disaster because of weak geological formations in the rock where the dam is to be constructed -- Mulwray had previously supported the building of another dam that had failed due to similar geological conditions. When he addresses a public hearing on the project, which Gittes attends, Mulwray is ridiculed by several farmers, one of whom leads a flock of sheep into the room, who want the reservoir and water the dam will provide. Gittes also meets with Mulwray's successor, Yelburton, who tells Jake that the Dept. of Water has been diverting some of the water supply to farmers in the San Fernando Valley because of the drought. He says specifically that there's always some run-off into various smaller waterways and drain channels.Jake goes to Mulwray's mansion to speak to him but is only able to talk to Evelyn Mulwray. While he waits for her, Mulwray's Japanese gardener cleans a small decorative pond, pulling out a clump of grass and tossing it aside. He casually says ""bad for the glass"" in broken English, a comment that Jake dismisses. Jake notices a shiny object in the pool and tries to retrieve it, stopping when Evelyn appears. She tells him that Mulwray usually takes afternoon walks at a reservoir and that he should look for him there.Gittes goes to find Mulwray at the reservoir -- bluffing his way past the checkpoint with one of Yelburton's business cards -- but instead finds the police and firemen hauling Mulwray's body out of the reservoir. They believe Mulwray died from drowning. Gittes used to work with the lead investigator, Lt. Lou Escobar. When the police interview Evelyn Mulwray about her husband's death, they assume she hired Gittes, and Gittes corroborates the lie for her. She thanks him and hires him to investigate what happened to her husband. Later, at the county coroner's department, Gittes learns from the coroner that Mulwray's lungs were filled with salt water, although he had been found in a freshwater reservoir. Gittes also learns that a local drunk was found dead from drowning in a dry riverbed that Mulwray had been inspecting.Later that night Gittes climbs the secure fence around the reservoir and, after he is shot at by an unseen shooter, is nearly drowned when the culvert he is hiding in has a sudden rush of fast-moving water. Two water department security thugs detain him; a large man named Claude Mulvihill and a short thug (a cameo by Roman Polanski), who slashes Jake's nose for being a ""very nosy fella."" They threaten to cut off the rest of his nose if he comes snooping around again. Gittes, forced to wear a large and ridiculous bandage, receives a call from Ida Sessions, the woman who originally impersonated Evelyn Mulwray. She admits she was hired to trick Gittes, but refuses to come to his office. She tells him to read that day's obituaries, saying he'll find ""one of those people"". At the water department, Gittes sees photographs of the elderly man Mulwray quarreled with a few days before his death; the man is Noah Cross (John Huston), Evelyn Mulwray's father. He used to own the water utility in partnership with Mulwray, but Cross ended his association with the department when the partners sold it to the city, as Mulwray had long desired. He speaks briefly with Yelburton again and tells him that he suspects Mulwray was murdered. Yelburton is incredulous and Jake tells him he doesn't want to see Yelburton accused or charged with the crime but wants to nail the people behind it.Cross invites Jake to lunch at his home and hires Jake to find the blond girl Mulwray had been seeing, saying that she might know what happened to him and that he'd like to comfort her if he can. Cross hints that Jake might be sleeping with Evelyn in addition to gouging her in his investigation of Mulwray's murder but relents when he sees Jake's resolve.Gittes goes to the Hall of Records and looks in a large plat book of the valley. He learns that a considerable portion of the valley has been bought up in the past few months by a few new land owners who have purchased large tracts of land. When the attendant in the room refuses to let Jake borrow the book, Jake surreptitiously tears the column out of the book and pockets it.Acting on another tip from Sessions, Gittes begins to unravel an intricate scandal involving LA's fresh water supply. Gittes first travels to an orange farm to talk with the owner about how his land is being irrigated. As he drives around he is shot at by the farmer and a few of his farmhands and crashes his car into a tree. Jake is dragged from his car, beaten and searched. The farmer explains that the Department of Water & Power has been harassing him by sending agents to run him off his land and poison the water in his wells, suspecting that Jake might be one of them. While he tries to show the farmer documentation of his investigation, the farmhands claim that Mulwray is responsible for harassment of late and attack Jake. When Jake tries to fight back, he's knocked unconscious. He wakes up to find that the farmer and his wife have called Evelyn, who has come to the farm.While they drive back to LA, Jake explains the scandal to her: her father and his partners have been forcing farmers in the rural areas surrounding the city off their land so they can buy it cheap, after which a newly-built (and controversial) dam and water system would start redirecting much of L.A.'s water supply to that land, dramatically increasing its real estate potential and value.Since Cross wants no record of such transactions, he has partnered with a retirement home community, using the identities of the eldest residents within (one of whom is mentioned in the obituary column): they would legally, but unknowingly, own the land. Jake, having matched one of the obituary names to one of the names in the list he stole from the plat book, has Evelyn drive him to the retirement home where they pose as a married couple trying to find a place for Jake's father to live. The host tells them they can tour the facility. They come across an activities board with the names of the people from the plat book. Jake talks to a group of women working on a quilt. One of the pieces of fabric they've sewn into the quilt is a small flag bearing the emblem of the Albacore Club, the yacht club owned by Noah Cross. Jake is confronted by the host who has figured out Jake's ruse. The man takes him out to the lobby where Mulvihill is waiting. Jake tells Evelyn to bring the car around and then severely beats Mulvihill and barely escapes when the short thug who slashed his nose shows up.Back at Evelyn's house, Gittes and Evelyn share a romantic interlude. As they lie on the bed afterward, Evelyn asks Jake about his past as a cop. He tells her he worked in Chinatown and was responsible for a woman ""being hurt"", possibly killed because of his actions. The phone rings and Evelyn has a cryptic conversation with someone, then informs Jake that she has to leave for a little while. She gravely asks him to trust her and wait for her to return.Gittes takes Mulwray's car and follows Evelyn to a middle-class house and sees Mulwray's girlfriend crying. He confronts Evelyn as she leaves, who claims the young woman is her sister, who was distraught because she had just learned about Mulwray's death in the newspaper. Later that night, Jake receives a call at home from a detective named Loach, Escobar's partner, telling him to meet him at a specific address. When he gets there he finds that Ida Sessions is murdered and Escobar and Loach are waiting for him. When Jake asks how they knew to call him Escobar shows Jake his phone number written near the phone. Escobar also points out that he knows the coroner's report proves that salt water was found in Mulwray's lungs even though the body was found in a freshwater reservoir, a fact that Jake had discovered earlier but withheld. He demands that Jake turn over any incriminating photos that may reveal Mulwray's murderer's identity. Escobar's chief suspect is Evelyn herself.Under pressure from Escobar threatening to revoke his PI's license, Jake returns to Evelyn's mansion looking for her. Evelyn's Japanese gardener is working in the backyard and drops a minor comment about ""salt water being bad for the *grass*"". The man's accent had masked over the actual word he was using to describe the problem when he'd said ""bad for the glass."" Jake has the man fish out the shiny object he'd noticed in the pool before: it's a pair of eyeglasses.Gittes confronts Evelyn at the small house where she'd been keeping the young girl. Evelyn reveals that the blond girl, Katherine, is both her sister and her daughter, born from an incestuous relationship she had with her father years before. Gittes asks Evelyn if her father raped her and she shakes her head no. It remains unclear whether the act was consensual or not. It is apparent also that Evelyn resents her father for taking advantage of her in a relationship considered unnatural. Gittes then chooses to help Evelyn escape. Evelyn also states that the eyeglasses Jake found in her back yard pond could not have been her husband's because they are bifocals. Gittes arranges for the two women to flee to Mexico on a fishing boat owned by another of Jake's clients and instructs Evelyn to meet him at her butler's address in Chinatown.Evelyn leaves, and Cross arrives with Mulvihill under the pretext that Gittes has found the girl; however, Gittes confronts Cross with the accusation of murder and the glasses. Cross had Mulwray drowned in the saltwater pond at his own house and lost his own glasses in the pond during the act. Jake asks Cross about the water scandal; Cross blithely tells him that he plans to create a community in the desert with an abundant fresh water supply. The real estate revenues from the sales of the land will generate many millions of dollars for him. Cross considers the plan a way of buying the future, essentially insuring that his family will reap the benefits from such a deal for many years. When Jake pointedly asks Cross about the relationship with his daughter, Cross confidently says ""Most people never have to face the fact that, at the right time and the right place, they're capable of anything"". Cross then orders Mulvihill to seize the glasses, the only physical evidence Jake has and forces Gittes to take him to Evelyn's butler's address in Chinatown. When Gittes arrives at Evelyn's hiding place in Chinatown, the police are already there and arrest Gittes on conspiracy and withholding evidence. Jake vainly tries to explain Cross' plan to Escobar, who won't listen.Evelyn appears with her daughter, trying to drive away in her car. When Cross approaches Katherine, demanding custody of her, Evelyn pushes him back, shoots him in the arm with a small pistol and starts her car. As Evelyn is driving away, the police open fire and Evelyn is shot and killed. Cross clutches the hysterical Katherine, taking her out of the car, as a devastated Gittes is comforted by his associates, who urge him to walk away: ""Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.""The plot is based in part on real events that formed the California Water Wars, in which William Mulholland acted on behalf of Los Angeles interests to secure water rights in the Owens Valley."

Using three separate microphones, Caul and his associates follow the couple around a park. Later, he pieces together a conversation that clearly indicates the two are in a relationship and that they fear being found out by the Director.Caul is a secretive, almost paranoid individual. He alienates his assistant, Stan (John Cazale), because he won't teach him more about audio surveillance, and his girlfriend, Amy (Teri Garr), because he won't share with her details about his career or personal life. He also refuses to hand over the tapes of Ann and Marc to the Director's assistant, Martin (Harrison Ford). The Director had specified that the tapes were to be turned over only to him. Martin protests but Caul keeps the tapes.Caul becomes increasingly concerned that, were he to turn the tapes over to the Director, that some harm would come to Ann and Marc. On the tapes, Marc can be heard to say ""He'd kill us if he had the chance."" When he worked on the East Coast, Caul had participated in a surveillance that led to the deaths of two persons. He worries that this might happen again, and goes to church to confess his sins.After Amy breaks off their relationship, Caul attends a surveillance convention. Martin also attends, and Caul confronts him and orders Martin to stop following him. He learns that Stan has gone to work for Moran (Alan Garfield), a Detroit-based surveillance expert looking to expand to the West Coast. Moran demonstrates to convention goers a new remote audio system that turns any telephone into a live microphone. Although Caul persuades Stan not to work for Moran after the convention is over, Moran is effusive in his praise for Caul. Lonely and enjoying the positive attention, Caul lets his guard down and takes Moran, Stan and several others back to his workroom for a post-convention party. Among the partygoers is Meredith (Elizabeth McRae), a showgirl who worked at Moran's convention booth. Meredith openly flirts with Caul and in a private moment, Caul opens up to her about his troubles with Amy. This conversation is recorded by Moran, who had earlier planted a bug on Caul. Caul is outraged and kicks everybody out. Meredith stays, helps Caul into bed, undresses herself and sleeps with him. Caul has a dream in which he pursues Ann through the fog, telling her about how he nearly died as a child. In this dream, he warns Ann that the Director plans to kill her. ""I'm not afraid of death,"" he tells her as she disappears into the mist, ""but I am afraid of murder.""When Caul awakens in the morning, he discovers both Meredith and the tapes are gone. Frustrated and angry, he returns home and tries to call the Director. Caul has lied to many people that he doesn't have a home telephone and is surprised when Martin calls him back at home. Martin tells him that he took the tapes and delivered them to the Director. Caul should come to the office to pick up his fee ($15,000). Caul does as asked, and finds the seething Director (Robert Duvall) listening to the conversation. The Director curtly dismisses Caul after paying him.Disturbed, Caul goes to the hotel that Ann and Marc mentioned as meeting place in their conversation. He rents an adjoining room and inserts a microphone through the wall to listen to the conversation. He hears shouting. Rushing to the balcony, he sees bloody hand prints on the glass partition. Appalled and frightened, he collapses in his own room. Upon reviving, he breaks into the room Marc and Ann had rented. The room seems orderly, but the toilet is running. He gives it a flush and blood wells out.Caul goes to see the Director but security blocks his way. On the street, he is surprised to see Ann sitting in an idling car. A newspaper headline informs him that the Director has been killed in a car accident. Ann now controls the Director's company. Later, as Ann, Marc and Martin try to escape reporters asking them about an inquiry into the Director's death, they notice Caul watching them. Caul realizes that the bloody hand he saw in the hotel was the Director's; Marc's statement that the Director would kill them if he had the chance was a rationalization of their decision to kill him.Back in his apartment, Caul sits alone, playing his saxophone to his favorite jazz records. His phone rings. When he answers, no one is there. He hangs up and resumes playing. It rings again; this time, Martin tells him that Ann and Marc know he has deduced what happened, and that they will be listening to him. Martin then plays back a recording of Caul's saxophone playing. Completely consumed by paranoia and forgetful of Moran's demonstration at the convention, Caul demolishes his apartment looking for the bug. Unable to find it, he resumes playing his saxophone."

As they rush to the prison, the two are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police. Meanwhile, Randy and another cellmate named Pappy manage to escape from inside the prison and wait for Sampson and the Preacherman to help them get out. While waiting for them, Randy unwillingly listens to Pappy tell a story about three guys that resemble and Randy and his friends. Pappy's story is told in animation set against live-action background photos and footage.Brother Rabbit, Brother Bear, and Preacher Fox are forced to pack up and leave their Southern settings after the bank mortgages their home and sells it to a man who turns it into a brothel. The trio moves to Harlem, ""home to every black man"". When they arrive, Rabbit, Bear, and Fox find that it isn't all that it's made out to be. They encounter a con man named Simple Savior, a phony revolutionary leader who purports to be the ""cousin"" of ""Black Jesus"", and that he gives his followers ""the strength to kill whites"". In a flashy stage performance in his ""church"", Savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppressionrepresented by images of John Wayne, Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon, before asking his parishioners for ""donations"". When Rabbit attempts to turn the crowd, Savior tries to have him killed. After Rabbit tricks his would-be murderers (in a paraphrase of the story of Br'er Rabbit and the briar patch), he and Bear kill Savior. This allows Rabbit to take over Savior's racket, putting him in line to become the head of all organized crime in Harlem. But first, he has to get rid of a few other opponents. Savior's former partners tell Rabbit that if he can't kill his opponents, then they'll kill him instead.Rabbit first goes up against Madigan, a virulently racist and homophobic white police officer and bagman for the Mafia, who demonstrates his contempt for African Americans in various ways, including a refusal to bathe before an anticipated encounter with them (he believes they're not worth it). When Madigan finds out that Rabbit has been taking his payoffs, he and his cohorts, Ruby and Bobby, are led to a nightclub called ""The Cottontail"". A black stripper distracts him while an LSD sugar cube is dropped into his drink. Madigan, while under the influence of his spiked drink, is then maneuvered into a sexual liaison with a stereotypically effeminate gay man, and then shoved into women's clothing representative of the mammy archetype, adorned in blackface, and finally shoved out the back of the club where he discovers that Ruby and Bobby are dead. Then, while recovering from his delirium of being drugged, shoots his gun around randomly, and is shot to death by the police after shooting one of them.[3]Rabbit's final target is the Godfather who lives in the subway with his wife and gay sons. The contract for killing Rabbit is given to his only straight son Sonny. Showing up outside Rabbit's nightclub in blackface and clothing representative of minstrel show stereotypes, Sonny winds up shot multiple times by Rabbit before dying in an explosion caused by a car crash. His body is cremated and taken back home, where his mother weeps over his ashes. Bear becomes torn between staying with Rabbit, or starting a new, crime-free life. Bear decides to look for Fox in order to seek his advice. Upon arriving at Fox's newly acquired brothel, Bear is ""married"" to a girl he, Fox, and Rabbit met during the fight with Savior's men. Under the advisement of Fox, Bear becomes a boxer for the Mafia. During one of Bear's fights, Rabbit sets up a melting imitation of himself made out of tar.

tt0071396,"['Horror', 'contentRating', 'R']","A man runs frantically down a deserted residential street at night, from some unseen threat. A doorway in a walled-in yard opens, and a girl wordlessly allows the man to come in. He collapses next a swimming pool, exhausted, and the girl comes to his side, seemingly to help him. Instead, she suddenly produces a strait razor and slashes his throat.A vague female figure walks down a long hallway, while we hear her voice narrating. She is Arletty (Marianna Hill), confined to a mental institution. She warns of a town called Point Dune, where the moon turned blood red and caused some kind of change to come upon the residents. ""They'll take you one by one and no one will hear your scream!"" she says. The movie proceeds in flashback, with Arletty narrating occasionally in voice-over.Arletty explains that she was originally travelling to Point Dune to make contact with her father, a painter who lived and worked there in a beach house. He had stopped communicating with Arletty after a series of letters that became more and more bizarre, as he seemed threatened by some unexplained illness or madness. On her way to Point Dune, she stops for gas at an isolated rural service station, where she finds the lone attendant (Charles Dierkop) firing a gun into the darkness at some unseen target. He holsters the gun and comes to pump Arletty's gas, when a pickup truck driven by an odd looking albino man (Bennie Robinson) also pulls up. While refueling the truck, the attendant surreptitiously looks under a tarp in the back and discovers two dead bodies, one with the eyes ripped out and the other being the man from the beginning of the film with the slashed throat. He says nothing, but tries to get rid of Arletty quickly, sending her away without even paying for her gas. Some time after she leaves, the attendant is murdered inside the service station when a strange figure (Willard Huyck) suddenly leaps out of the car he's working on.Arletty goes to her father's house and finds it abandoned. The walls are elaborately decorated with eerie murals depicting life-size human figures, and Arletty finds a journal her father kept where he discusses a sickness he seems to be enduring that borders on madness. Desperate to make contact with someone who may know his whereabouts, she goes into town the next day to an art gallery that used to sell his work, only to find that they now claim they never sold his art. The gallery curator refers her to three people who he says were just in the gallery earlier that day also looking for her father, and Arletty locates them at a local motel. They are Thom (Michael Greer), Toni (Joy Bang), and Laura (Anitra Ford), and when Arletty enters their room, they are interviewing a local vagrant (Elisha Cook, Jr.), who relates a story passed on to him by his father about a time when the moon turned blood red and caused the locals to revert to savage acts of violence. Thom presses him to elaborate, but he becomes afraid and leaves hurriedly. Thom explains to Arletty that he is a foreign aristocrat, a collector of regional legends, and a fan of her father's work. He says he stopped by the gallery and they had his work displayed in the window, but refused to sell it to him, which contradicts the gallery attendant's statement that they never carried her father's work. After Arletty leaves, she's stopped by the vagrant, who warns her that if she encounters her father, she must burn him in order to avoid becoming his victim. The next day, Arletty awakens to find Thom and the two women are in her father's house with her. Thom explains that the old man was found dead later that day, seemingly eaten by animals, and all the local motels suddenly refused to rent them a room, so they had nowhere to go. Arletty allows them to stay, and Thom seems to take an interest in her, which causes Laura to become annoyed. She tells Toni that she's leaving, and after setting out on foot, a vehicle stops to offer her a ride. It's the same pickup truck driven by the albino, with a small group of men sitting in the back who are staring emotionless up at the sky. Laura decides to accept the ride, but changes her mind once the albino pulls a mouse out of his pocket and eats it alive. She asks to be let out, and she walks the rest of the way to town on foot. She finds the town deserted, and she follows a lone figure into a supermarket. Unable to attract the man's attention, she follows him through the market until she discovers a group of townsfolk gathered around a meat cooler, ravenously devouring the raw meat like animals. They suddenly notice her and chase her until they have her cornered, dragging her to the floor and eating her alive. The next day, Arletty is summoned by the police to identify her father's body, which has been discovered on the beach. Arletty is distraught, but behaving strangely. Toni becomes bored, and Thom sends her into town with the car so she can go to the movies. Back at the house, Arletty discovers that she is bleeding from her ear, and she has a strange experience where she burns her hand on the hot stove but doesn't feel any pain. She confides in Thom that the body on the beach was not her father, something she knows because she didn't recognize his hands. Thom suddenly becomes concerned about Toni.In town, Toni attends a screening of a movie called ""Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye"". She buys a ticket from an attendant who barely acknowledges her, and finds the rest of the lobby deserted. The minute she walks in, the attendant puts up a ""closed"" sign, and the lights on the marquee are turned out. Toni finds the large theater empty except for one or two other patrons. Having a seat in the center near the front, she watches the movie while the camera reveals more and more of the ghoulish townsfolk gathering in the seats behind her, until the theater is nearly full. Finally two of the ghouls take a seat on either side of Toni, and she notices they are bleeding from the eyes. Suddenly she turns around and realizes just how many of the strange people are in there with her and starts to panic, rushing for the exits, which are now blocked from the other side. Trapped inside with the ghouls, the movie ends and the screen goes white, and suddenly they rush at her and eat her while she screams.Thom, who has arrived in town too late to help Toni, sees some of the strange townspeople. Two police officers arrive and order a small crowd of them to disperse, after which the crowd advances on them. They start firing into them, but the people are unaffected by the bullets. Suddenly, one of the officers starts bleeding from the eyes, somehow infected by the same thing the townsfolk have. The normal officer fires on him and runs off, but the other shoots him in the back. The mob descends on him and they eat his body. Thom runs off and is chased by a few of the mob. One of them attacks him and claws at his neck, but he is able to break away. He encounters a normal woman, but she transforms as they speak, bleeding from her eyes.Meanwhile, Arletty discovers that the signs of her infection have worsened. She pokes a pin into her leg and cannot feel it, and she vomits a horde of insects and lizards into the sink. Finding someone else in the house with her, she realizes it is her father (Royal Dano), who tells her that the townspeople have been infected by a century-old curse brought on by a ""dark stranger"" who rode into town on a horse 100 years ago. A survivor of the Donner party, this stranger brought with him a strange curse of cannibalism, after which he walked into the sea, promising to return in 100 years when the moon turned blood red. He warns Arletty to leave, but she refuses to go without him, at which point he becomes violent and tries to attack her. Remembering the words of the vagrant, Arletty sets him on fire and frees him from the undead curse. Thom returns to the house and discovers the charred body, at which point a terrified Arletty attacks him and stabs his arm with scissors. Thom manages to calm her and they bandage his wound, but ghouls start breaking into the house and trying to surround them. They escape to the beach, where they find others waiting for the arrival of the ""dark stranger"". Trapped by the mass of ghouls, they swim out into the water, where Thom drowns due to his wounded arm.The film ends with Arletty back in the institution, where her voice-over narration informs us the ghouls pulled her from the water and dressed her in a gown as an offering to the dark stranger, who returned as predicted. She says he let her go in order to carry his story to others, which is why she was institutionalized. Unable to convince anyone that she's sane, Arletty is forced to wait in the asylum until the undead infection that began in Point Dune reaches the rest of the world, plunging it into chaos and bloodshed."

A nurse prepares a syringe and wheels her med cart down the hall of a hospital. As she passes a room with an open door, we see a doctor who has just given a shot to a young man. The nurse proceeds to Room 12 where she looks through a peephole and sees what looks like a patient covered up in bed. Unlocking the door, she enters with a med tray and sets it on a table. She closes the room door and walks to the open window, closing it and pulling the curtain. As she turns back, someone grabs the syringe and gives the injection to her. There is a great struggle as the nurse is forced back upon the bed, her dress lifted up. Next we see a shadowy figure exit the room. At the exit door a man is struck down, allowing the figure to leave the building. The doctor then notices the med cart and looks in the room where the nurse was going. He opens the door and goes in. Outside we see the path taken through woods from the escapee's point of view. [TITLE SHOWS] 
A couple watching television hear a noise in the house. The woman urges the man to investigate. They go into a bedroom which has been ransacked. The window is standing open as someone obviously has gone out. 
A man driving a car stops to make a phone call and hears someone starting his car. He runs out, shouting at the driver, who then runs him over. The car stops briefly as if checking to see the man is dead, and then drives off. 
A large tanker truck pulls into a truck stop and the truck driver Jim Nicholls (Ken Hutchison) goes into the Roadhouse Diner to eat. Shown in the parking lot is the blue Austin Maxi which was stolen from the man in the phone booth. 
Jim calls for bacon and eggs as he makes his way in. Standing nearby is Stephen Slade (Simon Ward) who is playing a slot machine and nursing a glass of whiskey. Jim orders ""the usual"" from the waitress at the bar and tells the barman he is late because someone escaped from Greenwood Sanitarium and the roads are blocked. 
Glancing in the mirror in front of him, Stephen notices a woman entering. Belle Adams (Hayley Mills) asks the barman how to get to Greenwood Station. He tells her the last bus has just left and there are no cabs. Thinking of Jim, he asks her to wait. Jim is talked into taking Belle with him since he is going that way and no lady should be out by herself with a maniac loose. 
Jim helps Belle into the cab of the truck and gets in on the driver's side. Starting the motor, Jim looks at her legs as they drive off. Stephen, having observed all this, gets in the blue car and takes a swig of whiskey. Suddenly a police car pulls into the parking lot with siren on. Two policemen enter the Roadhouse as Stephen drives off and begins following them. Showing a picture of the escapee (not to the camera), the cop is told the person was just here by the barman. 
Down the road, Jim asks Belle what time her train leaves and she replies two o'clock. He implies that it should be no problem. Seeing a roadblock ahead, he tells her to get down and covers her with a coat so the police will not see her. The officers stop him and ask where he's coming from. One cop looks under the truck and sees nothing, giving the all-clear sign to his partner. Driving on, Jim tells her to get up. He says he could lose his job if she were found riding along. She says she can't thank him enough. He replies, want to bet? Looking again at her legs, he asks if she is a model. She replies no, and says that she is grateful. He tells her that he hoped she would say that and pulls the truck over to the side of the road. When she asks what is wrong, he tells her that they need to settle the fare. He moves on her and a struggle ensues. Belle falls out of the truck and tries to run. He meets her from the other side and attempts to kiss her. She continues to resist him until finally he shoves her against a railing and leaves, throwing her purse out onto the road. The contents fall out and Belle goes to retrieve them. 
Stephen drives up at that moment and just misses hitting her. She begins picking up her things from the road as he stops and gets out. He accuses her of almost causing a wreck and she tells him that he is drunk. They are almost hit by another car as she tries to collect her things. He asks what she is doing and she tells him she is trying to get to Greenwood Station. When he offers her a lift, she sarcastically suggests not in his condition. He goes to leave, then stops and tells her to get in. They drive on in the rain. 
She refuses a drink from his whiskey bottle and tries to dry her hair. He says wasn't she at the Roadhouse? She tells him she caught a ride but the fare was too high. He says she was asking for it trying to ride with drivers. Her car will take a couple days to fix and she can take care of herself, she tells him. She continues to comb and dry her hair. 
He asks how long does it take to boil an ostrich egg. Four hours. She looks at him as if he is crazy. He tells her he has a book about how to make friends and it says to say something. She smiles and turns on the radio. An announcer says the escaped maniac is being sought. She turns the dial elsewhere and Stephen starts talking about the crazy people at Greenwood. 
She tells him that he missed the turn and should go back. He says there is no place to turn around. She insists that he back up. Reluctantly, he backs to the intersection and turns on the crossroad. 
After some more chatter, they pull into the train station and Stephen offers to check the train schedule. She waits in the car as he walks around the building. Seeing officers across the tracks, he is hesitant to draw attention to himself. Meanwhile Belle finds an envelope under the dash of the car addressed to a Mr. Hargreaves. Inside are pamphlets on farm equipment. She looks through them and replaces them in the envelope under the dash. 
He returns to the car and tells her that she missed the train and that there will not be one the next day. He suggests they stay at a hotel in a town where he is going. She guesses that she has no other choice. 
She tells him that she grew up in Whickham and he says he knows it well, remembering the beach. This triggers a flashback from her childhood where she rode a horse up and down the beach while her parents waited. As she distracted her father from the backseat of their car, there was a terrible crash where they were killed. She tells Stephen she feels sick and he offers to stop. She says she feels better now. 
Coming to a railroad crossing, the bars come down and they stop while a fast train goes through. He confesses that he shouldn't be stopped because of drinking today on his birthday. When she says she is unsure if he is telling the truth, he assures her that he is. When she sees the train, she asks where the next stop is, and can they get there. He begins driving fast and is chased by a police car, but loses it with another roadblock and some traffic. Finding a dirt road, they turn off and the cop goes on past. 
They park on the dirt road and she tells him she knows he lied about the train. He says he likes her and didn't want to lose her company. He says that she was talking about her uncle (Peter Jeffrey) that she went to live with in Whickham after her parents' death. In another flashback we see her riding a horse at her uncle's place. She tells Stephen she wants to visit Whickham to see where she grew up. He says he is a traveling salesman from Birmingham and that everyone has their problems. She asks about his, and he has a flashback showing when he and a girl went into a bedroom to make out at a party. 
Belle informs him that they are almost out of petrol, so they pull into a station. When no one comes out to wait on him, he blows the horn. He gets out and finds the office empty. Going around the side, he comes to the bathroom window and sees a girl (Nina Francis) changing clothes through a crack in the glass. Belle comes out and sees him looking in the window. When he sees her looking, he comes and confesses that he is unable to find anyone. At that moment the girl emerges from the bathroom and he asks for petrol. They walk to the pumps and Belle enters the bathroom. When she returns she notices Stephen and the girl being very chummy. He pays and Belle sits in the car. Stephen tells her he has to make a phone call and will be back soon. 
The girl is attacked from the point of view of the killer. When Stephen returns to the car, Belle is asleep. He apologizes for taking so long and they leave. The girl's bloodied body is shown on the floor, with papers strewn about. 
Belle asks Stephen what he sells and he makes her guess. When she suggests farm equipment, she pulls out the envelope and confesses that she peeped at it. He pretends and informs her that Mr. Hargreaves had the job before him. 
They stop to eat and Stephen gets two cups of coffee. As she is eating, two bikers enter (George Collis and Ralph Arliss) and ask her to save two chairs next to her. As a joke, one of them adds a cube of sugar to each of the coffees. Stephen removes the cubes and carries them to the table. He presents Belle with a new pack of cigarettes, then turns back for matches. He bumps into one of the bikers, spilling his drink. The biker gives him a dirty look. 
They drive off but are pursued by the bikers, who make it difficult to proceed. After some maneuvering Stephen rams the back tire of one of the bikes causing it to crash and burn. The other biker stops to see. Stephen drives on as Belle protests. He refuses to aid the biker and Belle tries to wrestle the steering wheel away from him. In the struggle she falls out of the car and he comes to a stop in a muddy field. He chases after her and they struggle more. When a passing car stops to ask if she needs help, Belle tells the two men everything is all right. They reluctantly leave. 
He asks Belle why she didn't give him up and says he will go back to check on the accident. She tells him it's too late now and the police will be after them. He takes a swig of whiskey and she knocks it away, saying his breath will get them in trouble. They get back in the car with Belle driving. 
As it gets dark outside, they see another roadblock ahead and Belle turns off on a side road. They park and she suggests they wait until morning. He says he should take her to a hotel in a nearby town. He doesn't want her involved if the biker is dead. She tells him he will need a witness. Puzzled, he asks why she changes her mind about him. You helped me, she tells him. He helps her lower the seat to sleep. 
As he watches her, he has a flashback where he is making love to his girlfriend (Juliet Aykroyd) unsuccessfully. She asks what is wrong and he says it is difficult to talk about. Belle and Stephen say goodnight and settle to sleep. 
When he wakes the next morning Belle is gone. He goes calling for her but is unable to find her. He finds the highway and sees a number of cars coming. He returns to his car and calls her name again. He notices his front headlight is busted. Getting back in the car, he takes off down the highway. 
Belle is seen shopping at a local store. Through the window she sees Stephen drive by but she is unable to stop him. He drives on, cursing her. 
Belle walks down a road with a bag of apples and spies a horse. She feeds the horse an apple, which triggers another flashback where she was feeding her uncle's horse. She overhears laughter and climbs up to the hayloft where she sees her uncle and a woman rolling in the hay. Upset, she spills the apples. Ironically, she also spills the apples in the present also, and begins picking them up from the roadway. 
A man, Malcolm Robarts (Sterling Hayden), drives up in a 1929 Cord and stops to help. He feigns an accent which she quickly detects is fake, but his enthusiasm impresses her to accept a ride with plans for dinner that evening. 
Stephen is seen at a gas station where a man is adding oil to his engine. Seeing the car pass with Belle and Robarts, he slams the hood and drives off with the attendant running after him. 
Stephen turns into a parking building, takes a ticket and parks on the top level. Belle and Robarts are seen at the Grand Pier, walking and talking. He tells her they should dine on his yacht where the chef is very good and looks through a telescope. When Belle takes a look, she sees only an old freighter. Nevertheless she is impressed with his efforts. 
Stephen walks to a shop where in the window he sees porno magazines, which causes a flashback where his girlfriend finds his porno mags and suggests that maybe whipping him will satisfy his needs. As he walks past the newspaper stand, the headline reads GREENWOOD ESCAPE-GIRL MURDERED AT FILLING STATION. 
At an abandoned carnival Robarts continues to try to woo Belle. She seems impressed. Meanwhile Stephen sees them at the edge of the pier. He runs over, calling to Belle. Recognizing that this is the young man Belle told him about, he helps her rejoin Stephen. 
Belle and Stephen bicker about the separation and she says she wants her coat from his car. They walk to the parking building. 
Meanwhile, Robarts buys a paper and sees the picture of the killer on it. He drives to the parking building and looks up. Stephen sees him and thinks he wants Belle. Robarts calls and points to him. She tells him that maybe the biker is dead and they are after him. Robarts drives into the parking building and Stephen and Belle drive down. They have to stop behind a couple of cars to pay their parking ticket but just manage to get away before Robarts can catch up. 
They get out on the road but soon see Robarts chasing after them. They manage to elude him on a crowded turn where Robarts runs off the road and crashes into a gate. Stephen believes they have lost him but Belle suggests they turn off the highway a different way. Meanwhile Robarts reaches a red phone booth and calls the police. 
She asks if Stephen is hungry and brings forward a square box which she offers as a birthday present to him. He seems touched and thanks her. She says he can open it later. They arrive at Whickham and are seen riding horses on the beach. Tying up the horses, they go into the Castle of Comfort and order two beers. As they are drinking, Stephen sees the young biker, who notices him. Setting down the beers, Stephen rushes Belle out, telling her they have to leave. When the biker goes outside, he doesn't see them or their car. He gets a glimpse of them riding away on horses just as the other biker comes out with his arm in a sling. Belle and Stephen return the horses to the stable where their car is parked and leave. 
Angry again, Stephen says he will take her back to her car. She tells him that it is too far and will not be ready until tomorrow. She suggests they stay in a hotel. He says he could use a bath and she agrees. This brings up another flashback where she was bathing and her uncle came in and saw her naked. He commented about having seen it all before and threw her a towel. 
Saying he needs to take some miles off the clock, Stephen speeds up just as they are passing a motorcycle cop (Roger Nott). The cop pursues them and they stop. Approaching the driver's window, the cop tells him to turn off the motor. He asks what happened to the car and cites a broken headlamp. Stephen tells him it was a bump and that he will have it fixed tomorrow. The officer asks for his license, but after stalling, he admits that he doesn't have it with him. Telling him to get it fixed tomorrow, the cop answers the question of a nearby hotel a few miles away. 
She agrees to stay at the hotel, taking any room they can. This triggers a daydream in which Belle strips down to black underwear and hose with garters. He imagines her calling his name and is returned by her doing so. She asks for a light and notices he is trembling. 
Going to the hotel desk, the clerk (Norman Tyrrell) says they are full. Asking for anything, he is told they have a fishing cabin available for ten pounds. Stephen signs the register as Mr. Jones. When he asks for the evening paper, the clerk reluctantly gives it to him. 
They drive a short distance to the cabin and Stephen gives the key to Belle, telling her he will park the car. She unlocks the door and goes inside. They both agree the place is nice. He asks if she will take a bath, to which she replies, after you.
He goes in to run water as she lights a cigarette and brings the paper into the bedroom. When he sees the paper, he comes out and says there is no hot water until morning. They agree to go on to bed in their clothes. He says he will take the couch and gets a blanket from a drawer. Goodnights are said and Stephen goes out and closes the door. 
Belle lies on the bed, triggering another flashback. This time her drunken uncle comes into her bedroom to put a necklace on her. He tries to force himself on her. Suddenly the door opens and Stephen comes in to return the bath towel to the bathroom. Saying goodnight again, he leaves and closes the door. She gets up and puts a chair in front of the door. 
Turning out the room lights, Stephen notices Belle walking around in the room as seen under the door. He goes to the keyhole and peeps through. She begins to undress but looks at the door. Sensing he might be looking, she covers the door with her coat. He notices a bullet hole in the wall. Getting a knife, he tries to make the opening larger. Looking through, he observes her undressing. She takes the paper and sees his picture next to a headline saying KILLER STRIKES AGAIN. She turns off the light so he can no longer see her. 
Stephen turns in on the couch and pulls the blanket over him. Meanwhile the cop arrives back at the station and sees the front of the paper. He exclaims and goes into action. 
Dressing again, Belle prepares to try to leave. Another flashback shows her uncle attacking her in bed again. She quickly returns to the present and tries to sneak out while Stephen is sleeping. She rummages through his coat pockets for the lighter. When she drops the coat, she goes back in the bedroom. Stephen gets up to get a cigarette but can't find his lighter. He knocks on her door. She gets into bed and pulls the covers up to appear to sleep. She kicks the paper off the bed onto the floor as he comes in. Finding the lighter in her room, he lights a cigarette. Picking up the paper on the floor, he goes out and closes her door. 
She gets up immediately and tries all the windows, which will not open. She sneaks out of the bedroom and picks up the paper from the floor. Not seeing Stephen, she opens the outside door and he is standing there. She closes and locks the door, which angers him. He begins calling her and beating on the door. 
Hearing the sound of broken glass, he goes around to the back and sees her running away through the woods. He follows, calling her. This triggers another flashback with her uncle still wrestling with her. She runs to the car and tries to start it. Stephen hears the car starting and runs to it. A police car pulls up to the hotel with siren on. Getting to the car, he looks inside and gets the paper from the dash. The full page is seen with her picture on the right, identifying her as the escaped killer. All at once she begins strangling him, mirroring how she strangled her uncle in a flashback. The paper shows his picture on the left, saying THIS MAN IS IN DANGER. 
The hotel clerk points the way for the police. As they arrive, Belle slowly exits the car trance-like. As they take her away, one cop looks in the blue car and finds Stephen dead. Belle imagines herself riding a horse on the beach as they prepare to take her in. She produces the square box meant for Stephen and opens it, telling them that it takes four hours to boil an ostrich egg. She takes out the egg and they drive off."

They return to New York City, where Paul works as an architect.Joanna and their daughter Carol Anne (Kathleen Tolan) shop for groceries at D'Agostino's. Three hooligans (one played by Jeff Goldblum) are wreaking havoc in the supermarket. They catch Joanna's address after she asks that her groceries be delivered. They follow her to the apartment, burst in and trash the apartment. They search for money but find only $7. The hooligans then rape Carol and savagely beat Joanna, escaping scot-free.Paul's son-in-law Jack Toby (Steven Keats) calls to tell him only that Joanna and Carol are in the hospital. After waiting impatiently, Paul is told by a doctor that his daughter is okay and that she was sedated and put to bed, but his wife has died. Devastated, he is told by police that the likelihood of catching the criminals is small since his wife is dead and his daughter, the only witness, traumatized from her ordeal of being raped, cannot speak. That night, a frustrated Paul goes out for a walk and quickly encounters a mugger who attempts to rob him with a gun. Carrying a sock full of quarters, Paul swings it at the would-be-mugger and flees, narrowly escaping from being shot.The next day, Paul's boss gives him an extended business vacation to Tucson, Arizona to meet a client, Ames Jainchill (Stuart Margolin), who shows him the ropes. Paul witnesses a mock gunfight at Old Tucson, a reconstructed Western frontier town used as a movie set. At a gun club, Ames is impressed when Paul shoots near bulls-eye accuracy. He reveals that he was a ""CO"" (conscientious objector) during the Korean War who served his country as a combat medic. Ames drops him at the airport, slipping a little going-away present into Paul's bag.Back in New York, Paul visits Jack who tells him that his daughter is catatonic and will likely never recover. At home, Paul opens his suitcase and the gift box that Ames left him to find a nickel-plated .32 Colt Police Positive revolver. He pockets the gun and takes a stroll that night. While walking alone in Riverside Park, Paul almost immediately encounters a mugger, a doped-up ex-convict named Thomas Leroy Marston who attempts to rob him at gunpoint with a .38 Smith & Wesson Model 36 revolver. Paul shoots him with his own revolver, killing him.Shocked that he just killed a human being, Paul runs home and throws up. But his vigilantism continues the following night, when he guns down three black men (one with an afro is played by an uncredited Denzel Washington) who are robbing a defenseless old man in a vacant alley.A few nights later, two muggers see Paul on a subway, holding a bag of groceries. They attempt to rob him at knife-point but Paul shoots them both with the revolver. Paul again gets away.Another night later, Paul is sitting in a sleazy 8th Avenue coffee shop surrounded by prostitutes and assorted street people. He pays his bill to the cashier purposely revealing a wallet full of cash. He leaves followed by two black thugs, named George and Joseph, who have taken the bait. Yet again a robbery attempt is made in a subway tunnel. Paul shoots one but the other manages to stab him in his shoulder before he gets shot as well. As a wounded Paul stumbles off, the one who stabbed him gets away mortally wounded, dying at a hospital.Police Lt. Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) investigates the vigilante killings. His department narrows a list to men who have had a family member recently killed by muggers and who are war veterans. The public, meanwhile, is happy that somebody is doing something about crime.Lt. Ochoa soon suspects Paul. He is about to make an arrest when the District Attorney (Fred J. Scollay) intervenes and tells Ochoa to ""let him loose"" in another city instead. Ochoa doesn't like the idea, but relents.In the meantime, Paul has his daughter committed to a mental hospital in upstate New Hampshire where she will remain catatonic, possibly for life. After returning to New York, Paul hides his .32 gun in a hidden drawer in his office while adjusting (and possibly enjoying) committing murder against muggers to ""clean up the city"". When Paul invites Jack over for dinner, Jack cannot understand Paul's sudden and happy mood.(Note: The three muggers who murdered Paul's wife and assaulted his daughter are never seen again in the movie, so their fate is left ambiguous.)One evening, Lt. Ochoa anonymously phones Paul at his office to tip him off that the police are watching him, hoping to provoke a reaction or slip up from Paul. When Paul is briefly detained by the police after leaving his office, they do not find any gun on him and allow him to continue on his way.Aware that the police are starting to catch on to him, Paul gives them the slip by sneaking out of his apartment building through a backdoor service entrance. He goes to his office to retrieve his gun and then goes out looking for more would-be muggers where he is confronted by three street gang members in Central Park who try to mug him. Paul shoots two of them before he is wounded in his right leg by a third mugger who is armed with a .45 caliber M1911A1 pistol. Despite his wound, Paul chases the third mugger through the park, the streets, and to an industrial warehouse area where the third mugger gets away as Paul attempts to take aim at him, only to fall to the ground.Hospitalized, Paul is confronted by Ochoa after a sympathetic policeman finds Paul's revolver near the latest crime scene and gives it to the detective. Ochoa makes Paul promise to leave New York, permanently in exchange to avoid prosecution for the vigilante killings. Paul replies, ""By sundown?""In the final scene, set one week later. Paul arrives in Chicago Union Station by train. Being greeted by a company representative, he notices a group of hoodlums harassing a woman. He excuses himself and helps the woman. The hoodlums make obscene gestures, but Kersey points his right hand like a gun and smiles... suggesting that his vigilantism will resume sooner or later."

A firing squad executes a small group of Spanish rebels who cry out Down with liberty! or Long live chains! The troops are encamped in a Catholic church which they desecrate by drinking, singing, and eating the communion wafers. The captain caresses a statue of a medieval woman and is knocked unconscious by her husband (a knights funerary statue). In revenge, the captain exhumes the body of the wife to find her face has not decomposed; there is a suggestion of intended necrophilia.Cut to the present day where a nanny is reading the voice-over from a book whilst seated on a park bench. The children in her care are given some pictures by a strange man in the park; there are implications of child abduction or pedophilia. Cut to a close-up of a spider and the interior of a bourgeois apartment where a man is fed up with symmetry as he rearranges his mantelpiece. The children arrive home and show the pictures to their parents who are shocked that the girls have such images. The parents are disgusted and yet erotically stimulated by the images which we assume to be pornographic when we see the images, they are revealed as picture postcards of architecture (there is a satirical nod towards Freudian symbolism in the images of tunnels and columns). The parents then let the children keep the pictures and dismiss the nanny. At bedtime, the husband cant sleep as he is woken in the night by a cockerel, a postman and an emu wandering through his bedroom.In the next scene, the husband visits his doctor, who dismisses these nighttime experiences as apparitions despite the fact that the husband has physical evidence in the form of a letter from the nocturnal postman. The evidence is never considered as the doctors nurse interrupts the conversation to tell her employer that she must visit her sick father. The nurse drives through a rainy night, meeting a military tank on the road that is apparently hunting foxes. The soldiers tell her that the road ahead is blocked; the nurse drives to an isolated hotel.A storm breaks as the nurse checks in at the small rural hotel. Some Carmelite monks are also staying at the hotel. She takes supper in her room while a flamenco dancer and guitarist perform in an adjacent room. The monks interrupt her as she is dressing for bed. They offer to use a holy effigy and prayer to assist her sick father, they begin to pray. Time has passed and the monks are playing a game of poker with the nurse and the hotel manager, gambling with holy relics, smoking and drinking alcohol.That same night, some new guests arrive at the hotel; a young man and his aunt. The young nephew has brought his aunt to the hotel for an incestuous affair yet another sexual taboo is addressed. They retire to their room, the elderly aunt confesses that she is a virgin, when the nephew pulls back the sheets to look at her naked body; she has the body of a young woman. The nephew is refused by his aunt and leaves his room to join another couple (a hatter and his female assistant) for a drink. The nurse and the four monks are also invited into the hatters room. While the guests are socialising, the hatters assistant dons a dominatrix outfit with a whip. The hatter, who is wearing bottomless trousers, proceeds to be masochistically flagellated by his assistant in front of the other guests who are shocked and leave. The nephew returns to his aunt, who is now willing to make love with him.The next morning, the nurse leaves for the town of Argenton, giving a lift to another resident who is breakfasting in the bar. This resident is a professor at the police academy. He is dropped off at work where he gives a lecture to a class of delinquent policemen on the subject of the relativism of laws, customs and taboos. The lecture is constantly interrupted until only two officers are left in the class. The professor continues, using a dinner party at his friends house to illustrate a point he is making. We then cut to the dinner party which is being held in a modern bourgeois apartment.The guests are seated around the table on flushing toilets.

He is arrested, found guilty and sentenced to death but leaves the courtroom to be treated as a celebrity.Mr. Legendre is called to see the Prefect of Police who returns the missing daughter. The prefect is about to read a letter explaining how the girl was found but is interrupted and leaves to visit a bar. In the bar he meets a woman who looks like his dead sister (we see a flashback in which he remembers his sister playing the piano, naked). He then receives a phone call from his dead sister, asking him to meet her at the mausoleum.

At her home, Foxy gets out of bed and changes clothes, hiding a gun inside her brassiere. Meanwhile, Link tries to engage the policemen in conversation, but they drive away, leaving him alone with Eddie and Bunyon. As the thugs close in on Link, Foxy hits them with her car, and Link jumps on the vehicle, sliding inside through the sunroof.Returning home with Link, Foxy demands an explanation. Link confesses to owing a loan shark $20,000 that he lost betting on numbers but argues that his petty crimes do not compare to her missing boyfriend's dishonorable work as a police informer.

They watch as Oscar and a cohort corner a drug dealer, beat him, and shove him into the back of a car. Foxy introduces Michael to her friend, and Oscar explains that he's part of a ""neighborhood committee"" working to expel drug dealers from the area.

Foxy and Michael make love before he returns to the hospital where he must stay one more night.The next morning, Foxy finds Link reading an old newspaper article announcing Dalton's disappearance three months ago. Link guesses that someone made a lot of money exposing Dalton as an informer. Foxy leaves, and Link studies Dalton's picture in the article, tracing lines over his face. Detecting something in the picture, he makes a phone call.At the office of Tedesco (Jack Bernardi), a drug supplier, Leroy, a chemist (Robert Nadder), tests Tedesco's latest batch of heroin and assures Elias that the product is 80% pure. Arranging a deal with Tedesco, Elias agrees to fly the product in from Mexico on a small plane. Later, Miss Wall discusses a new rumor that Dalton is still alive with Elias and his thugs. Bunyon claims he killed Dalton months ago, but Elias doesn't believe him. Wall instructs the men to make sure Dalton is dead.Foxy returns home and finds the newspaper article Link was looking at, noticing that he traced over Dalton's facial features. Foxy worries her brother may have detected Michael's disguise. Moments later, Michael is shot outside her home. Seeking revenge, Foxy finds her brother at his apartment and shoots at him, demanding to know whom he told about Michael. Link claims ignorance, and she fires another shot that grazes his ear. Relenting, he tells Foxy about Katherine Wall, who runs a high-end female escort service and also controls the local drug syndicate.Foxy visits the Katherine Wall Modeling Agency to apply for work, using the name ""Misty Cotton."" Foxy tells Miss Wall she knows what goes on at the agency and is willing to sell her body for the right price. The following day, Foxy reports to Wall's house where several women are being groomed. Foxy is assigned to accompany an escort named Claudia (Juanita Brown) to a party. There, they must befriend Judge Fenton (Harry Holcombe), who will decide a case the next day involving two of Elias's drug dealers. Claudia says their goal is to make sure Fenton finds the dealers innocent; otherwise, Wall might send them to a place in Haiti where men do unspeakable things to prostitutes. Outside Wall's house, Claudia's estranged husband, Willard (Edward Cross), approaches with their young son, Jason, and announces they are moving to Seattle, Washington, where he has a job. Claudia begs him not to take her son away, and Willard suggests that she come to Seattle. Eddie, Elias and Wall overhear as Claudia tells Willard she feels trapped by her employers. Eddie and Elias beat Willard, sending him and Jason away.As they ride to the party, Foxy watches Claudia ingest pills. At a hotel suite, Claudia and Foxy find Fenton surrounded by colleagues and topless escorts. The women take Fenton to a bedroom, remove his pants, and shove him into the hallway to be ridiculed by passersby. Afterward, Claudia comments on the danger she and Foxy now face after botching the assignment, Foxy promises to take Claudia somewhere safe.The next day, Elias informs Wall that Fenton convicted their drug dealers, and assures her that his men are searching for Foxy and Claudia. Meanwhile, Claudia sneaks out of Foxy's house in search of a drink. At a lesbian bar, Claudia (a closeted lesbian herself) talks to a woman named Bobbie (Jeanine Epper). Foxy finds Claudia at the bar and says they must leave, but Bobbie objects, challenging her to a fight. Foxy knocks Bobbie down with a stool, inciting a bar brawl. Outside, Claudia and Foxy spot Eddie, Bunyon and Elias. The men give chase and, while Claudia jumps over a fence and escapes, Foxy fights them. The men trap Foxy and, later, Wall watches as they torture her. Elias tells Wall Foxy's real name and identifies her as Dalton Ford's former girlfriend. Wall orders them to give Foxy a shot of heroin and send her to ""the ranch.""Sometime later, Foxy wakes up in a rundown house and finds one of her captors, Slauson (Boyd Red Morgan), sleeping. She hears Brandt (H.B. Haggerty), another captor, singing outside. Foxy sneaks out of the house, but Slauson, who was only pretending to sleep, lassos her with a rope, drags her back inside, and ties her to the bed. Brandt administers more heroin to subdue Foxy and rapes her.After Brandt has left the room, Foxy uses her mouth to grab a straight razor from the bedside table. Cutting the ropes, Foxy frees herself and grabs several wire hangers from a closet, twisting them into a makeshift weapon. In the kitchen, she leans through an open window, grabs one end of a siphon connected to a barrel, and siphons gasoline into a pot on the stove. When Slauson approaches, she strikes his face multiple times with the hangers and he falls to the floor. Brandt rushes inside, and Foxy douses him with the gasoline, setting him and the house on fire.After hearing about the fire and suspecting Foxy of starting it and killing two of her men, Miss Wall orders Elias to find and kill her. Soon after, Eddie and Elias burst into Link's apartment and demand Foxy's whereabouts. Link claims he doesn't know, and Elias shoots him dead and they kill his girlfriend Deb by slashing her neck.At the offices of Oscar's neighborhood committee, Foxy learns of Link's murder. Oscar leads her into a room where the committee responds to Foxy's request for help. Though they are hesitant to become involved in Foxy's revenge against Wall, she begs the men to aid her for the sake of her dead brother. The committee wants to know if Foxy has a plan, and she asks if anyone knows the name of the pilot who works for Elias.At a bar by the airport, Foxy flirts with Elias's pilot, Hays (Sig Haig), telling him that she's never been on a plane but wants to go. Obliging her, Hays takes Foxy on his next flight. Soon after, he lands his small plane near a hideout where Elias, Eddie, and Leroy await. Near the hideout, Oscar and his men approach two police officers guarding the area. As Hays greets Elias and his cohorts with the drugs, Foxy starts the plane back up and drives it toward Bunyon, running him over and killing him. She crashes the plane into a shed, and Elias's men shoot at her, but the neighborhood committee members arrive, armed with guns, and shoot back. After they trap Elias, Foxy looks on as one of the members begins to torture him with a knife.That night, Foxy carries a bag into Miss Wall's home, but Eddie and another henchman stop her and take the bag. Inside, he finds a jar containing Elias's genitals. Foxy removes a small hand gun from her afro, shoots and kills the two henchman, then shoots Wall in the shoulder when she lunges at Foxy with a knife. Instead of killing her, Foxy says she wants Miss Wall to live and suffer, along with Elias.

tt0071524,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']","Chicago, Illinois, 1929.Outside a criminal courts building, police build a scaffold and bleachers for the public hanging of Earl Williams, who has been convicted of killing a policeman. Upstairs, reporters play poker in the press room. Newspaper editor Walter Burns (Walter Matthau) calls from the Chicago Examiner, looking for reporter Hildebrand 'Hildy' Johnson (Jack Lemmon) to put him on the story, but he's not there. Walter leaves word that Hildy should immediately come to his office.Later, Hildy wanders into Walter's office at a leisurely pace and informs the editor that he's in love. Walter tells Hildy he wants him to cover the hanging the next morning and snap an illegal picture of the hanged man with a hidden camera. Minutes after the execution, an ambulance will be waiting for Hildy outside so that he can type his story in the back and beat the other newspapers to press with a morning extra. Hildy tells Walter he's quitting to get married and move to Philadelphia. He plans to take an advertising job so that he can spend time with his future wife instead of continuing as a workaholic reporter. Walter resents Hildy for betraying him, insisting that he taught Hildy everything he knows.Determined to keep Hildy in town and on the Williams story, Walter tracks down Hildy's fiancee, Peggy Grant (Susan Sarandon), an organist who works at a movie theater. Posing as Otto Fishbein, a probation officer, he tells Peggy that Hildy is on probation and cannot legally move to another city. Hildy then calls his fiancee, and, over the phone, realizes that Walter is playing a trick. Hildy explains to Peggy that Fishbein is actually Walter, and she sends him away.At the criminal courts press room, Hildy's replacement, Rudy Keppler (Jon Korkes), arrives and informs the others that Hildy has left the business. Mollie Malloy (Carol Burnett) arrives moments later, and yells at the reporters for writing lies about her, claiming she is Williams' girlfriend. Mollie confesses that she had befriended Williams but was not his girlfriend. Unlike the reporters, Mollie believes that Williams didn't intentionally kill anyone. As Mollie leaves, Hildy shows up with drinks to celebrate his new advertising job. Just then, the sheriff (Vincent Gardenia) visits the press room to hand out tickets to the hanging. Hildy accuses the sheriff and mayor of reprieving Williams twice so that the hanging would take place just before an election. The sheriff insists that Williams is a communist who is very sane and shot the policeman to make a political statement. Hildy disagrees, claiming that Williams is ""just a screwball.""At the jailhouse, Williams (Austin Pendleton), a diminutive, soft-spoken man, is escorted to the sheriff's office for his final psychological examination. Williams calmly explains to Dr. Eggelhofer (Martin Gabel) that he once sent a bomb to J. P. Morgan's office on Wall Street, then contradicts himself by saying he loves people and would never abuse anyone. Eggelhofer borrows the sheriff's gun to demonstrate his theory about why Williams shot at the police officer.Upstairs, Hildy's celebration is interrupted by gunshots. Sirens blare, more shots are heard, and the reporters realize Williams has escaped. Hildy gets on the phone to tell Walter the news. The editor laments that Hildy is no longer reporting, but Hildy promises he's ""right on top of it.""Downstairs, the sheriff tells reporters about Williams' escape, but insists he doesn't know where the prisoner got a gun. Hildy runs into Jennie (Doro Merande), the building's janitor, who overheard the incident. She tells Hildy she had better not reveal what she overheard, as the sheriff would fire her. Meanwhile, the injured Eggelhofer's stretcher falls out of an ambulance. As the stretcher speeds down the street, Eggelhofer yells repeatedly that Williams is a ""fruitcake.""Hildy phones Walter to tell him what he's learned from Jennie, that Eggelhofer used the sheriff's gun to reenact the crime, and Williams stole it, shot Eggelhofer, and made his escape. Hildy then informs Walter that Peggy is picking him up in 15 minutes and he can no longer follow the story.The Mayor (Harold Gould) addresses reporters in his office and tells them he has utter faith in the sheriff. After the reporters leave, the Mayor reprimands the sheriff for letting Williams get away. A man named Plunkett (Paul Benedict) arrives and delivers a reprieve for Williams, sent by the Governor. The sheriff receives a phone call that police have trapped Williams. The Mayor tells Plunkett that the reprieve is not applicable because Williams has escaped custody, but he may try to serve the reprieve again tomorrow. The Mayor then sends orders, via the sheriff, for the police to ""shoot to kill,"" now that Williams is in their sights.Headed for a night train to Philadelphia, Hildy joins Peggy in a taxi outside the courthouse. However, when he realizes he left the wedding rings, he runs back inside. There, Hildy finds the rings moments before Williams falls through a window and points a gun at him. Hildy reminds Williams that he conducted an interview with the convict at his jail cell a few days ago. Williams then passes out, and Hildy drags him to the bathroom, draws the curtains, and calls Walter to tell him that he has Williams in his custody. Mollie shows up, and Williams emerges at the sound of her voice. Hildy sends Peggy to pick up their luggage while he finishes up some last-minute business.Hildy hides Williams inside a roll-top desk when the other reporters demand entry to the press room. The men suspect Hildy is hiding something. To cover for Hildy, Mollie claims to know where Williams is, then jumps out the window. The reporters run outside to see if she's still alive. As the room clears, Walter appears at the door. He orders a delivery truck and six large men to move the desk, with Williams inside, to the Chicago Examiner office. Hildy types up a story while Walter takes Williams' picture and sends Keppler to develop the negative.Just then, Peggy returns to find Hildy typing away with Walter at his side. Distracted, Hildy suggests Peggy go to the train station ahead of him, and she leaves, dejected. When he finishes the story, Hildy becomes frustrated with Walter's persistence and heads off to the train station. Before he can leave, however, the sheriff shows up with the other reporters, all of whom accuse Hildy of hiding something. A policeman holds Hildy, while the sheriff demands Williams' whereabouts. The sheriff finally realizes Williams is inside the desk. Police escort Williams away, and the sheriff arrests Hildy and Walter for hiding the convict.In a jail cell, Hildy blames Walter for keeping him from Peggy. In a neighboring cell, Plunkett, who has been arrested for drunkenness, overhears Walter and informs him that he has Williams' reprieve. The Mayor arrives at the jail, and Walter presents him with the reprieve, accusing him of ignoring it so that he could hang Williams before the election. The Mayor lets Walter and Hildy out, and Walter arranges for Hildy to be rushed to the train station to meet Peggy. Just before the train pulls away, Walter gives Hildy his pocket watch as a gift for service to his newspaper. After the train pulls out of the station, Walter (crafty and evil to the end) arranges for Hildy to be arrested at the next stop for stealing his watch!The film closes with a series of texts that say that some time later, Hildy returned to the Chicago Examiner to become Managing Editor. Walter retired, lecturing from time to time at the University of Chicago on the ethics of journalism. Williams, now freed, got married to Mollie, and the two run a health-food store together."
tt0071562,"['Crime', 'Drama']","The Godfather Part II presents two parallel storylines. One involves Mafia chief Michael Corleone in 1958/1959 after the events of the first movie; the other is a series of flashbacks following his father, Vito Corleone from 1917 to 1925, from his youth in Sicily (1901) to the founding of the Corleone family in New York.The film begins in 1901, in the town of Corleone, Sicily, at the funeral of young Vito's father, Antonio Andolini, who has been murdered for an insult to the local Mafia lord, Don Ciccio. During the procession, Vito's older brother is murdered because he swore revenge on the Don. Vito's mother goes to Ciccio to beg for mercy, but he refuses, knowing that nine-year-old Vito will seek revenge later in life. The mother takes Ciccio hostage at knifepoint, allowing her son to escape, and Ciccio's men kill her. They search the town for the boy, but he is aided in his escape by the townspeople. Vito finds his way by ship to New York, and at Ellis Island an immigration agent chooses Vito's hometown of Corleone as his surname, and he is registered as ""Vito Corleone"".In 1958 in a scene similar to the opening of the first film, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), Godfather of the Corleone family, deals with various business and family problems during an elaborate party at his Lake Tahoe, Nevada compound to celebrate his son's First Communion. In his office, Michael meets with corrupt Nevada Senator Pat Geary (G. D. Spradlin) to discuss the price of the gaming licenses for the hotel/casinos the Family is buying. Geary, who has obvious contempt for Michael and other Italian businessmen who are moving into his state to take advantage of gambling opportunities, promises to make Michael's acquisition of his gaming license a difficult process. Michael ends his conversation with Geary when he refuses to pay the outrageous fee Geary demands, telling the senator he'll get nothing.Michael also deals with his self-indulgent younger sister Connie (Talia Shire), who, although recently divorced from her second husband, is planning to marry a man named Merl Johnson (Troy Donahue) with no obvious means of support and of whom Michael disapproves. He also talks with Johnny Ola (Dominic Chianese), the right hand man of Jewish gangster Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), who is supporting Michael's move into the gambling industry. Belatedly, Michael deals with Frank ""Five Angels"" Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo), a business associate who took over Corleone caporegime Peter Clemenza's territory in New York City after his death, and now has problems with the Rosato Brothers, who are backed by Roth. Pentangeli leaves abruptly, after telling Michael ""your father did business with Hyman Roth, your father respected Hyman Roth, but your father never trusted Hyman Roth.""Later that night, Michael barely escapes an assassination attempt when his wife Kay (Diane Keaton) notices the bedroom window drapes are inexplicably open, which allows two unseen hitmen to spray the bedroom with bullets. The two hitman are found dead having been killed by a ""mole"" within the compound. Afterwards, Michael tells his lawyer and associate Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) that the hit was made with the help of someone close, and that he must leave, entrusting all his power to Hagen to protect his family.Flashback: In 1917 New York City, the adult Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) works in a grocery store in the Lower East side with his friend Genco Abbandando. The neighborhood is controlled by a member of the ""The Black Hand,"" Don Fanucci (Gastone Moschin), who extorts protection payments from local businesses. One night, Vito's neighbor Clemenza (Bruno Kirby) asks him to hide a stash of guns for him, and later, to repay the favor, takes him to a fancy apartment where they commit their first felony together, stealing an elegant rug.The film flash-forwards to Michael's time. Michael meets with poushal Hyman Roth in Miami, Florida who tells Michael that he believes Frank Pentangeli was responsible for the assassination attempt, and that Pentangeli will pay for it. Traveling to Brooklyn, Michael lets Pentangeli know that Roth was actually behind it, and that Michael has a plan to deal with Roth, but he needs Frankie to cooperate with the Rosato Brothers in order to put Roth off guard.While sleeping, Fredo gets a phone call in the middle of the night from Johnny Ola, Hyman Roth's right hand man, revealing that Fredo is the traitor in the family. Johnny Ola conspires with Fredo, telling him that Frank Pentangeli is going to make peace with the Rosato Brothers. Johnny Ola asks Fredo information about the meeting between these two parties, and whether or not Pentangeli will be alone. Fredo disagrees to cooperate and tells Johnny Ola to never call him again.When Pentangeli goes to meet with the Rosatos at a local bar, he is told ""Michael Corleone says hello,"" as he is attacked from behind but the attempted murder is accidentally interrupted by a policeman. Pentangeli is left for dead, and his bodyguard, Willi Cicci (Joe Spinell), is struck by a car while shooting at the Rosatos as they drive away.Back in Nevada, Tom Hagen is called to a brothel in Carson City run by Michael's older brother Fredo (John Cazale), where Senator Geary is implicated in the death of a prostitute, and Tom offers to take care of the problem in return for ""friendship"" between the Senator and the Corleone family.Meanwhile, Michael meets Roth in Havana, Cuba, in late 1958, at the time when dictator Fulgencio Batista is soliciting American investment, and communist guerrillas are trying to bring down the government. At a birthday party for Roth, Michael mentions that there is a possibility that the rebels might win, making their business dealings in Cuba problematic. Earlier that day, Michael had witnessed a communist rebel kill a Havana policemen by detonating a grenade that also killed the rebel himself. The comment prompts Roth to remark, privately, that Michael has not delivered the two million dollars to firm their partnership.Fredo, carrying the promised money, arrives in Havana and meets Michael. Michael mentions Hyman Roth and Johnny Ola to him, but Fredo says he has never met them. Michael confides to his brother that it was Roth who tried to kill him, and that he plans to try again. Michael assures Fredo that he has already made his move, and that ""Hyman Roth will never see the New Year.""Instead of turning over the money to Roth, Michael asks him who gave the order to have Frank Pentangeli killed. Roth avoids the question, instead speaking angrily of the murder of his old friend, Moe Greene, which Michael had orchestrated (as depicted at the end of the first film).Michael has asked Fredo, who knows Havana well, to show Senator Geary and other important officials and businessmen a good time, during which Fredo pretends to not recognize Johnny Ola. Soon after, at a sex show, Fredo comments loudly that Johnny Ola told him about the place, contradicting what he told Michael twice earlier, that he didn't know Roth or Ola. Michael now realizes that the traitor is his own brother, and dispatches his bodyguard to deal with Roth.Johnny Ola is strangled, but Roth, in a delicate state because of his heart condition, is taken to a hospital, where Michael's enforcer is shot trying to kill him. At Batista's New Year's Eve party, at the stroke of midnight, Michael grasps Fredo tightly by the head and kisses him: ""I know it was you Fredo; you broke my heart."" When guerrillas attack, the guests flee, but Fredo refuses to go with Michael, despite Michael's pleas that Fredo is still his brother and that it's the only way out.Flashback (1917): Don Fanucci of the Black Hand is now aware of the partnership between Vito, Clemenza and Sal Tessio (John Aprea), and wants his share of their profits every week. Clemenza and Tessio agree to pay, but Vito is reluctant and asks his friends to leave everything in his hands so Fanucci will accept less and indeed, Vito manages to get Fanucci to take only one sixth of what he demanded ($100 out of $600). Immediately afterward, during the neighborhood festa, Vito murders Fanucci in the hallway outside his apartment and then rejoins his wife and three children on the stoops outside his tenement. Vito tells the infant Michael that his father loves him very much.In January 1959, Nevada, Michael returns to his snow-covered Lake Tahoe compound after fleeing Cuba, where Tom Hagen tells him that Roth escaped from Cuba after suffering a stroke and is recovering in Miami, that Michael's bodyguard is dead, and that Fredo is probably hiding in New York. Hagen also informs Michael that Kay had a miscarriage while he was away. Michael is distraught at the news and furiously demands to know the sex of the child, but Tom is unable to tell him.Flashback (1920): with Fanucci dead and with no one else to take over the Black Hand, Vito earns the respect of the neighborhood and begins to intercede in local disputes, operating out of the storefront of his Genco Pura Olive Oil Company (named after his friend Genco Abbandando) which he manages as well as give out ""favors"" to others in the community such as a local young woman threatened with eviction. Vito intimidates her landlord into letting her stay for a few extra weeks... rent free.In Washington, D.C. of 1959, a Senate committee, of which Senator Geary is a member, is conducting an investigation into the Corleone family. They question disaffected ""soldier"" Willi Cicci about his role as a button man in the Family, but he cannot implicate Michael, because he never received any direct orders from him. When Michael appears before the committee, Senator Geary makes a big show of supporting Italian-Americans and then excuses himself from the proceedings. During questioning, Michael denies all criminal allegations against him, from the murder of Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey back in 1946 (in the first Godfather movie), and to his business status of operating several gambling casinos in Nevada. Michael makes a statement challenging the committee to produce a witness to corroborate the charges against him. The hearing ends with the Chairman promising a witness who will do exactly that.Frank Pentangeli, who survived the attack by the Rosato Brothers, has made a deal with the FBI, and will testify against Michael. Tom Hagen and Michael discuss the problem, observing that Roth's strategy to destroy Michael is well planned. Michael's brother Fredo has been found and persuaded to return to Nevada, and in a private meeting he explains to Michael his betrayal: upset about being passed over to head the family in favor of Michael, he wants respect and his due. He helped Roth thinking there would be something in it for him, but he swears he didn't know they wanted to kill Michael. He also tells Michael that the Senate Committee's chief counsel is Roth's man. Michael then tells Fredo: ""You're nothing to me now. Not a brother, not a friend, nothing"", and privately instructs soldier and button man Al Neri (Richard Bright) that nothing is to happen to Fredo while their mother is still alive.At the hearing in which Frank Pentangeli is to testify, Michael arrives accompanied by Pentangeli's brother, brought from Sicily, and whose presence causes Frank to recant his previous statements about Michael. When Pentangeli is pressed, he claims that he just told the FBI what they wanted to hear. With no witness to testify against Michael, the committee adjourns, with Hagen, acting as Michael's lawyer, loudly demanding an apology.At a hotel room afterwards, Kay tries to leave Michael, taking their children with her. Michael at first tries to mollify her, but loses his temper and hits her violently when she reveals to him that her recent ""miscarriage"" was actually an abortion to avoid providing another child into Michael's criminal inheritance. She also tells him that the baby was a boy, further infuriating Michael.Flashback (1925): While visiting Sicily for a family vacation for the first time in over 20 years, Vito Corleone is introduced to the elderly 90-year-old Don Ciccio as the man who imports their olive oil to America, and who wants his blessing. When Ciccio asks Vito who his father was, Vito says, ""My father's name is Antonio Andolini, and this is for you!"", cutting the old man's stomach open with a knife, avenging the death of his father, mother, and brother. As they make their escape from Ciccio's compound and his men, Don Tomasello is shot in the leg by one of Ciccio's bodyguards, giving him a permanent limp.In April 1959, Carmella Corleone (Morgana King), Vito's widow and the mother of his children, dies, and the whole Corleone family is reunited for her funeral. Michael still shuns Fredo, who is miserable, but relents when Connie implores him to. Michael and Fredo embrace, but at the same time Michael signals to his capo that Fredo's protection from harm, in effect while their mother lived, has now run out.Michael, Tom Hagen, and Rocco Lampone discuss their final dealings with Hyman Roth, who has been unsuccessfully seeking asylum from various countries, and was even refused entry to Israel as a returned Jew. Michael rejects Hagen's advice that the Corleone family's position is secure, and killing Roth and the Rosato brothers for revenge is an unnecessary risk. Later, Hagen pays a visit to the imprisoned Frank Pentangeli on a military base and suggests that he take his own life, in the manner of unsuccessful ancient Roman conspirators who, in return, were promised that their families would be taken care of after their suicide.With the connivance of Connie, Kay visits her children, but cannot bear to leave them and stays too long. When Michael arrives, he coldly closes the door in her face.The movie reaches its climax in a montage of assassinations and death, reminiscent of the end of Part One:As he arrives at an airport to be taken into custody, Hyman Roth is killed by Rocco Lampone, disguised as a journalist, who himself is immediately shot dead by Roth's bodyguards.On the military base, Frank Pentangeli is found dead, having followed Hagen's instructions and committed suicide in his bathtub.Fredo is murdered by Al Neri while they are fishing on Lake Tahoe - while Fredo is saying a Hail Mary to help catch a fish.The penultimate scene takes place in 1941, and the Corleone family is preparing a surprise birthday party for their father Vito. Sonny (James Caan) introduces Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), Connie's future husband and betrayer of Sonny, to his family. They all talk about the recent attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese, and Michael shocks everybody by announcing that he has just enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. Sonny ridicules Michael's choice, and Tom Hagen mentions how his father has great expectations for Michael. Fredo is the only one who supports his brother's decision. Sal Tessio comes in with the cake for the party, and when Vito arrives, all but Michael leave the room to greet him.The final shot in the film is Michael sitting by himself at Lake Tahoe, in silent contemplation."

That night, Sinbad has a strange dream in which he sees a man dressed in black, repeatedly calling Sinbad's name, and also about a mysterious girl with an eye tattooed on her right palm. During his sleep, a mysterious storm throws his ship off course, and the next day Sinbad and his men find themselves near a coastal town in the country of Marabia.Swimming to the beach, Sinbad is met by a dark-cloaked man, who demands his amulet. Sinbad narrowly escapes into the city, where the city guard forces the hostile stranger to flee. Soon, Sinbad encounters the Grand Vizier of Marabia (Douglas Wilmer). The Vizier, who wears a golden mask to hide his disfigured face, says that Sinbad's amulet is actually one piece of a puzzle; the Vizier has another. The Vizier relates to Sinbad a legend that the three pieces, when joined together, will reveal a map showing the way to the Fountain of Destiny, hidden somewhere on the lost continent of Lemuria. The legend tells that he who bears the three pieces of the puzzle to the fountain will receive ""youth, a shield of darkness, and a crown of untold riches.""Sinbad agrees to help the Vizier find the fountain. They join forces against Prince Koura (Tom Baker), the black-cloaked man who is an evil magician bent on conquering Marabia. Koura had locked the Vizier in a room and set it on fire, horribly burning his face. The creature that dropped the gold tablet was one of Koura's minions, a homunculus created by his black magic. Using this creature he hears the conversation, and it turns to ash when it is found.Shortly afterward, Sinbad meets the girl he saw in his dream, Margiana (Caroline Munro), a slave-girl. Her master hires Sinbad to make a man of his lazy, no-good son Haroun (Kurt Christian), and Sinbad agrees on the condition that Margiana goes with him; so the two new passengers and the Vizier board Sinbad's ship. Koura hires a ship and crew of his own and follows Sinbad, using his magic several times to try to stop Sinbad. However, each attempt drains away part of his life force and he ages noticeably each time.Along his journey, Sinbad fights the wooden siren figurehead from his own ship which Koura has animated, which steals the map, enabling Koura to find the Island. However Sinbad has memorised the map. Koura gets to the Island and uses another homunculus to hear the Oracle of All Knowledge (an uncredited Robert Shaw) as it describes to Sinbad what he will face. Koura then seals the men inside the cave, however Sinbad is able to escape with a rope and get the others out. The Homunculus is killed with an arrow as it tries to stop Sinbad. Koura animates a six-armed Kali idol when he is captured by hostile natives, causing them to free him. However, Sinbad and his men arrive and fight and defeat Kali. The natives capture Sinbad and his crew and give Margiana to a one-eyed centaur, the fountain's guardian of evil. Sinbad and the others escape when the Vizier shows his burnt face, scaring the natives. The Centaur fights (and kills) the guardian of good, a griffin, with Koura's help, however Sinbad then stabs it dead. Once they reach the fountain, Koura obtains all the pieces, assembles the puzzle, and drops it in the fountain. His health is restored and he becomes invisible (the ""shield of darkness""). However, he is slain in a sword duel by Sinbad, who then takes the ""crown of untold riches"" that rises out of the fountain and gives it to the Grand Vizier. Sinbad explains to Margiana that he values freedom more, and a king is never really free. The crown's magic powers causes the Vizer's mask to dissolve to reveal his healed face, and Sinbad journeys back to Marabia with Haroun, who has proven himself during the adventure, as a new crew member and Margiana by his side."

He then tells Burt he is going to Chicago to visit Shirley, Burt's sister, but before he leaves he stops at a city morgue to identify the body of Jacob, who has died with no relatives. Harry cries after recalling Jacob's story of losing his virginity.Burt takes Harry to the airport, but Harry soon learns that he can't go through security with Tonto, so he takes a cab to get a bus. Along the route, Harry asks the bus driver to stop so that Tonto can relieve himself, whereupon the cat runs away across a cemetery. The bus driver leaves Harry behind with his luggage, and when Tonto returns, Harry scolds him.Harry walks to a used car lot and buys an old Chevy for $250. He then checks into a motel and calls Burt to tell him what has happened, realizing in the process that his driver's license expired in 1958.Harry drives west rather slowly, with Tonto on the dashboard, recalling how he wanted to drive across the country when he was younger, but his wife and kids came along. He remembers they had many good times though. He confesses to Tonto that he has a great fear of pain, and that when he dies he would like to go quickly rather than the slow way his wife Annie died.Harry picks up two young hitchhikers, one of whom soon gets another ride, while the other a girl named Ginger continues west with Harry. She claims she is 16, and is running away from home to a commune in Boulder.Harry and Ginger get a motel for the night, and after she comes out of the bathroom half-naked, Harry is prompted to recall the first girl he loved, Jessie, whom he has not seen in 50 years. Ginger suggests that they go to see her, even though it's out of their way, and they eventually find her in a nursing home.At first Harry thinks Jessie remembers him, but her thoughts are marked by senility; she calls him Alex yet remembers his wife Annie. Then she suddenly asks Harry to dance, which they do while Ginger looks on.Harry and Ginger make it to Chicago, where Shirley runs a bookstore. Harry is surprised to see Norman there, who has been sent in advance by Burt to meet him, and who is now talking. Shirley is curt with Harry and Ginger, and is mourning the end of her fourth marriage.Shirley and Harry go for a walk by the edge of Lake Michigan, and she encourages him to return to teaching; he says he is too old. They have an awkward exchange, and agree to be more civil to each other.Harry drives on with Norman and Ginger, reaching Arizona. Harry calls Burt and has Norman explain his situation, which does not go over well. Harry tells Burt he is moving on to Los Angeles to visit Eddie, his other son, while Norman tells Burt that he is going with Ginger to Boulder.Harry thus gives the car to them, and wonders off to a motel, where he meets a traveling salesman of natural health products. While the man gives Harry a shoulder rub, he sells him a blender he does not need.Harry hitchhikes and is picked up by hot redhead in convertible. She reveals she's a high-priced hooker, and asks Harry how long it's been since he had sex. He stammers, saying he does not think he's up to it and can't afford her, but when he mentions he has $100, she drives off the road and takes him up a hillside.The hooker drops Harry off at a Las Vegas casino, where he has some drinks. A man at a craps table gets mad at him for cooling his win streak. Harry goes outside to give Tonto some milk, and begins to urinate against the building, whereupon police arrest him.Harry wakes up in jail with a native Indian named Sam Two Feathers. Harry offers him the blender he recently bought, and Sam gives him a necklace in exchange. Harry asks Sam if he can cure ailments, and in exchange for relieving Harry of the bursitis in his shoulder, Sam selects a pair of Harry's underwear.Harry finally makes it by bus to L.A., and walks along Hollywood Blvd. with Tonto, until his son Eddie drives by to pick him up. Eddie acts as if he's been living off his real estate deals, but when they get to his apartment, he confesses to his father that he is broke.Eddie cries in shame, and Harry consoles him that they will somehow find a way to help each other financially. Harry can provide some money for now, he says, but he wants Eddie to get on with his own life.Harry goes to the beach and enjoys a game a chess, during which Tonto suddenly does not look well.Harry takes Tonto to an animal hospital, and says goodbye.Harry goes to the beach to write a letter to Leroy, telling him that Tonto passed away at the age of 11, or 77 in human years. A woman named Celia, escorting many cats, comes to sit next to Harry, openly flirting with him. She soon suggests that they run around together, but Harry is distracted when he sees a tabby cat that looks like Tonto.Harry follows the cat out onto the beach and pets it. There he sees a little girl building a sandcastle in the sunset, and he joins her."

The one-eyed lord Yagyu Retsudo (wearing a black eye-patch since being wounded by Itto in the fourth film 'Lone Wolf and Cub: Baby Cart in Peril') sends his daughter and last remaining child Kaori, an expert with flying daggers, to kill them.Kaori then tries to ambush Itto along a road, but the stone-faced ronin kills her with little difficulty. After she is killed, Retsudo attempts to use the Tsuchigumo, a secretive mountain clan that practices black magic and is commanded by Hyouei, an illegitimate son of Retsudo who is determined to cause the downfall of the Yagyu by killing Itto and Daigoro himself. Hyouei sends his three most fearsome followers, whose abilities include the ability to burrow through the earth and who kill anyone Itto and Daigoro come into contact with.Faced with such supernatural enemies, Itto (for the first time in the film series) is afraid of being finished off at any time. But he quickly decides to beat them at their own strategy by fleeting northward to the snow-covered region of northern Japan during the winter season where the Tsuchigumo will be at a disadvantage since they cannot appear to burrow through ice and snow.After Itto defeats Hyouei and kills the three supernatural Tsuchigumo, the story culminates in a final battle between Itto and the combined clan groups under Retsudo on a snow-capped mountain in northern Japan, in which the baby cart becomes a sled. Retsudo, now leading an army of Shogun warriors, around 1,000 strong, confront Itto on a mountain ridge. Once again, (as in the third film 'Lone Wolf and Cub: Baby Cart to Hades') Itto transforms the baby cart to a weapon with his machine gun, spears, daggers and swords. In a final combat, Itto defeats the entire army, shooting, stabbing, slashing, dismembering and beheading the entire army.

tt0071746,"['Biography', 'Drama']","In an interview, Honey Harlow Bruce (Valerie Perrine), ex-wife of stand-up comic Lenny Bruce (Dustin Hoffman), recalls her life with him:In 1964, Lenny shocks his audience by stating that Eleanor Roosevelt gave Lou Gehrig ""the clap,"" but then says the real point he wants to make is about the suppression of words. Venereal disease he says, is an epidemic because people will not talk about it.Honey then recalls seeing Lenny for the first time in Baltimore, when he was a comic impersonator:In the early 1950s, Honey, a stripper known as Hot Honey Harlow, is eating in a cafeteria when she sees Lenny watching her from across the room. The next time Lenny and Honey see each other, they go off together to have sex. Afterward, the smitten Lenny calls Honey his ""shiksa goddess"" and follows her to Miami.In another interview, Artie Silver (Stanley Beck), Lenny's manager, discusses the delicate balance of involving himself in both Lenny's professional and personal life:Shortly after Lenny and Honey meet, Artie warns Lenny that Honey, who had done jail time as a teenager, would be trouble. Despite Artie's misgivings, Lenny marries Honey, then takes her to meet his mother, Sally Marr (Jan Miner), and her sister Aunt Mema (Rashel Novikoff). Later, Lenny, who is uncomfortable with Honey's stripping, adds her to his act. They are hired to perform in the Catskills, where, during a show, Lenny makes an impulsive, crude joke to the band that is overheard by the audience. After this incidence, Sherman Hart (Gary Morton), an established comic, advises Lenny not to use ""dirt"" in his routines, but, at his next performance, Lenny intentionally insults his audience, thus losing career opportunities.In a 1960s performance, Lenny asks his audience, ""What is dirty?"" He says he would rather his child watch a stag movie than 'The King of Kings' , because nobody gets hurt in porn.In a flashback to 1950s, Honey is seriously injured and, while in the hospital, guesses that Lenny has an affair with her nurse. This incident becomes the source of a routine Lenny performs a decade later, in which Lenny advises men to deny their indiscretions at all costs, even if their wives catch them in the act. Explaining the difference between men and women, Lenny says that a woman is physical with someone she likes, but a man will seek out anything, even on a desert island.In the 1950s, the couple moves to Los Angeles, Honey returns to stripping, Lenny to small gigs and they become involved in the show business drug culture. Lenny pushes to experiment sexually, but then accuses Honey of enjoying the other woman in their ménage a trois ""too much."" In her interview, Honey recalls that after their daughter, Kitty, was born, she and Lenny parted.During his stand-up act in the 1960s, Lenny says that ""divorce is great at first, but then you realize the women you meet are also divorced and burdened with children or poodles"". He claims the only satisfaction is the revenge of gaining child custody, but then you are responsible for getting up in the morning to raise the child.In her interview, Honey at first accuses Lenny of stealing Kitty, but then admits she had a problem with drug abuse:In the late 1950s, Honey, an emotional wreck from loneliness and drugs, calls Lenny collect from Hawaii, where she has been arrested for possession of marijuana.In a 1960s performance, Lenny explains that the problem is that we live in a ""happy ending"" culture instead of a ""what is"" culture. He thinks that true human responses are denied and lied about, causing people to feel guilty when they act in a natural way.In an interview, Sally says that she moved to California to help with Kitty, and that Lenny had by then given up impersonation and begun to improvise:In the late 1950s, Lenny works in strip clubs, content that no one censors his act. Eventually, Artie and Sally convince him to take engagements at college and political venues, where his irreverence soon becomes trendy. During a performance, Lenny risks audience alienation by boldly referring to individuals using racial epithets. Then, explaining that suppression gives words power, he advocates using offensive words until they can no longer cause pain. When a Time magazine reporter suggests that Lenny's act has social impact, Lenny denies it, saying he likes attention and wants to ""make a buck."" Now, Artie commands high fees for Lenny's appearances.During one performance, Lenny says that he has been accused of making ""sick jokes,"" but that a true sick joke is that Zsa Zsa Gabor earns $60,000 a week in Las Vegas and a Nevada school teacher's top pay is $6,000 a year. After wisecracking about masturbation and integration, Lenny says his financial success is based on violence, segregation, disease, despair and injustice, and if the world suddenly became pure, he would be unemployed. When he visits Honey in prison, he shows her an album cover of a recording of some of his performances.At an appearance in San Francisco, Lenny protests the dismissal of homosexual teachers, saying the men were considered good at their jobs and their actions occurred far from school grounds. Because of one of his crudely worded comments, Lenny is arrested and charged with the use of an obscene word in a public place.During his interview, Artie recalls that Lenny became obsessed with his legal battles and would read court transcripts to his audience:At Lenny's trial without jury in San Francisco, the judge orders a continuance and cautions Lenny not to repeat any of ""those words.""At Lenny's next performance, after pointing out to the audience several uniformed and plainclothes policemen posted around the room, Lenny talks about his arrest, substituting the sounds, ""blah blah blah,"" for provocative words. When the trial resumes, the humorless judge finds Lenny guilty, after which his counsel requests a jury trial.In his interview, Artie states that Lenny began to study law books and record his trials:During the appeal trial, his lawyer forces the arresting policeman to admit that one of the words that Lenny is being charged for saying in public is often used at the police station, which also is a public place. Then his lawyer suggests that Lenny's work is found in the social satire of Aristophanes and Jonathan Swift. A professor of religion testifies that Lenny's routines convey a sincere message that exposes hypocrisy. A recording of a performance is played, one in which Lenny riffs on the phrase, ""to come,"" and arranges his words into a kind of beat poem. Although the judge is offended, the jury votes for acquittal. Lenny, however, is dissatisfied, feeling that he won because of the jury's idiosyncrasies rather than the acknowledgment of First Amendment rights.According to Artie's later recollection, Lenny, who added jokes about the Pope and other religious leaders to his routines, developed a following, although some people attended shows just to see if he got arrested. After Honey is released from prison, she and Lenny spend time together taking drugs. Artie and Sally try to cancel Lenny's Chicago performance, but when the manager refuses, the drug-addled, coughing Lenny goes onstage. After an attempt at coherence, he apologizes, admitting he is not funny. Backstage, the police arrest him.In the present, Honey recalls that Lenny was arrested a total of 13 times, and Sally states that he suffered from pleurisy. Artie says Lenny dealt with depression, and was going broke from lawyer and doctor bills. In a performance at the height of his career, Lenny tells the audience that there has been an ""obscenity circus"" for years, starring the district attorney and the lower and Supreme Courts, and that he is the ""schmuck"" who fell off the high wire into the ring. As he wonders aloud why it is permissible to show photographs of maimed breasts injured in war, but not the beautiful breasts of a lovely woman in the audience, a policeman rises to arrest him.At the trial, words Lenny has spoken are presented out of context and a gesture he used is incorrectly stated to signify masturbation. Increasingly frustrated, Lenny speaks out, asking to talk to the judge and jury as human to human, but his interruptions anger the judge. Expecting a guilty verdict, his defense team plans to appeal to a higher court, but Lenny, no longer thinking clearly, is uncooperative. He tries defending himself, but the judge declares him in contempt of court. Lenny states that he has no money left and his cabaret card, which allows him to perform, has been confiscated. As he is removed from the courtroom, Lenny claims he hurts no one and pleads that they do not take away his words.In her interview, Sally says the New York court found Lenny guilty, but an appeal was being planned by his defense team. When the interviewer suggests the possibility of suicide, Sally denies it. Honey describes Lenny as funny, and Artie, pleased that Lenny's records are selling again, states that he is negotiating a film about his life. Intrigued, the interviewer mentions that Lenny's speeches are now-after less than a decade-considered harmless.Back in 1966, when Lenny is found dead in his apartment, naked, with drug paraphernalia nearby, the police allow news photographers to film his death scene."

Upon discovering their car has been towed, they walk through the night to an impound yard and spend most of their money to collect the vehicle.Back on the road, the brothers stop at a diner, but when two redneck police officers come in to eat, Wayne escapes through the bathroom window. After Chris pays for his meal, he jumps in the car and the brothers race off, stiffing the waitress for Wayne's bill.

Scaramanga and Anders leave the beach, a short time later a gangster, Rodney, arrives and is met by Nick-Nack, a dwarf who works as a servant for Scaramanga. Rodney has been hired by Nick-Nack to kill Scaramanga, who has promised to leave everything he owns to his small servant. The gangster stalks Scaramanga through a funhouse-like wing of his home. Scaramanga has been caught without his gun and must find it first. He does so and is able to kill his would-be assassin first. Nick-Nack jovially tells Scaramanga he will find an adversary that will beat his master; the two seem to have an unspoken agreement that humors them both. Scaramanga picks up the gangster's gun and turns suddenly, shooting the fingers off a nearby wax dummy of James Bond.MI6's top agent, James Bond, has been called to the office of his boss, M. M asks what Bond knows about Scaramanga, to which Bond recites a laundry list of characteristics, the most important being that Scaramanga charges $1 million per assassination, uses gold bullets marked with then name of his target and is known as ""The Man with the golden gun."" M shows Bond a gold bullet, assumed to be one of Scaramanga's, marked with Bond's service number, ""007"" and a partial fingerprint of the villain's. Bond is puzzled as to why anyone would want him killed and M orders him to travel to Beirut.In Beirut, Bond speaks with an exotic dancer who is the last person to see a fellow agent 002 alive who had allegedly been killed by Scaramanga. Bond finds that the woman has kept the gold bullet since her lover's death and uses it as a lucky charm which she holds in her navel. A small group of thugs break into her dressing room and Bond, in the middle of kissing the woman's abdomen, swallows the bullet. He takes it back to Q who, along with an metallurgist, is able to identify the manufacturer, a man named Lazar who lives in Macau. Bond is sent there to investigate and, while threatening Lazar, is shown an order for more of the gold bullets to be delivered shortly. Bond accompanies Lazar to the drop point, a local casino, where they are picked up by Andrea Anders.Bond trails Anders to Hong Kong but loses her at the hydrofoil port. He meets his assistant, Mary Goodnight. Bond finds out where Anders is staying and enters her hotel room and roughly interrogates her, citing the bullet sent to MI6 with his number on it. She admits she works for Scaramanga, both as a courier but also as his lover; Scaramanga, like a bullfighter, uses her for sex before he makes a kill. Bond also finds out that Scaramanga is due to be at the Bottoms Up exotic dancers club that night. While staking the club, Bond sees Nick-Nack nearby. As he watches, a man exits the club and is immediately shot by Scaramanga, who is hiding nearby. The man, Gibson, is a solar energy expert. Bond is arrested by Lieutenant Hip as a suspect in the murder. Hip takes Bond to the rusted hulk of the RMS Queen Elizabeth (actually ruined by fire in 1972) in Hong Kong harbor, which turns out to be MI6's base of Asian Operations; M is there. Bond is informed that Gibson's invention, the Solex Agitator, a small but powerful device used to convert solar energy into electricity, had been stolen from him immediately after the shooting. Scaramanga had been hired to kill Gibson by a Chinese gangster, Hai Fat. Because Fat had never met Scaramanga face-to-face, Bond is able to impersonate the killer; he even has Q supply him with a fake third nipple, one of Scaramanga's known physical characteristics.Bond travels to Bangkok and Fat's home. Fat invites Bond back to his house for dinner that evening, however, Bond is unaware that Scaramanga himself has already met with Fat in person. Fat arranges for Bond to be killed when he arrives. When Bond shows up at Fat's place, he is subdued and captured by Nick-Nack & two sumo wrestlers. Nick-Nack nearly stabs Bond but is stopped by Fat, who sends Bond to a nearby martial arts dojo. The class' best student engages Bond in combat but Bond defeats him and jumps through a window. Hip arrives with his nieces, who beat the students with their own skill at martial arts. When they jump in Hip's car, they take off without Bond, who must escape using a high-powered canal boat, chased by Thai long-tail boats, and comically assisted by a chance run-in with Sheriff Pepper (from Live and Let Die) who is vacationing in Thailand with his wife.Back at Hai Fat's house Scaramanga kills the gangster (the gun he uses is assembled from personal items such as a ball point pen, cigarette lighter and a cuff link) and takes control of his assets. Bond plans to spend a romantic evening with Goodnight at their hotel room but they are interrupted by Anders. Bond sleeps with her and she confesses she is afraid of Scaramanga. She asks Bond to kill him. Bond says he will do so but only in exchange for the Solex. Bond goes to a kickboxing match where Anders is waiting. She is dead, having been killed in public by Scaramanga, who had discovered her betrayal. Scaramanga introduces himself to Bond, while Nick-Nack covers him with a tiny pistol. Scaramanga tells of his circus up-bringing, how he made his first kill, and warns Bond not to follow him, while Bond locates the Solex on the floor among the spilled contents of Anders' purse, and covertly passes it to Hip, disguised as a peanut seller. Hip passes the Solex to Goodnight, waiting outside. Scaramanga and Nick-Nack leave the arena, but find Goodnight trying to plant a tracking device in Scaramanga's car and lock her in the trunk. Bond pursues in a stolen car. He chases Scaramanga along a canal and nearly loses him when Scaramanga mysteriously appears on the other side of the water. Not able to find a suitable bridge nearby, Bond drives his car across a wrecked bridge, executing a corkscrew jump and landing on the other bank. Meanwhile, Scaramanga reaches a barn where his car is converted into a plane and takes off, Goodnight still in the trunk. Bond is again arrested. Goodnight's tracking unit informs MI6 and Bond that Scaramanga has returned to his private island off the coast of China (actually the Khao Phing Kan archipelago on the west coast of Thailand). Bond flies there under radar and lands. He is met by Nick-Nack and Scaramanga and given a tour of the facility. Scaramanga shows how the Solex provides power for his compound. Though he doesn't understand the science involved, Scaramanga knows the applications can extend to weapons; he destroys Bond's sea plane with a blast from a laser weapon in his control room. Scaramanga plans to hand over the Solex technology to whomever pays him the highest price for it. He also reveals that he has long desired to duel with Bond to see whom is the better marksman. Bond agrees to the match.The two face off with Scaramanga stalking Bond through his compound and Nick-Nack keeping tabs on the match from a control console. After several minutes of both gunmen evading each other, Bond gains the advantage by taking the place of the wax dummy that resembles him; Scaramanga enters the room and is shot dead by Bond. In the meantime, Goodnight has subdued the bodyguard Scaramanga had posted in the electric generator room and the man falls into a vat of liquid nitrogen. The change in temperature upsets the balance needed to maintain production and the compound begins to self-destruct. Bond is able to regain the Solex and he and Goodnight escape the compound before its destruction.To reach civilization, Bond takes Scaramanga's personal junk and leaves the island with Goodnight. On the boat, finally able to enjoy some romantic time alone, they are attacked by Nick-Nack, who begins a surprisingly furious battle with Bond. Bond is able to trap the diminutive servant in a suitcase and takes him on deck. When he returns, Goodnight is horrified, thinking that Bond threw the midget overboard, however, Bond has locked him in a small cage. As they begin their romantic encounter again, Bond and Goodnight are once again interrupted by a call from M, which the two ignore."
tt0071824,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","About an hour before dawn just outside Seattle in 1973, a man dons sunglasses and fits a silencer to a pistol. He then drives into the city and eventually to a corner where a policeman sees his car and approaches - and is promptly shot dead by the man. He then drives to a police impound lot where another officer, Wally Johnson, is parking a car; the killer shoots him dead. The killer then drives to a corner coffee shop; as he washes his hands his police badge briefly appears, indicating he is a dirty cop. The shop proprietor greets him, for he is Stan Boyle, a detective sergeant. While the proprietor goes to the kitchen, Boyle sees a car pull up outside; he goes to the car and gives the driver a carrying case with the murder weapon inside - but as he returns to his own car the driver shoots him down with a shotgun then escapes.Boyle's partner is Lon McQ, a lieutenant, and after being noisily awakened by his telephone on his dockside houseboat, McQ learns from police Sergeant J.C. Davis of the shootings. McQ deduces the shootings to be the work of Manuel Santiago, a businessman who fronts for massive shipments of narcotics from Canada. McQ's suspicion about Santiago is hardened when he is fired on near his car by a hit-man who he shoots dead and identifies as Patty Samuels.McQ visits the hospital where Boyle is in critical condition and comforts Boyle's wife Lois. He asks her about the previous night where they were attending a show and Stan got a phone call to leave. After his questioning he drives to police headquarters where his superior, Captain Ed Kosterman, has rounded up street radicals he believes may be responsible for the shootings; here he greets city councilman Franklin Toms, who is close to him as well as the Boyles.McQ greets Kosterman in the station commissary and Ed orders McQ not to harass Santiago, pointedly reminding him of a previous case where a hood was brutally assaulted by McQ and the police had to deal with backlash from several lawyers. McQ blows him off and drives to Santiago's harbor-side business where he photographs him greeting a suspicious type just before he drives to a downtown diner. It is there that a news broadcast reveals that Stan Boyle has died of his shotgun injuries; when Santiago goes to the restroom and uses a payphone to inform someone of Boyle's death, McQ jumps him and rams him head-first into the mirror then punches him unconscious and dumps him in the trough.For this McQ is taken off duty and assigned to a desk until further notice by police brass, but instead of taking this punishment McQ angrily quits the force, though he gives J.C. Davis the roll of film on Santiago and tells him to get an identification on the suspect with Santiago. Days later following Boyle's funeral Lois comes by McQ's houseboat where he comforts her and she suggests they get in his ""Green Hornet,"" a flashy Pontiac TransAm, and just drive away.Later McQ shows up at the office of Pinky Farrell, a private detective, and asks to join him; he wants to investigate Boyle's murder and Santiago's supposed role in it and not be held up by the police umbrella. Farrell reluctantly agrees to register McQ, and at police headquarters J.C. gives him the photos he took, identifying the man with Santiago as Freddie LaSalle, a hit-man from St. Louis. McQ later borrows $5,000 from his ex-wife Elaine, who still holds Lon in her heart and remembers the fear for his life that drove her away.That night at a Seattle Supersonics game Lon confronts Rosey, an informant who wants nothing to do with him anymore since he's not on the force; Lon shows him a newspaper with some of the $5,000, and Rosey tells him that Santiago has brought in three hit-men for a drug heist. Lon then greets Myra, a waitress who was an informant of Boyle and may have been closer to him that just that; she is an addict and Lon gives her a line for her to inhale; she agrees to tell him that she knows about Santiago's hit team and that they intend to steal from the police.Lon follows a state police detail transferring several million dollars worth of powder to an incineration plant, but Santiago's hit team, disguised as part of a laundry service, jumps them and steals the power, but have to fire on Lon as he pursues them to their laundry truck. Lon chases them in his Pontiac and catches up to and corners a laundry truck, but it turns out to be a different one.Kosterman is doubly furious at Lon for the shootout and for not informing the police beforehand as well as at Franklin Toms, who defends Lon to Kosterman. Kosterman revokes Lon's gun permit before leading a sweep of Santiago's house and business to find the powder; Lon for his part purchases another gun anyway, then is told by his friend Jack, the gun shop owner, about a new sub-machine weapon, the Ingram, a 9 mm weapon that fires 20 rounds per second. Lon is so impressed with the Ingram after test firing it on a trashcan of water he borrows the weapon and half a dozen magazines of ammo. He then drives to Lois' house for a drink before getting a phone call from J.C. Davis that the police search turned up nothing. Lon, though, knows better, and that Santiago has driven the junk around before stashing it where the police already searched - his office.Yet it blows up in Lon's face when he finds the powder in Santiago's office but is cornered by his gunmen and then learns from the furious Santiago that the powder he stole is in fact harmless sugar. Clearly the drugs were switched with sugar by certain officials, and now Lon realizes Santiago never was involved in the killing of Boyle or the other two officers. Santiago, with nothing to fear from Lon, lets him go, but first beats him up as revenge.Lon now suspects Kosterman may be involved, but gets more shocking news when he confronts his informant Rosey and Rosey reveals that Boyle himself was a dirty cop. Lon initially doesn't believe it, but after seeing Myra she herself is shot to death by a gunman who thinks she knows something. Lon himself is then attacked when two trucks crush his Pontiac between them. Lon is questioned about the attempt on his life by J.C., who reveals where the wrecked car is being held.Lon now realizes something about his car, and when he sneaks into the impound yard both to retrieve the Ingram weapon and to search the car he finds traces of cocaine - the cocaine switched with sugar earlier. Now Lon realizes his friend was indeed dirty - some time earlier he'd loaned Stan his car for a day, and this was how Stan switched the sugar and cocaine - but the police now suspect he himself is involved, so he must hot-wire a car to escape, then finds Lois, who is packing to visit her folks upstate; Lon drives with her and reveals that her husband was dirty - but that others close to him are involved, all leading to a confrontation involving Santiago and a lengthy high speed pursuit along a stretch of beach."
tt0071851,"['Drama', 'Romance']","(It's over 30 years since I saw the film, so there will be gaps and mistakes.)
A weary and depressed middle-aged man visits a holiday resort on the English coast at the edges of the holiday season. Beaches and fairground rides are nearly deserted but for him. As he wanders the town and returns to the hotel which he had visited with his parents when he was a child, fragments of those early happy days return to him as flashbacks of memory. Coming into the hotel, an attractive young woman brushes past him, dashing out of the hotel door. He continues into the hotel and books a room.Going to his room, he slumps down on the bed by the window, and takes out a pistol, which he gradually loads. There's a clatter of feet down the stairs outside his door, and a knock. He puts away the pistol and, going to the door, finds the girl he had bumped into. She asks him to help her with the gas fire in her room.Their lives get twined together, they become lovers, and the town becomes happy for him again. She tells him that she has come here, to get away from her boy friend. She finds out from him that he had intended to shoot himself when he came here, as his life had become so empty; she persuades him not to, and asks him to come and visit her when she gets back to London.Coming back to the hotel one day, the hotel porter gives her a message from her boy friend; he wants to meet her again. Suddenly, she's flustered and happy and distracted, almost forgetting her companion. They go up to her room, where she starts rushing around, packing. He moves to the window, listening to her voice, and sees that from her window she can see directly into his room, to the bedside where he had sat loading his pistol, days ago. .... and he realises why she had come knocking on his door those days ago, to distract him.As she carries on talking and packing, he fades from her room and makes his way back to his room, where he takes out his pistol again. She comes rushing into his room, telling him that she's got to hurry, he must visit her in London, and tosses a rolled up sketch/painting on his bed as she leaves. As her footsteps die away, the roll of paper on the bed disappears and we realise that this whole love story, from the moment he first sat on the bed after she brushed past him at the front door of the hotel, has been just a dream, a wistful wish for love. And the camera pans back up from the hotel window until we hear the gun shot."
tt0071853,"['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy']","The credits are rolled to deeply ominous music with several false starts, interlaced with apologies for the inadequacies of each, during which numerous titlers are fired en masse. In the end, credits that are heavily laced with references to moose, llamas and other furry animals roll to highly festive Latin music.Little is to be seen but fog over a grassland while the sound of a galloping horse&mdash;a sound that could only be made on cobblestone, but not grass&mdash;is heard. From the fog emerge two pedestrians: King Arthur (Graham Chapman), dressed in chain mail, a tunic and a crown; and Patsy (Terry Gilliam), who appears to be fulfilling the role of beast of burden, and is using two half-coconuts percussively.They approach a castle and Patsy perfectly mimics the sound of a galloping horse coming to a stop. Two guards become barely visible atop the castle wall. Arthur announces that he is looking for knights to join him at Camelot, and wishes to recruit the master of the castle. Unfortunately, the two guards are immediately distracted by Patsy's half-coconut shells. Arthur tries to return the conversation to the quest, but the guards are unable to turn their attentions from the possible causes for coconuts appearing in Mercia (England), as Arthur claims that they found them there, or how a bird, or a set of birds, might have brought one up from the tropics. Frustrated, Arthur and Patsy emulate riding off.The scene changes to a plague village. A cart is being drawn through the streets, and is attended by a disheveled man (Eric Idle) who strikes a triangle and calls for the residents to ""bring out your dead."" A peasant (John Cleese) tries to lay a decrepit man on the cart, without calling attention to the fact that he is still alive. The attendant refuses to accept living cargo (citing regulations). When the peasant tries to abstractly request a favour, the attendant looks up and down the street to make sure there are no witnesses, and strikes the elderly subject a deadly blow to the head, solving the problem. The cart and the peasant continue on their ways. Arthur and Patsy emulate a ride through the village, and the attendant correctly infers that Arthur is a king from the fact that he is not covered in shit.On a hillside, near a castle, Arthur approaches a peasant (Michael Palin) from behind and calls out ""Old woman!"" The peasant, Dennis, barely turns his head to correct the king with ""man!"" Rather than killing this vulgar subject on the spot for such gross insubordination, Arthur tries to apologize for the mistake. Unimpressed, Dennis then launches into a rant, making it very clear that he has harboured a great deal of bitterness over the class system, which he has experienced from the bottom all his life (of 37 years). Arthur is challenged to justify his kingship, and to an accompaniment of heavenly voices, tells the tale of the Lady of the Lake presenting Arthur with Excalibur. Dennis confidently challenges this presumption of political legitimacy. Focusing on the executive branch, he asserts that it must ""derive from a mandate from the masses."" Arthur can only respond by barking orders that the peasant be silent. Unaffected, Dennis continues his elocution of democratic dogma, at which point Arthur manhandles him. This only encourages Dennis; he becomes a raving firebrand, and tries to call as much attention as possible to Arthur's assault. The king accepts that he cannot adequately assert this authority in this situation, and relinquishes Dennis with ""Bloody peasant!"" Dennis, despite his anger, appears delighted at this parting shot, and its significance to his message. He seeks validation from the gathering crowd.While travelling through a forest, Arthur and Patsy encounter an epic battle between two armoured, faceless men. The weapons: swords, an anointed mace, and an axe. When the black-clad knight (John Cleese) runs his opponent through the face, he retrieves his sword and then simply stands tall. Arthur approaches him and praises him for his performance. The knight neither speaks a word, nor even turns his gaze towards the king. Despite this insolence, Arthur again does not respond with homicide, but invites the knight to enter his court. When no response is given, Arthur announces that he will continue on his quest. The knight then speaks with a deep voice and economy of words, repeating ""None shall pass,"" forbidding Arthur to cross the bridge before which he is standing. This bridge would allow the party to cross a gully no more than 10 feet wide. Arthur and the knight draw their swords, and a much less epic battle ensues. When Arthur severs one of the knight's arms, he is unwilling to accept defeat. Arthur relieves the knight of his other arm and kneels down to offer a prayer of thanks. The knight kicks him over. The now completely unarmed knight drops his ominous mystique, and childishly goads Arthur into chopping off his remaining limbs. As the knight can no longer obstruct Arthur, he and Patsy ride off, ignoring the knight's continued challenges.A group of monks are chanting in Latin while hitting themselves with wooden boards as they traverse a village which looks much like the plague village. A frenzied mob drags a lady accused of being a witch (Connie Booth) to Bedevere (Terry Jones), who is performing an experiment involving a coconut tied to a bird. They present their case based on the way she is dressed, the funnel on her head, and the parsnip tied over her nose. They also present testimony from a peasant (John Cleese) who had been turned into a newt (or so he claims). Bedevere proceeds to deduce the validity of their charge in his own way, after making the villagers admit that they put a fake nose on the witch. Using a scientific method befitting the Dark Ages of Europe, he develops a formula for identifying a witch based on the flammability and buoyancy of various objects and materials. The crowd becomes very quiet and still, probably because Bedevere is overtaxing their intelligence. It is eventually reasoned that the weight of the accused compared to that of a duck determines whether she is a witch. Remembering their original purpose, they return to their frenzy and carry her off to be weighed. As she is heavier than a duck, she is taken to be burnt as a witch. Right afterwards, Arthur approaches Bedevere. When Arthur identifies himself, Bedevere bows to the king, and is then knighted&mdash;Camelot has its first knight.We are hurried through the recruitment of the remaining knights by the Book of the Film. They are Sir Lancelot the Brave (John Cleese), Sir Galahad the Pure (Michael Palin) (also called ""the Chaste""), Sir Robin the-not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot (Eric Idle), and the aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film (a baby (William Palin) suited up in chain mail).The party emulates riding to Camelot and when they spy it from a distance, they stop to appreciate its majesty. We are treated to a song and dance routine performed by the knights, presumably within the castle walls. This includes an interlude with tap-dancing, and a percussion solo. Even the decrepit shell of a man (Mark Zycon) suspended by his wrists in the dungeon below manages to pathetically cheer the upbeat celebrations upstairs. We are then returned to the outside of Camelot, at the same distance from the castle. Arthur seems to have had the same perception we have just had, since he elects to avoid Camelot, calling it a ""silly place.""As Arthur and company ride to some unknown destination, a low-budget animation of the Almighty appears in the sky. He is not willing to suffer fools gladly, and when done chastising Arthur for his obsequiousness, charges Arthur with seeking the Holy Grail. Thus, the Quest for the Holy Grail begins, as manifested by another animation sequence with images reminiscent of medieval art.Our heroes encounter a castle with a French taunter (John Cleese) who taunts them with random names like ""Daffy English knights"" (unaware that ""knight"" has silent letters, and only one ""n"") and makes up flowery insults such as ""I fart in your general direction!"" and ""Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries!"" Whether this man is French is unclear, since his French-talking colleagues appear to understand English words more readily than French ones, and his accent slips when shouting ""I'm French!"" Arthur gives the same terms to the inhabitants of the castle as he did with the first one he approached, including, of course, the part involving the Grail. The Frenchman claims that they already have a grail, but then indicates to his peers that this is a mischievous fabrication. Half-stunned, Arthur asks to see it. The guard rejects the request with his typical inane derision. Arthur then takes a more aggressive posture, and in mid-threat, the French launch a cow from what sounds like a catapult at Arthur's party, landing on one of them. With all possible gusto, Arthur orders a charge, and they all attack the castle walls (several feet high) with nothing more effective than swords. Arthur's party is treated to a barrage of livestock. Arthur orders a retreat, but since he does not know the meaning of the word, he uses a different expression. The taunter hears battle noises, but there is nothing to see. Sir Bedevere's keen mind hatches a plan: a giant hare made of wood known as a Trojan Rabbit is wheeled towards the castle. The French understand that it is intended as a present for them, and then cautiously bring it into the castle. Sir Bedevere explains the remainder of his plans... but at this point he realizes that he forgot the step where the knights are supposed to climb into the rabbit, before it is to be presented to the enemy. Using the same technology as before, the wooden colossus is sent over the castle walls, killing one of the servants (Neil Innes).A clapperboard is snapped in front of ""a famous historian"" (John Young) wearing a modern suit and tie, who narrates some unseen details of Arthur's experience with the French, and then informs us that the king decided that he and his knights should search for the Grail individually. Anything else he was going to tell us is cut short when an unidentified knight on horseback slashes his neck. The historian's wife shows up crying for help.After they split up, Sir Robin travels through a forest with his favourite minstrels. The vocal one sings of Robin's bravery, and describes in graphic detail the various ordeals that Robin is prepared to face. Just as the minstrel is about to sing of the gory treatment Robin's penis could withstand, Robin gracefully orders them silent. They immediately encounter a three-headed giant (Terry Jones, Graham Chapman, and Michael Palin). The giant interrogates Robin, who wishes to discreetly downplay his significance, but his minstrel sings of Robin's identity and credentials. One of the heads wishes to cut Robin's head off, but the heads immediately descend into bickering about each others' lifestyles and various things completely unrelated to Robin. When they finally agree on their next course of action, they see that Robin is no longer available. Sir Robin has continued on the quest, and his minstrel sings a song that absurdly describes his lord's brave cowardice, over Robin's objections.Galahad, wet, weary, and probably depleted of much of his short-term vitality, follows a Grail-shaped light to Castle Anthrax. There he finds a colony of robe-clad teens, who will not hear of any talk about a Grail, but insist on tending to what they perceive to be Galahad's immediate needs&mdash;they decide that they are medical. Galahad is shy, and finds the strength to resist temptation, and again demands to see the Grail. At this point a girl named Dingo (Carol Cleveland) realizes that one of their rules has been broken, for which Galahad must administer the punishment. Dingo describes the punishment, which expands to include more and more inhabitants of the castle, and becomes increasingly sexual. Galahad finally seems willing to accept their hospitality, but then his friends storm the castle and rescue him. As he is being rescued he insists on remaining to fight the perils alone, but they valiantly stand by him, thinking only of his safety. The heroes leave a castle full of very frustrated girls (Elspeth Cameron, Mitsuko Forstater, and Sandy Rose).In the famous ""Scene 24,"" Arthur and Sir Bedevere are in a hut trying to extract information about the Grail from a frighteningly withered old man (Terry Gilliam), who can only cackle insanely to Arthur's questions. A fire burns in the middle of the room. Eventually the miscreation speaks, but does not answer Arthur's questions directly. He does speak of an enchanter and the Bridge of Death. The old man disappears, as does the hut&mdash;along with any indication of civilization, save the fire.Arthur's party progresses through a foggy forest to the accompaniment of stressful music, while Arthur makes anxious glances to the left and the right. The stress is brought to its natural end when they find themselves before a knight (Michael Palin) who's approximately twice the height of Arthur. He is surrounded by several other armoured men who lumber about like animals. They are the Knights who say ""Ni!"" They do indeed say ""Ni!"" as a form of intimidation and coercion, and liberally use it on Arthur at the slightest provocation, and also dread using the word ""it."" They demand a shrubbery from Arthur on pain of death.Meanwhile, a group of modern-day police officers conduct an investigation of the murder of the famous historian, and interview a woman (Rita Davies) who was close to him.The King of Swamp Castle (Michael Palin) brags (in a Yorkshire accent) about how he managed to build a castle on the worst possible terrain he could find, and brashly admits that the first few attempts were complete failures. He then explains to his son, Prince Herbert (Terry Jones), that the acquisition of more land is essential to their kingdom, which is why he must marry a princess who is connected to a great deal of it. Herbert has a horribly pale complexion, and is so effeminate that his own father mistakes him for someone called Alice.Herbert is reluctant to participate in this land-grab, and wishes to express himself in song, but the king shouts down the erupting music and forbids Herbert to sing. The king impatiently closes the discussion and storms off. As he prepares to leave the room, he orders two guards to watch Herbert. Unfortunately, the guard with speaking parts (Eric Idle) has a very hard time processing the phrase ""stay here and make sure he doesn't leave."" When the king finally leaves, melancholy music erupts, and the king returns to repeat his prohibition on singing. Herbert then tries to inconspicuously write a note, tie it to an arrow and shoot it through a window to the outside. The guards see what he is doing, but appear oblivious to the ramifications. Sir Lancelot discovers the note when the arrow it is tied to buries itself in the chest of his servant, Concorde (Eric Idle). The message is from someone pleading to be rescued from a forced marriage. Lancelot enthusiastically assumes that this is part of his quest for the Grail, and resolves to rescue what he thinks is a maiden.He charges into the castle and attacks several members of a wedding party, including the father of the bride and as many unarmed guards as he can. When he takes too many seconds between killing people, he attacks a wall-hanging. He bursts into Herbert's room, and then kills the guards while one of them tries to recall the instructions his king gave him, and how they might relate to the newcomer. The king appears and expresses his displeasure at the disruption that Lancelot has caused. However, when he learns that Lancelot is from Camelot, he appears to believe that Lancelot can provide some unspecified gain in lieu of Herbert.After severing the linens that Herbert is currently using to make his escape down the castle walls, the king escorts Lancelot out of the room, while making friendly conversation. The king tries to introduce Lancelot to the crowd, but their predictable hostility excites Lancelot into combat once again, and he kills a few more people before the king can calm him down. The king explains the new arrangement involving the princess and her holdings, which somehow depends on the death of her father. When her father appears to be recovering from Lancelot's attack, he motions to one of his guards, who approaches the father of the bride. The king delivers a narrative of the princess's father succumbing to his wounds, and surely enough, he dies. Herbert then appears in the castle, apparently in good health, which irritates his father. His irritation escalates when Herbert begins to explain his ordeal in song. Concorde appears and suggests that Lancelot return to the quest. Lancelot insists on a melodramatic exit, and then swings across the room from a rope. Somehow the stunt fails, and he is left dangling above the centre of the room.While riding into yet another provincial village, Arthur meets the Old Crone (Bee Duffell). She is asked about a shrubbery, but appears terrified by the inquiry, and refuses to cooperate. With some reluctance about the optics of such a spectacle, Arthur and Bedevere coerce her with the word ""Ni!"" Fortunately, Roger the Shrubber (Eric Idle) boldly happens by, and both parties are satisfied.Arthur and Bedevere return to the dreaded Knights who say ""Ni!"" but find that their name has been changed (to something so complex and random it was probably ad libbed, and therefore cannot be repeated here). The Knights who (so recently) said ""Ni!"" charge Arthur with another useless errand and an impossible task. The eccentric Knights are defeated by Arthur's accidental discovery of a secret word which is their weakness. Robin and his musically sardonic minstrels then appear on the scene. They ride off together.In the modern world, the police continue their investigation of the historian's murder.Back in the Medieval world, the adventurers each overcome their perils and reunite to face a bleak and terrible winter (which they survive by eating Sir Robin's minstrels).The reunited party ventures further to find the enchanter named Tim (John Cleese). Tim the Enchanter appears as a Scots-talking middle-aged man but commands great powers of pyrokinesis, has a very long, grey-streaked beard, and on his head either wears ram's horns, or grows them there. He is also able to withstand long awkward silences, doing nothing to break them. Arthur and his party are in awe of Tim and his spectacular display of pyrotechnics, and find themselves flustered when asking him for help, as per the instructions of the Old Man from Scene 24. Tim promises to help with their next phase of intelligence gathering and beckons the party follow him. After one step, he abruptly turns around and speaks of a terrible monster. The longer he spends on the warning, the more foolish he appears. Arthur's fearful respect for the enchanter is diminishing.The company approaches a rock-encircled clearing beyond which is the mouth of a cave that breathes smoke. Skeletons litter the scene. The tension jumps when Tim sights the monster. When the knights realize that the monster is an average-looking rabbit, the tension immediately turns to annoyance and scorn. Sir Bors (Terry Gilliam), ordered to dispatch the creature, sets forth to perform the task as casually as a short-order cook would perform his craft. The rabbit leaps about six feet to bite off Sir Bors's head before the knight even raises his sword. Tim feels vindicated and expresses it as would an 11-year-old. Arthur, believing a full scale attack is sufficient to accomplish the task, orders one. When several knights die in the attempt, he orders a retreat (in his own unique way).Tim regards the carnage with scorn of his own&mdash;wild chortling. When someone recalls the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, Arthur calls to Brother Maynard (Eric Idle), who is seen with his entourage a stone's-throw away, but off-camera until this scene. They consult with his order's exhaustive canon on use of the weapon, the Book of Arnaments, verses 9-21, describing how to use the grenade (""And Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying, 'O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade, that with it thou mayst blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.' And the Lord did grin. And the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths, and carp and anchovies, and orangutans and breakfast cereals, and fruit-bats and large chu&mdash;[Cleric is told to skip forward by Brother Maynard]&mdash;And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less.Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.') After a miscount, the grenade is thrown at the rabbit, and a thundering explosion alerts the police, who are already looking for a murderer.In the cave beyond the rabbit, Aramaic writing is found, which Brother Maynard translates. Finally, they receive concrete instructions on where to find the Grail: the ""Castle of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh"". While they are trying to deduce the meaning of the text, the knights are ambushed by the Legendary (Animated) Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh. The human party (also animated) are chased about the cave, and are only saved when the animator (Terry Gilliam) suffers a fatal heart attack.In the modern world, the police discover the gruesome scene at the cave entrance. They assume it's a homicide, and not an animal attack.Arthur's party approaches the Bridge of Death that is guarded by the Old Man from Scene 24. Arthur orders Sir Robin to face the deadly quiz that the Old Man will give him, but Robin deflects the order. Lancelot makes the first attempt, and when the party sees that the challenge is as difficult as answering a few superficial personal questions, Robin finds his bravery renewed, and volunteers to be the next participant. Unfortunately, the last question asked Robin involves geographical trivia that would have been very rare knowledge in the Dark Ages, and Robin is thrown into the Pit of Death. Then Galahad flubs his answer and is also lost. When Arthur is asked a question about aerodynamics (involving the redundant ""airspeed velocity""), he solves the problem by answering it with a specific question (which the Bridgekeeper cannot answer). The Old Man is cast into the pit, and the way is clear.Arthur and Bedevere search for Lancelot, but he is not to be found. In fact, he has his hands pressed against a police car and is being searched. The king and his remaining free knight are called by an ethereal song. They are drawn over misty mountains to a lake. To a majestic, brass-rich soundtrack, a barge with the head of a monster transports our heroes across the water to the island of the Castle Aaarrghh.As the music reaches crescendo, the men disembark and kneel. Arthur, mounting his sword tip on the ground, offers the Lord a solemn prayer. The music is interrupted by the sound of a catapult being discharged. Arthur's speech switches from prayer to blasphemy as a sheep lands on them. The Taunting Frenchman appears atop the castle wall and offers his usual insolence. Arthur launches into orders, threats, and expressions of indignation invoking God's name. The French respond with human waste. Humiliated and soiled, Arthur and Bedevere walk back through the water to the mainland as the French taunt at will.Reaching the other side of the lake, Arthur shouts to an unseen party to stand ready. To the sound of a military drum, emerging on a nearby ridge, soldiers numbering maybe 1,000 form a line of battle nearly as many feet in width. They are well equipped. Arthur shouts a deadly oath across the lake to the French who persist in their taunts. Without hesitation, Arthur orders a charge, and the company surges forward.As the soldiers approach the shore on the mainland, they are cut off by just two modern-day police cars. The line of battle has shrunk to less than 100 feet, and Arthur and Bedevere are arrested. At least three of the officers start pushing back the crowd and confiscate an ""offensive weapon.""

tt0071877,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery']","The murderHaving sorted a matter out in the Middle East, detective Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney) is returning to England aboard the Orient Express. During the journey, Poirot encounters his friend Bianchi (Martin Balsam), a director of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, which owns the line. The train is unusually crowded for the time of year: every first-class berth has been booked. Shortly after the train's departure from Istanbul, a wealthy American businessman, Ratchett (Richard Widmark), tries to secure Poirot's services for $15,000 since he has received many death threats, but Poirot finds the case of little interest and turns it down. That night the train is caught in heavy snows in the Balkans. The next morning Ratchett is found stabbed to death in his cabin.
Poirot and Bianchi work together to solve the case. They enlist the help of Dr. Constantine (George Coulouris), a Greek medical doctor who was travelling in another coach with Bianchi as the only other passenger and thus not a suspect. Pierre Michel (Jean-Pierre Cassel), the middle-aged French conductor of the car, also assists the investigation, as well as being a suspect. Poirot soon discovers that Ratchett was not who he claimed to be. The victim's secret past indicates a clear motive for murder, even justification, but who was the killer?
CluesDr. Constantine's examination of the body reveals that Ratchett was stabbed 12 times. Some wounds were slight, but at least three of them could have resulted in death.
The stopped watch in the victim's pocket, as well as Poirot's reconstructed timeline of passenger activities the night before, indicate that Ratchett was murdered at about 1:15 a.m. The train had stopped, surrounded by fresh snow, before that time. There are no tracks in the snow and the doors to the other cars were locked, so the murderer is almost certainly still among the passengers in the coach in which Ratchett was killed.
Most importantly, Poirot realizes that Ratchett was in fact a gangster called Cassetti. Five years previously, Cassetti and a henchman kidnapped and murdered Daisy Armstrong, the baby daughter of a wealthy British Army Colonel who had settled in America with his American-born wife. The body was found after the ransom had been paid. Overcome with grief, the pregnant Mrs. Armstrong went into labor early and died while giving birth to a stillborn baby. A maidservant named Paulette who was wrongly suspected of complicity in the kidnapping committed suicide. Colonel Armstrong, consumed by these tragedies, later killed himself as well. Cassetti's accomplice was arrested and executed, but Cassetti himself fled the country with the ransom, as he was only revealed to be the leader on the eve of the execution.
Having established these facts, Poirot, Dr. Constantine and Bianchi summon the other passengers one by one and proceed to interrogate them.
(The fictitious Armstrong case was inspired by the real-life kidnapping of aviator Charles Lindbergh's child.)
SuspectsThe thirteen suspects are:
Hector McQueen (Anthony Perkins), a tall, young American man, the victim's secretary and translator;
Edward Beddoes (Sir John Gielgud), the victim's British valet;
Mary Debenham (Vanessa Redgrave), a young British woman, returning home to England after working as a teacher in Baghdad;
Colonel Arbuthnott (Sean Connery), a British officer in the British Indian Army returning to England on leave;
Princess Natalia Dragomiroff (Wendy Hiller), an elderly Russian royal;
Hildegarde Schmidt (Rachel Roberts), a middle-aged German woman, the Princess' personal maid;
Count Rudolf Andrenyi (Michael York), an aristocratic Hungarian diplomat;
Countess Elena Andrenyi (Jacqueline Bisset), née Grünwald, his beautiful young wife;
Greta Ohlsson (Ingrid Bergman), a middle-aged Swedish missionary returning to Europe on a fund-raising trip for her mission in Africa;
Mrs. Harriet Belinda Hubbard (Lauren Bacall), an older, fussy, very talkative American pluri-widowed socialite;
Antonio (Gino) Foscarelli (Denis Quilley), an exuberant Italian American car salesman from Chicago;
Cyrus B. ""Dick"" Hardman (Colin Blakely), a Pinkerton's detective masquerading as a talent agent;
Pierre-Paul Michel (Jean-Pierre Cassel), the French conductor of the sleeping car.
MotivePoirot soon comes to realise that all the suspects were connected to the Armstrong family and had reason to seek revenge for the tragedies that followed the kidnapping. Some openly admit their connections to the Armstrongs, while other ties must be uncovered by Poirot.
McQueen was the son of the District Attorney who prosecuted the case and was very fond of Mrs. Armstrong;
Miss Debenham was Mrs Armstrong's secretary;
Beddoes was Colonel Armstrong's army batman and the family butler;
Col. Arbuthnott was an army friend of Col. Armstrong;
Princess Dragomiroff was Sonia Armstrong's godmother;
Miss Schmidt was the Armstrongs' cook;
Miss Ohlsson was Daisy's nursemaid;
Foscarelli was the Armstrong's chauffeur;
Hardman was, at the time, a policeman who was in love with Paulette;
Michel was Paulette's father;
Countess Andrenyi was Mrs Armstrong's sister;
Mrs Hubbard was Mrs Armstrong's mother;
Count Andrenyi was Mrs Armstrong's brother in law.
Ratchett was sedated by Beddoes and McQueen. Each of the passengers then stabbed him in turn.
Poirot presents this explanation for the murder to the assembled passengers, describing it as the ""complex"" solution to the crime. Yet he also offers another explanation, a ""simple"" one. In the course of the inquiry evidence has been found of an intruder on the train, who may have murdered Ratchett and then escaped evidence planted by the suspects. Poirot suggests that Ratchett/Cassetti may have been involved with the Mafia and murdered as the result of a feud. He leaves it to Bianchi, director of the line, to decide which explanation to present to the local police.
Bianchi decides that this ""simple"" solution will be enough for the local police and that Ratchett deserved everything he got. A cover-up is therefore instigated. Poirot is satisfied that justice has been done, though he does admit to a struggle with his conscience."
tt0071910,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'R']","During World War II, Maximilian Theo Aldorfer (Dirk Bogarde), a former Nazi SS officer who had posed as a doctor to take sensational photographs in concentration camps, and Lucia Atherton (Charlotte Rampling), a Holocaust survivor, had an ambiguous sadomasochistic relationship. Flashbacks show Max tormenting Lucia, but also acting as her protector.In present day 1957, Lucia, now married to an American orchestra conductor, meets Max again by chance. He is now a night porter at a hotel in Vienna, Austria and a reluctant member of a group of former SS comrades who have been carefully covering up their pasts by destroying documents and eliminating witnesses to their wartime activities. Max has an upcoming mock trial at the hands of the group for his war crimes. The group's leader, Hans Folger (Gabriele Ferzetti), accuses Max of wanting to live 'hidden away like a church mouse'. Max wishes to remain hidden, but he voices support for the group's activities. Memories of the past punctuate Max and Lucia's present with urgent frequency, suggesting that Lucia survived through her relationship with Max. In one such flashback, Lucia sings a Marlene Dietrich song, ""Wenn ich mir was wünschen dürfte"" (""If I could make a wish""), to the camp guards while wearing pieces of an SS uniform, and Max 'rewards' her with the severed head of a male inmate who had been bullying her, a reference to Salome.Because she could testify against him, Lucia's existence is a threat to Max. He goes to see a former Nazi collaborator, Mario (Ugo Cardea), who knows Lucia is still alive; Max murders him to protect his secret. After Lucia's husband leaves town on business, Max and Lucia renew their past lovemaking in Max's apartment. Max confesses to Countess Stein, another guest at his hotel, that he has found his ""little girl"" again. The Countess tells him that he is insane; Max replies that they are both 'in the same boat'. Meanwhile, Folger has Max spied on by a teenage bellboy who works at the hotel.Max is interviewed by the police about Mario's murder. He spends days with Lucia in his apartment, chaining her to the wall so that ""they can't take her away"" and sleeps little. Folger, who wants Lucia to testify against Max in the mock trial-though he harbors more ambiguous long-term intentions toward her-visits and informs her that Max is ill. He suggests that Lucia must also be ill to allow herself to be in this position, but Lucia sends him away, claiming to be with Max of her own free will.The SS officers are infuriated at Max for hiding a key witness. Max refuses to go through with the trial, calling it 'a farce', and admits that he works as a night porter due to his sense of shame in daytime. He returns to Lucia, telling her that the police questioned him and others at the hotel about her disappearance, and that no suspicion fell on him.Eventually, Max quits his job, devoting all of his time to Lucia. The SS officers cut off the couple's supply of food from a nearby grocery store. Max barricades the door to the apartment, and he and Lucia begin rationing. Max seeks help by phoning one of his old hotel friends, who refuses, and imploring his neighbor, but she is prevented from providing aid by Adolph, the youth who had spied on Max earlier. Max retreats again to the apartment, where Lucia is almost unconscious from malnutrition. After one of the SS cuts off the electricity in Max's apartment, Max and Lucia, respectively dressed in his Nazi uniform and a negligee resembling the one she had worn in the concentration camp, leave the building and drive away; they are soon followed by a car driven by Max's former colleagues. Max parks his car on a bridge, where he and Lucia walk along the sidewalk as dawn breaks. Two gunshots ring out, and the doomed lovers fall dead."
tt0071935,"['Drama', 'Thriller']","The movie opens in September 1963 with armored maneuvers in the Israeli desert. A top Israeli military leader confers with a Mossad agent, explaining that the Egyptians are massing 400 rockets in Helwan, arming the warheads with bubonic plague and radioactive Strontium 90. The missiles are targeted on Israeli cities, needing only an advanced guidance system to make them operational. The guidance system is being perfected somewhere in Germany under the sponsorship of ODESSA, an organization of former high-ranking SS officials. It is a race against time.The action switches to Hamburg, Germany in November of the same year. A young and ambitious freelance journalist named Peter Miller (Jon Voight) drives through the streets of Hamburg, which are festively decorated for the holidays. An announcement over Miller's car radio grabs his attention. President John F. Kennedy has been assassinated in Dallas. As Miller sadly listens to the news, emergency vehicles speed past. Miller follows them and stops at an old apartment building, where the upstairs windows have been flung open. A policeman friend explains to Miller that a lonely old man has gassed himself and there is no story to be had. Back home in bed with his dancer girlfriend Sigi (Mary Tamm), Miller muses that the first photographs of Kennedy's killer might fetch two million marks. Sigi scolds him as a parasite who profits from other people's misfortune.The next day, Miller meets his police officer friend for lunch and is loaned the diary that had been kept by the deceased old man, Salomon Tauber. The police officer coyly suggests that Miller might find the contents interesting. Miller takes the diary home and discovers that Tauber and his wife Esther were German Jews who had been inmates at the Riga concentration camp. Tauber's diary details the sadistic butchery of camp commandant Eduard Roschman (Maximilian Schell). Tauber's wife had been gassed, but he was determined to survive and be a witness against Nazi war crimes. The diary goes on to detail an incident that Tauber had witnessed on the Riga docks in October 1944. With the Russians rapidly advancing, the Germans were desperately evacuating thousands of wounded troops by ship. Eduard Roschman had suddenly appeared on the docks, seeking to commandeer a ship for his SS troops. He met determined resistance from a courageous Wehrmacht captain who knocked Roschman to the ground. Roschman shot the captain dead, and as he fell his rare Knights Cross bravery medal with Oak Leaf clusters had spilled into the snow.Miller is greatly upset by Tauber's sad tale, and he sets out to investigate further. Despite being discouraged by his girlfriend, his editor and his own mother (Maria Schell), Miller returns to Tauber's apartment building and bribes the hard-boiled manager into letting him see Tauber's meager possessions. The manager discloses that Tauber had only one friend, an old Jewish man named Marx. Miller tracks him down and learns that Tauber had only recently seen Roschman in Hamburg.Upon reporting it to the police, Tauber was completely ignored. He had come up against the ODESSA. Despairing that justice would never be done, Tauber killed himself.Following up on old Marx's revelation, Miller visits the State War Crimes office to look up Roschman's records. Hearing his inquiries, an officious bureaucrat (and ODESSA member) comes out to shoo Miller away, but Miller overhears a telephone conversation about the upcoming annual reunion of the bureaucrat's German army division. Miller determines to crash the party. He runs into trouble when he snaps a flash picture of a shadowy and mysterious speaker. He is thrown from the hall and returns home battered and bloody, his camera smashed.The following day, Miller accompanies Sigi on a Christmas shopping trip. While waiting on the subway platform, Miller is suddenly pushed off the platform into the path of an oncoming train, narrowly escaping with his life. Undeterred, Miller travels to Vienna to look up famed Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal. Miller's dogged persistence is starting to seriously alarm the leadership of ODESSA. Miller manages to secure an interview with Wiesenthal, who enlightens him about ODESSA and its mission to protect Nazi war criminals and their activities. Wiesenthal informs Miller that ODESSA provides SS criminals with forged identities. If Miller wants to find Roschman, he needs to find the forger who created his identity papers.Back at his hotel, Miller is approached by an ODESSA emissary who tries to claim Roschman is long dead. When that story falls flat, the man warns Miller to drop his pursuit of Roschman, but Miller angrily refuses. At a highway rest stop, Miller is abducted by a group of men, but they turn out to be Israeli intelligence agents, not ODESSA. They know about his pursuit of Roschman, but they are skeptical about who he is working for. Once they are convinced of his intentions, the Israelis convince Miller to work with them in penetrating ODESSA. The Israelis capitalize on their local intelligence assets to create an alternate identity for Miller, using the name Rolf Gunter Kolb, a former SS man who has just expired from a stomach tumor.Meanwhile, back in Hamburg, ODESSA has assigned an assassin to kill Miller, but they haven't been able to find him since his ""disappearance"" near Vienna. One evening as Sigi is leaving the nightclub, she is chased down in the Elbe tunnel by the hired killer. He demands to know Miller's whereabouts. Just in the nick of time, a passing car interrupts the attack. Sigi flags down the auto, conveniently driven by an ODESSA member of the police department. The policeman pressures Sigi to take in a ""police woman"" who will ensure her safety.The Israelis place Miller in the hands of an expert who rigorously indoctrinates him in the rituals, slogans and beliefs of the SS. Miller's underarm is even disfigured with a red-hot iron bar to conceal the SS blood group tattoo that would have been there. Once he is deemed ready, Miller (posing as Kolb) is sent to contact a known ODESSA member, using the cover story that he was recognized by a Jewish hospital orderly who had been held at Flossenburg concentration camp, where Kolb had served. Kolb is supposedly on the run, looking for refuge with his former comrades.After passing a thorough screening, Miller is sent on to the organization's document forger in Bayreuth. After being dropped off at the Munich train station, Miller calls Sigi in Hamburg and is surprised to hear the police woman answer the phone. The police woman reports the call to her ODESSA employers and they realize that Miller has fooled them. Their assassin is dispatched to intercept Miller when he arrives in Bayreuth.Miller arrives at the forger's shop first, where proprietor Klaus Wenzer (Derek Jacobi) explains that passport photos are required, and the photographer won't arrive until Monday. Miller is sent to a nearby hotel to pass the time. Later that night, the hit man arrives at the shop and instructs Wenzer to contact Miller and tell him the photographer has arrived early. Miller is summoned but approaches the shop warily. He spots the hit man's sleek XKE sports car concealed nearby. Peering through a window, Miller sees the killer waiting in the shop. Miller climbs through an upstairs window and encounters Wenzer's invalid and senile mother, who mistakes Miller's dark clothing for that of a priest. She confides her worries about her son and his dangerous work, and how the ODESSA had killed her husband when he was no longer useful. She tells Miller about a secret file that her son has kept in the safe as insurance against the same fate, detailing the false identities and current photographs of all the ODESSA men he has worked with. She discloses that the safe combination is the same as the shop phone number. Miller sneaks up on the assassin and kills him after a desperate fight. Opening the safe, Miller discovers the incriminating ODESSA file, including the new identity and current image of Eduard Roschman. He takes the gunman's weapon and car and heads for Munich, where he deposits the file in a train station locker for safekeeping.Miller contacts Sigi and tells her to meet him in Heidelberg, but not to tell anyone where she is going. Sigi manages to lock the police woman in her room and flee. After a brief reunion, Miller tells Sigi about the ODESSA file and gives her the key to the locker. He instructs her that in the event he fails to return, she is to retrieve the file and deliver it to Simon Wiesenthal in Vienna. Miller then leaves in search of Roschman.Roschman's new identity is that of Hans Josef Kiefel, the wealthy owner of a large electrical concern. Miller attends the opening of a trade fair at Kiefel Electric and spots the notorious SS butcher. Miller follows him to his secluded castle on a wooded estate, where Roschman is protected by the local police. Miller carefully gains entrance to the castle through a basement door and confronts Roschman at gunpoint in his study. Roschman tries to buy time, alternately trying to deny the grisly truth and defend the Nazi cause, thinking Miller is just a misguided young idealist. But then Miller produces the photo of the handsome Wehrmacht captain Roschman had shot on the Riga docks so long ago, asking Roschman if he remembers the incident. Roschman dismissively owns up to the crime before Miller reveals that the captain was his father.Roschman is stunned, now understanding that he is dealing with something entirely different than he had thought. Roschman takes advantage of Miller's distracted agitation and works his way over to his desk, pulling out a pistol. He fires at Miller before Miller manages to gun him down.It is subsequently revealed that Miller was held for only three weeks and then released. As instructed, Sigi had delivered the ODESSA file to Wiesenthal, resulting in great embarrassment for the West German government and the arrest of many Nazi war criminals. The research facilities of Kiefel Electric, where the missile guidance systems were being developed, mysteriously burned to the ground. The rockets of Helwan never flew."
tt0071970,"['Drama', 'Thriller']","Seattle, WashingtonSenator Charles Carroll (William ""Bill"" Boyce), an independent senator, is holding a luncheon atop the Seattle Space Needle. Joe Frady (Warren Beatty), an alcoholic journalist, tries to gain entry to the luncheon, but is turned away. At the restaurant atop the Space Needle, Senator Carroll is holding a press conference when he is suddenly shot to death by an unseen assassin. Everyone looks around and sees a waiter holding a gun, and he is jumped by security guards. However, a second waiter (Bill McKinney), who also has a gun (and the real or second shooter) leaves unnoticed. The first waiter replies that he didn't do it, and he is chased over the roof of the building by guards, where he accidentally slips and falls off the roof to his death. The real assassin chuckles as he leaves the scene and reports to an unseen contact that the job is finished. Four months later, a seven-man commission holds a special public gathering and they conclude that the waiter, named Thomas Richard Lindern (Chuck Waters), acted alone and that there is no greater conspiracy to the assassination of Senator Carroll.Three years laterJoe Frady, writing for a Portland, Oregon newspaper, sets himself up to get arrested to get a story on a major drug bust. Frady is bailed out of jail by his boss and editor Bill Rintels (Hume Cronyn) who always complains that Frady is trying to create news rather than reporting it. Shortly thereafter, Frady is visited by Lee Carter (Paula Prentiss), a Seattle newscaster and his former girlfriend, who tells them that she fears for her life. Lee tells Frady that someone is trying to kill her and that six other reporters at the luncheon have all died mysteriously during the past two years. Frady shrugs her off by telling her that she's just being paranoid. But a few days later, Lee is found dead in her apartment. Frady investigates and the coroner tells him that she apparently killed herself with an overdose of sleeping pills, but Frady knows different.Frady tells Rintels that there is a story brewing here about the events behind the Senator Carroll assassination, and Rintels reluctantly agrees to let Frady pursue his story. Frady meets with a former FBI agent (Kenneth Mars) who informs him that they are many methods that can be used to make someone's death look like an accident or suicide such as certain drugs which are fatal, but show up that a person's heart failed on them.Frady travels to a small fishing village in upstate Washington where one of the witnesses to Carroll's assassination died. At the local bar, a rough deputy, named Red (Earl Hindman), tries to beat up Frady, but after a long and vicious fistfight, Frady wins, knocking out Deputy Red. The sheriff, L.D. Wicker (Kelly Thorsden), appears and applauds Frady for standing up to his loathsome deputy and he is rather friendly towards him. Frady asks the sheriff for information about the dead person, claiming to be an old friend.Sheriff L.D. takes Frady to the spot where the Carroll witness died: a small creek right in front of a large dam. The sheriff explains that the man, Alan Bridges, was fishing when a dam sluice had opened up, releasing tons of water to relieve pressure on the dam as it does every few days and that that Bridges was washed away and drowned. Just then, a siren announces that the dam sluice is opening again. Suddenly, the sheriff pulls a gun on Frady. clearly intending to kill him in the same way he killed Mr. Bridges. Frady throws his fishing rod at the sheriff and tackles him where they both fall into the water. Frady and the sheriff struggle as they are swept away by the wall of water that hits both of them. Frady grabs a shore rock and makes it ashore while the sheriff is swept away and drowns.Taking Sheriff L.D.'s car, Frady goes to the sheriff's apartment to search it for evidence and finds test applications to the Parallax Corporation. Just then, Deputy Red arrives at the apartment looking for the sheriff and Frady runs. After a long and wild car case, Frady escapes from the deputy.Returning to Portland, Frady tells Rintels what happened and shows him the copies of the Parallax Corporation application tests, and that there's something big going on. But Rintels refuses to believe Frady is onto something. Frady takes the test application to a psychology lab where the attending psychoanalyst believes that the tests are for measuring one's mental state and ability to commit crimes. Frady allows a lab worker, and a former prison convict who served time for murder, to take the test. Using the alias of ""Richard Paley"", Frady submits the finished test result to Parallax.A few days later, Frady meets with Austin Tucker (William Daniels), a former Carroll aide, who has arrived in the country and claims that people are trying to kill him for Senator Carroll had many enemies from his past for his liberal views and work. Tucker and his aide/bodyguard take Frady out on a sailboat where he confides in Frady that there is indeed a wide conspiracy in the Carroll assassination and that Thomas Richard Lindern did not act alone and that a powerful corporation may have covered it up. Tucker shows photos that were taken of the luncheon on that day, and points to the second waiter in one of the photographs and asks Frady if he knows the man. Frady doesn't and asks why. Tucker tells Frady that it's probably nothing, but Tucker also explains that he cannot shake the feeling that the second waiter looks familiar. A few minutes later, the boat explodes from a bomb hidden in the cabin. Frady sitting on the bow of the boat jumps overboard, while Tucker and his aide, catching the full blast, are killed.Frady meets with Rintels and tells him about what happened and Rintels agrees to help Frady with his story. Using his alias, Frady checks himself into a fleabag motel in downtown Los Angeles, and a few days later a certain 'Jack Younger' (Walter McGinn), claiming to be a representative of the Parallax Corporation, contacts Frady in his room and says that his aggressiveness (as shown on the test answers) makes him valuable for certain corporations. Younger asks Frady/Richard Paley to join the corporation for the 'special projects' division.Frady goes to the Parallax offices in downtown L.A. and meets with Mr. Younger who shows him a special room where Frady is 'tested' with a series of brainwashing techniques with him being shown various photos and images of death and destruction as if to make him suitable for indoctrination. Frady becomes aware that this branch of the Parallax is a training ground for assassins.As Frady is leaving the building for the day when his 'tests' are finished, he spots the second waiter from the Tucker photo talking to some businessmen. Frady follows the second waiter/assassin outside to his car and tails him driving around the city. The assassin switches cars with another person, and obtains a briefcase which he takes to the local airport.The assassin checks himself on a plane to Chicago, and Frady checks himself on the same plane. The plane takes off, but the assassin does not board for he has apparently checked in his briefcase which has a bomb in it. On the plane, Frady sees that that assassin is nowhere to be found, and after seeing that a prominent senator on board, realizes that the plane must have a bomb on board. After trying to sneak a message on a restroom mirror, Frady anonymously passes a note on a napkin to a stewardess that a bomb is on board. The stewardess relays the news to the pilot who immediately returns the plane to Los Angeles. After everyone has disembarked, the plane explodes.Frady returns to his seedy motel room to find Mr. Younger waiting for him and he informs Frady that Parallax have already had an offer of employment for Frady, but he immediately expresses suspicion as a background check made by Parallax on Frady showed that some of his references were false. Frady then makes up a new alias for Younger explaining that he's an alcoholic and lied on his background to land a job. Younger offers to look into it and again promises Frady that Parallax is a great opportunity for people like him, and then leaves.Realizing that it will only be a matter of time before they discover his real identity, Frady secretly mails the Parallax test papers and an audiotape he made on a mini-tape recorder of his conversation with Younger to Rintels. Along with it is a note from Frady who explains that he may be in way over his head and that if anything were to happen to him, that Rintels should publish this information about Parallax and what they do on the sidelines of recruiting assassins to kill prominent officials who threaten or get too close to the corporation's nefarious plans. Rintels listens to the tape and finally realizes that Frady is onto something big. Rintels, who practically lives in his office and orders take-out food every day from a deli across the street, orders more food as he reviews more of the papers Frady has mailed to him. Just then, the deli delivery guy arrives with Rintels' latest food order. The delivery guy is the Parallax assassin in disguise. The next morning, Rintels is found dead by his employees in his office, dead from an apparent ""heart attack"" after he was poisoned. The evidence is gone and the audio tape has been erased.In Los Angeles, Frady, unaware of Rintels' murder and that he is now on his own, gets his first assignment to meet with his new co-worker at a local hotel for their ""assignments"". Frady sneaks out of the planned meeting place and goes to Parallax's offices asking to meet with Mr. Younger, but is told that Younger is out. Frady spots the Parallax assassin and follows him into the hallways of the L.A. Convention Center. Mr. Younger is there with more Parallax businessmen/assassins where they are talking about their latest plans. Frady watches them from a distance as Mr. Younger leaves and the Parallax assassin and a few others go to the platforms above the floor of the convention hall.Frady sees that down below a dress rehearsal where Senator George Hammond (Jim Davis), a prominent California senator, is rehearsing a speech he will give that night. Frady believes that the assassin is going to shoot the senator with a rifle that he loads and lies down on the walkway above the convention hall. Then, just as Senator Hammond is planning to leave before he makes his appearance, the assassin suddenly leaves, leaving Frady in hiding on the walkway, alone and locked in the area. Suddenly, shots ring out as one of the assassins shoots and kills Hammond with a second rifle from a concealed location, just as Hammond is riding in a golf cart out of the convention hall. Everyone looks up and around for the shooter, and sees Frady.... standing on the plank way above them near the unused rifle. THEY THINK HE DID IT!!!! Frady realizes (way too late) that he's been set up! Frady hides under the plank way as three Parallax security guards/assassins show up looking for him. When police sirens are heard, the three assassins flee, leaving the door to the exit wide open. After a few minutes, Frady tries to run for the exit, when the assassin appears as a menacing silhouette in the doorway (anticipating that Frady would do just that) and guns him down, and thus announces that they got the shooter.Several months later, a second seven-man congressional commission is held where the lead commissioner reports that Frady had blamed Senator Hammond for the Senator Carroll assassination and had sought revenge. (Note: it is never explained if any of both the seven-man commissions are in league with Parallax, or if they are only easily duped into believing the fabricated evidence.) The commission rules that there is no evidence of a conspiracy in the killing of Senator Hammond. Frady was the lone assassin. Case closed. The commission does not take questions from the unseen press."

Swan is deeply moved by Winslow's song and deemed Winslow's music as the perfect music to open ""The Paradise"", Swan's highly anticipated new concert hall. Swan sends his loyal right-hand man Arnold Philbin (George Memmoli) to steal Winslow's song and claim it as his own. When Winslow arrives at Death Records, Swan's record label, he is thrown out.Winslow sneaks into Swan's private mansion, ""The Swanage"", to find out what's going on, he observes several women all rehearsing his music for an audition. One of them is an aspiring singer, Phoenix (Jessica Harper), whom Winslow deems perfect for his music and the two quickly fall for each other. Winslow is told of Swan's plan to open the Paradise with Winslow's music. When Winslow sneaks in once more, Swan orders he be thrown out again and for his minions to beat up Winslow and frame him for drug dealing. Winslow is given a life sentence (from more of Swan's manipulation of the legal system) and is sent to Sing Sing Prison. Winslow's teeth are extracted and now replaced with shiny metal ones as part of an experimental prisoner program funded by the Swan Foundation.Six months later, Winslow hears on the radio, while assembling tiddlywinks games in the prison rehab center, that The Juicy Fruits, whom he hates, have made an anticipated hit record of his music with Swan's backing. Winslow goes berserk, punches out a guard and escapes from prison in a delivery box driven off prison property. He breaks into the Death Records building and tears the place up. He then breaks into Swan's record factory where he sets out to destroy a record press. When a guard catches him fiddling with the record press, Winslow slips and the record press catches his sleeve, tumbling him head first into the record press which crushes and burns his face and destroys his vocal cords. Bleeding profusely and with his face now severely mutilated, a disoriented Winslow makes his way to the edge of the East River and tumbles into the water. The newspaper reports the details of the night and that his body was not recovered.Sneaking into the Paradise, Winslow makes his way into the costume department where he dons a black leather costume, a long black cape (though he also wears a red one later in the movie) and a silver owl-like mask to cover his now deformed face, becoming the Phantom of the Paradise so he can terrorize Swan and his musicians. In a musical split-screen sequence, Winslow plants a time bomb on a prop convertible during a musical act and nearly kills The Beach Bums (formerly The Juicy Fruits, who have traded doo-wop for surf music). Seeing the Phantom on a security camera, Swan realizes there is an intruder about.The Phantom confronts Swan, who recognizes him as Winslow and offers the composer the chance to have his music produced his way. Auditions are held and the Phantom selects Phoenix for the lead. Later, in a secluded recording studio in the basement of the building, Swan provides the Phantom with an electronic voice-box, enabling him to speak and sing (with the voice of Paul Williams). Swan orders the Phantom to stop terrorizing the Paradise and rewrite his cantata for Phoenix. The Phantom reluctantly agrees on the condition that Phoenix is the lead singer and that Swan plays ""what I write!"" Swan promises and the Phantom signs a contract in blood.Swan is later shown bitterly listening to the recording session with Winslow: while he sounded normal at the time, the tapes mysterious play back Swan's voice as ragged, wicked and monstrous-sounding. While the Phantom remains in the recording studio rewriting his cantata, Swan breaks the deal by telling Philbin that he resents Phoenix's perfection for the lead role: ""You know how I abhor perfection in anyone but myself."" Swan replaces Phoenix with pill-popping, male glam-rock prima donna Beef (Gerrit Graham) in the lead of Winslow's Faust and moves Phoenix for the role of backup singer. Beef is revealed to the media at a press conference where all cameras and recording devices are strictly banned, as per Swan's policy.After days of isolation, the Phantom completes Faust, Swan having gotten him hooked on uppers in the process. Swan steals the completed cantata while ordering his minions to seal up the Phantom inside the recording studio with a brick wall. However, when the Phantom awakens that night and realizes he has been betrayed again, he manages to escape with deadly fury and kills Swan's guards. The Phantom then confronts Beef (in a comic allusion to the infamous shower scene in Psycho (1960)) and threatens to kill him if he performs. Beef tries to flee, but is stopped by Philbin outside the building, who suggests to Beef that this was all a drug-induced hallucination.Onstage, the glam-rock band The Undeads (the former Juicy Fruits/the Beach Bums), costumed to resemble the somnambulist from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), perform of the ultimate man, appearing to dismember audience members (actually planted actors with dummy limbs) and making a show of appearing to turn the parts into Beef, now costumed as a glitter-clad Frankenstein's monster. As Beef performs a completely rewritten glam-rock version of Winslow's song ""Old Souls"", hidden in the rafters, the Phantom strikes and electrocutes Beef with a lightning-bolt-shaped neon sign (to the great delight of the crowd).Horrified, Philbin orders Phoenix onstage as a replacement. Singing the slow true version of Winslow's music at last, Phoenix is an immediate sensation with the audience. As they continue to cheer for Beef outside as his dead body is loaded into an ambulance, Swan now realizes the potential of the situation. In Phoenix's dressing room, Swan arrives and seduces Phoenix after the show with promises of her future stardom. As she leaves, she is nearly overwhelmed by the zealous crowd, but is quickly spirited away by the Phantom. On the roof, the Phantom tells Phoenix his true identity and what Swan has done. He implores Phoenix to leave the Paradise so Swan won't destroy her like he has destroyed everything else. Fearing the Phantom, Phoenix does not believe him and escapes.At the Swanage, the Phantom secretly observes Swan and Phoenix locked in a tight embrace. Heartbroken, he commits suicide by stabbing himself through the heart with his Bowie knife. However, the Phantom awakens from death and sees Swan standing over him. Pulling the knife out, Swan tells the Phantom that he cannot die because he's locked to the blood contract he had signed earlier: The Phantom cannot die until Swan himself has died. With that knowledge, the Phantom attempts to stab Swan through the heart, but Swan is unharmed and merely pulls the knife away. Looking down at the Phantom, Swan hisses in an almost reptilian voice, ""I'm under contract, too!""Rolling Stone announces the upcoming wedding between Swan and Phoenix during Faust's finale. While everyone prepares, the Phantom sneaks into Swan's private taping room to watch the tape containing the blood contract. Watching the tape, the Phantom then learns that Swan made a pact with the devil over 20 years ago (1953): Swan will remain youthful forever unless the videotaped recording of his contract is destroyed. Future photos, videos and recordings of Swan will age and fester in his place, explaining why he abhors being caught on film. The tape goes on to reveal footage of Winslow signing his contract with Swan and finally a new one Swan made with Phoenix when she was stoned, promising him ""her voice"" upon her death (presumably to finally overcome Swan's voice's wretched sound when recorded, as per his own contract). On a live television camera, the Phantom observes an assassin assembling a rifle and realizes Swan is planning to have Phoenix assassinated during the ceremony. The Phantom destroys most of the recordings by setting them on fire and heads off to the wedding between Swan and Phoenix.The wedding is in full swing onstage, with Philbin officiating and Swan wearing gloves and a silver mask of his own face to prevent being properly filmed. The Phantom manages to throw off the assassin's aim to stop him from hitting Phoenix, causing him to shoot and kill Philbin instead. With the tapes destroyed and Swan now mortal once again, the Phantom swings down onto the stage and rips off Swan's mask, finally exposing him as a monster on live television. Swan's face is now hideous, burning away like the tapes and contracts. Realizing what's happening, a crazed Swan gropes for Phoenix's throat, demanding she give him her voice, beginning to strangle her. The Phantom intervenes and stabs Swan repeatedly in the chest with the metal beak of a backup dancer's bird-shaped headpiece. The moment he does, his own fatal chest wound reopens.As he is dying, Swan is carried around by the audience, who are driven to the point of hysteria and join in stabbing him. The dying Winslow also removes his mask to reveal his own face, and cheered on by the crowd, crawls on the floor towards the shocked Phoenix. Just as he holds out a hand to her, Swan dies, allowing Winslow to die of his own wound. As Winslow succumbs, Phoenix finally recognizes him as the kind man she met in line at the Swanage. Phoenix rushes over and lies down next to him, crying and heartbroken as the audience raves.The closing credits feature a series of montages of the cast members, identifying each by name, commencing with the musical trio and concluding with Winslow/The Phantom. Most of the shots in these montages are from the movie, but there are also several from outtakes."
tt0072007,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Thriller']","A group of police officers burst into a room where a nude female body is hanging from the ceiling. District Attorney Vittoria Stori arrives where she observes the scene to be that of a suicide, with the door bolted from the inside. The following day, Inspector Valentini gives Vittoria the autopsy report, saying that the girl, Sylvia, was 15 and had sexual relations before her death. Valentini talks to Sylvia's maid (her parents are in Africa), who says that Sylvia was being frightened by daily phone calls in which the caller was not responding. Vittoria watches footage of a demonstration and sees Sylvia walk into a building around the time of her death. Sylvia was found in another building, so Vittoria surmises that was murdered.Homicide Inspector Silvestri takes over the case. While visiting the crime scene, a man is spotted photographing from the room of a nearby building. The man, Mr. Paglia, is questioned; he has many pictures of Sylva having sex with a man, taken over a three week period. Silvestri talks to Marcello, the man from the photographs, and he has an alibi (he was been spelunking for days). Marcello tells the inspector that he was not Sylvia's first or only lover. Sylvia's parents return from their African trip and ID the body.The apartment where Sylvia was murdered is discovered; inside, there are photographs and a tape recorder, and the bathroom walls are covered in blood. Mr. Paglia is set free (the cops have nothing to charge him with). Silvestri tells reporters that they do not know if the blood in the bathroom is human.Sylvia's mother tells Vittoria that six months ago she found birth control pills in her daughter's coat pocket, and when she confronted Sylvia about it, her daughter was indifferent. The mother threatened to tell the father, and Sylvia threatened to cut her own throat with a straight razor. Sylvia's mother hired a detective, but he later dropped the case. Silvestri goes to see Sylvia's doctor, who says she was like any other girl her age. The detective's wife does not know where her husband is, and suggests asking his secretary Rosa (his ""latest lay""), in the clinic for a car accident. When the police find the detective's car, he is in the truck in many plastic wrapped pieces.Rosa, upset about her lover's demise, refuses to answer Silvestri's question (where the detective got the money to pay for her three operations); the inspector suggests blackmail. That night a cleaver-wielding person wearing black leather and a motorcycle helmet is outside the clinic. Rosa calls Silvestri and says she now wants to help. The person enters Rosa's room and tells her to say where her lover hid everything. Rosa screams, and the person runs out, followed by Silvestri and a fellow cop. The cop gets his hand chopped off when going for a light switch. Silvestri jumps into a car with Georgina. They chase the killer (on a motorbike), but the killer drives into an old train tunnel and gets away.Back at the clinic, Rosa shows the police the package in the vent, containing tapes. The recordings are of young men and sexual encounters with young schoolgirls, one may mentioning payment and in one instance a girl being raped. Vittoria plays some of the tapes for Sylva's mother and the maid, and they agree that it is the voice of Sylvia. The DA says there are six or seven different voices on the recording. Georgina looks for motorcycles with matching bike tracks, and learns of a butcher (who might have selected a butcher's cleaver as a weapon of choice), purchasing a bike six weeks ago. Later, the cop tells Silvestri and he talked to the butcher's father, and he said that the boy left three months ago and provided Georgina with a photograph.The next day, Silvestri passes by Valentin and his daughter Patricia; he stops when Patricia says ""good morning"" (recognizing her voice from the recordings). The inspector asks Valentine to his office, and Valentine is furious that his daughter is involved with the schoolgirl prostitution ring. Vittoria tries to show Silvestri a threatening note she received the previous night, but he tells her he gets those all the time. She rips up the note. When the DA is dropped off in a parking garage, she is attacked by the killer. She runs and hides behind cars until her driver returns for something she has forgotten. The driver is killed, and Vittoria runs to the elevator. The elevator stops on the third floor and the killer crashes through the door, but runs when someone calls out. The building superintendent clams Vittoria as the killer speeds away on his motorbike.The cops are looking for a butcher named Roberto whom is a suspect in the killings. Valentini has Patricia talk to Silvestri, but she can tell them only that a fellow student, named Julianna, told her about the prostitution. Julianna is picked up, and Silvestri asks her who Bruno is (she had said the name on the tape). She says she has only talked to him over the phone. The police learns that Bruno is the photographer, Mr. Paglia, but the killer has already paid him a visit and stabbed him in the stomach. Bruno dies in the ambulance.The following day, Silvestrai mis-informs reporters that he survived the attack and has told the police everything. Vittoria is angry about the inspector's fabrication, but he tells her that he is trying to weed out the killer and/or people responsible for the prostitution ring.After the story of Bruno's reputed incriminating confession, Sylvia's doctor is found dead in the bathtub from an apparent suicide. Vittoria talks to the quiet girl who attended the doctor's funeral, and she girl tells her of how, for her appointments, the doctor would drug her and do certain things to her. She says that once there was another girl there screaming, and another time a man did things to her. Silvestri returns with many files from the doctor's office, incriminating a number of men involved in the ring (the doctor was ""recruiting"" the girls). Two young girls telephone the police and says they saw the ""fellow on TV"" ride into a garage. The police surround the area. When the black-leather clad biker attempts to shoot his way out, he is gunned down and killed.Silvestri stops a superior and shows him all the files of people trying to bring down; the superior tells him that it would take too much time, and with the killer dead and his promotion, he should not care about the prostitution ring. Silvestri is upset, but Vittoria is there with him, and Valentini tears up his resignation."

She yells abuse as he heads off.2. Franz has led Maria (Sydne Rome), a housemaid on her day off, out of a dance hall on a Sunday evening. They have just met, but soon go and have sex in the park. Afterwards, he quickly loses interest in her and wants to get back to the dance. His reluctant promise to walk her home is soon forgotten as he finds a new partner.3. A hot summer afternoon. Alfred (Helmut Berger), the grown-up son of the household, is home alone with the flirtatious Maria. He is expecting a caller, but seduces Maria. Just as they are having sex on the salon table, the doorbell rings; but there is no-one there by the time she gets to the door. She begs him to stay, but he leaves for the café. She helps herself to a cigar.4. Alfred has borrowed an apartment for an assignation with Emma (Senta Berger), a young married woman. She arrives veiled and nervous, determined not to stay; but after some brandy and candied fruit, allows herself to be seduced. He suffers a bout of impotence and makes grandiose excuses. She teases and pets him; a second go at sex is more successful. Horrified at how late it has become and the lies she is going to have to tell when she gets home, Emma declares that she will never see Alfred again; but they realise that they will be at the same party the following evening.5. Late evening. Emma is reading in bed. Her somewhat older husband Charles (Peter Weck) comes in; one of the periodic Platonic phases of their marriage is about to end. These periods of sexual abstinence, he explains, mean that they can keep having 'honeymoons'. She asks him about the women he slept with before they were married and wonders if married women ever prostitute themselves; he chides her for her curiosity. They make love, recalling the first night of their honeymoon in Venice five years before.6. The Girl (Maria Schneider) has allowed Charles to pick her up in the street and to treat her to dinner in the private room of a restaurant. She is nineteen, at once flirtatious and innocent; he questions her closely, trying to work out just how promiscuous she is. Tipsy with wine and claiming that he reminds her of a former sweetheart, she has sex with him. Afterwards, they fall out; she disbelieves his claims that he is single and from out of town. But they make up, and she agrees to become his mistress.7. The Girl has been for a walk with Robert (Michael Heltau); they return to his apartment. Though it is getting dark, he refuses to light the lamps. He claims that he loves her and asks if she loves him in return. His talk is all literary and self-obsessed; first he says that he is 'Biebitz', a famous playwright, then he insists that he is only a shop assistant. They have sex on the divan. He then says that he knows Biebitz and promises to send her a ticket to his play.8. Robert (who really is Biebitz) and The Actress (Erika Pluhar), who is starring in his latest play, have gone off to a country inn together. Every inch the diva, she teases him mercilessly, claiming still to be devoted to an ex by the name of Fritz. Eventually she invites him to join her in bed, and they have sex. Afterwards, though continuing to wrong-foot him at every turn, she tells him that he is a genius and that she has been sick with love for him.9. The Count (Helmut Lohner), a cavalry officer, is paying a visit to The Actress. Though it is midday, she is still in bed. She is flattered by his compliments on her performance on stage the night before and flirts with him. Though exasperated by his formal manner, she is fascinated by his 'live-for-the-moment' philosophy of life and his aristocratic fastidiousness. When she offers herself to him, he at first declines, saying that he dislikes having sex in the mornings. But he can't resist her for long. Afterwards, they arrange to meet again when she returns from the theatre that evening.10. Early morning. The Count is in Leocadia's room. She is asleep in the bed; he has woken up, still dressed, on the couch, nursing a hangover and trying to remember how he got there. He is about to leave, when she wakes. He is struck by her beauty and asks her about her life. She reminds him of someone from his past and he kisses her eyes, thinking that has been their only intimacy; but the fantasy is shattered when she tells him that they had drunken sex the night before. He walks out into the deserted street as day dawns over Vienna."
tt0072081,"['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Mystery']","The bumbling French Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) has been temporarily demoted to beat cop by his boss, Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), who despises Clouseau to the point of obsession. However, the French government forces Dreyfus to reinstate Clouseau as the Inspector of the Sûreté (as they had been planning to anyway, much to Dreyfus' chagrin) so that he can go to the fictional Middle Eastern nation of Lugash to investigate the theft of the fabled Pink Panther diamond, which has once again been stolen.Clouseau's investigation at the Lugash National Museum, which he nearly destroys with his klutzy ways, lead him to believe that Sir Charles Litton (Christopher Plummer), the notorious Phantom, is re-creating the most infamous heist of his career. Clouseau is delighted at this, and sees this as his only chance to get his revenge on Litton for framing him and temporarily sending him to prison (in the first Pink Panther film). Although Clouseau fails to uncover any leads into the theft, his bumbling allows him to survive several attempts on his life by a mysterious assassin. After staking out, and nearly demolishing, the Litton Manor in Nice, Clouseau is tricked into leaving France. He follows Sir Charles' wife, Lady Claudine (Catherine Schell) to a resort hotel in Gstaad, Switzerland, where his attempts to investigate her repeatedly fail.Meanwhile in England, Sir Charles reads about the theft and realizes that he has been framed. He goes to Lugash to investigate, encountering various underworld figures of old acquaintance, and foils several attempts on his life. Litton eventually manages to discover that the thief of the diamond is his wife, Lady Claudine. Because they were both bored with their quiet retirement, she stole the diamond for her own excitement, then sent her husband on a wild goose chase for his. Sir Charles makes a daring escape from Lugash and goes to Gstaad to find his wife and the diamond to clear his name.Inspector Clouseau, who has unknowingly been on the trail of the real thief all along, receives a telephone call from Chief Inspector Dreyfus telling him to arrest Lady Claudine. However, when Clouseau calls Dreyfus back to ask why, he is informed that Dreyfus has been on vacation for the past week. Dreyfus, now revealed as the assassin trying to kill Clouseau, prepares to shoot him with a sniper rifle as soon as he enters Lady Claudine's room.Lady Claudine playfully confesses the theft to her husband, and hands the diamond over to him, so he can go about proving his innocence. They are cornered by Colonel Sharky (Peter Arne) of the Lugash Secret Police, who intends to kill both of them. It turns out he has been using the theft of the diamond as an excuse to purge his political opponents. Just then, Clouseau barges into the room to arrest the Littons. Sir Charles points out that Colonel Sharky is going to kill them all. Suddenly, Dreyfus opens fire on the room, and manages to accidentally kill Sharky while aiming at Clouseau, who has ducked at the last minute to check his fly. During the fray, Clouseau is forced to allow the Littons to escape.For once again recovering the Pink Panther, Clouseau is promoted to Chief Inspector, while Sir Charles resumes his career as a jewel thief (Lady Claudine's fate is not mentioned). At a Japanese restaurant in the epilogue, Cato unexpectedly attacks Clouseau again and triggers a massive brawl, naturally destroying the premises. In a post credits scene, Dreyfus is committed to a lunatic asylum for his actions, where he is straitjacketed inside a padded cell and vows revenge on Clouseau.

They untie him. The eating agents see the three guys drive off with Sun Ra and run back to their van, pursuing them in it.The Overseer and Jimmy Fey talk backstage at the hall. The Overseer remarks that there's no Sun Ra, and tells Fey to send the audience home. The hall is crowded. Fey attempts to entertain the crowd at a microphone and the discontent audience chants, ""We want Ra!"" repeatedly. Fey introduces Sun Ra, who has made it to the place. Sun Ra takes a seat onstage behind some keyboards. The Overseer stands back, waiting for what he calls Sun Ra's ""concession."" Sun Ra and the Arkestra perform some electronic music, with him and June Tyson doing some chanting together.The two agents from earlier step backstage, one of them holding a handgun. He points it at Sun Ra. The two youths who rescued Sun Ra see this. They run across the stage, and one of them leaps between the agent and Sun Ra. The agent fires his gun, accidentally shooting the youth. The surprised Overseer walks away. The fat guy grabs the shooter and pulls him to the floor. The other agent points his gun at Sun Ra, who makes the wounded youth and his friend disappear, only to show up in Sun Ra's spaceship. The youth who was shot is somehow unhurt and blows bubblegum. Sun Ra magically transports the fat guy to the ship, then he disappears himself.The Overseer returns to the brothel, saying, ""There's no way he can beat me this time."" He greets two seated prostitutes, one of them bandaged due to her beating from the NASA man. She vanishes, then the other one does too, both of them appearing in Sun Ra's ship.At the pool hall, the two guys from an earlier scene see the door mysteriously open. They stop playing pool, then one of them drops his dope-shooting tools onto a table and steps outside through a crowd gathered around Sun Ra's ship. This guy tells Sun Ra that he did drugs because he felt he didn't fit in anywhere. Sun Ra lets him onto the ship. Jimmy is also allowed onto the ship, but Sun Ra says that he will take Jimmy's ""black part"" with him, allowing Fey to go without it. In the brothel, the Overseer calls for Jimmy, who appears in front of him, his speech sounding more stereotypically ""white."" Another bandaged hooker sits beside the Overseer. Jimmy escorts her out of the brothel. The Overseer yells, ""RA, YOU SON OF A BITCH!"" and storms outside.Sun Ra, surrounded by his entourage, says farewell to Earth, gets onto his spaceship, and it takes off.

They drive through a wooded area, where they see lingerie-clad mannequins hanging. The couple winds up back at Barbara's motel. Christian tells Barbara about a terrible childhood incident with his father, and Barbara explains that Alex is not her boyfriend but more of a provider. After some flirtation, Barbara makes an odd request: Christian must shave his beard before the two have sex. He complies. As Christian shaves in the bathroom, he hears a noise outside. He pokes his head out the open window and is assaulted by a man with a gun. The man, Tatum (Adolfo Lastretti), enters the bathroom and threatens Christian. A brief struggle ensues wherein Tatum is shot and killed. Christian leaves the bathroom and tells Barbara everything. Strangely at ease with the concept of a dead man in her room, she convinces Christian that the best thing to do is run. The pair go to a friend's place, a seaside castle and lighthouse.Christian insists that his brother Fritz (Ivan Rassimov) can help, but Barbara insists that no one can. The arguing pair are interrupted by squatters Malcolm and Clorinda (Guido Alberti and Monica Monet). Malcolm taunts Christian with a story about a local murder. Believing news of Tatum's death has reached the news, Christian admits that he's the killer, but Malcolm explains that he was just joking. Confused, Christian retires for the night. Clorinda tells Christian that he knows her, and a possibly hallucinatory rape scene ensues. Christian then goes downstairs to see Barbara.The next day, Barbara is gone. Christian searches her motel room, where there is no body nor weapon, to the marina where there is no boat and he's followed by an ominous man and ultimately back to the tower where he sees Malcolm talking to that same man, Luca. Increasingly going out of his mind. He travels to the marina, and finds his boat anchor missing. Christian spends the rest of the day in the tower. That night, he thinks he sees Tatum on the grounds. Making his way down, he discovers Malcolm dead. Christian leaves in a panic, catching a brief glimpse of an arm at the bottom of the well.Desperate for a safe place, Christian goes to his original girlfriend's apartment. After spending the night there, he's accosted by Tatum, who is very much alive. Tatum forces him to drive to a quarry, revealing along the way that the plan wasn't supposed to involve killing him, just driving him crazy, but since he's being stubborn about it, he has to die. Attempting to make it look like an accident, Tatum has him drive to the edge of the cliff and exits the car. Quickly turning the tables on Tatum, Christian reverses the car, smacking Tatum with the open door and running him over twice. Realizing that there is a conspiracy against him, he switches clothes with Tatum, puts his necklace around Tatum's neck, shoves the dead body in the car and pushes it off the cliff.Barbara and Luca (Franco Silva) arrive to make sure that ""Christian"" is dead. As they leave, Christian follows them back to his family's factory, currently being run by his brother Fritz. It is revealed that Tatum was right: the plan was to drive Christian mad so that he has no claim on the family fortune. Barbara reveals that she has fallen for Christian and is sick of both Luca and Fritz because Christian wasn't supposed to die. The two men are satisfied, though, and tell her to shut up and go along with it.Christian wanders the roads, disguising himself as a male prostitute and getting picked up by a female client.After leaving the factory, Luca and Barbara are planning their getaway. Christian interrupts them and reveals that he knows about the plot. Barbara admits to everything. The two reconcile and make plans to escape. As the pair lovingly make up, Christian begins to see Clorinda's face, his ex-girlfriend's face and the random woman who picked him up for prostitution. He chokes Barbara to death and runs away.Fritz meanwhile has investigated the car crash and figures out that it's not Christian's body in the wreckage. Retreating to his mansion, he decides to indulge in some old family movies. As he's watching them, its revealed that Christian had mental problems as a child, and that his father's lunacy is hereditary. As he hears that, he begins to have flashbacks. It is revealed that Clorinda was the nurse at the psychiatric hospital and that Malcolm was the doctor. Additionally, its shown that he has killed Clorinda after the potential rape and dumped her in the well, that he killed the ex-girlfriend, the random woman in the car and Barbara. Alex shoots him, fatally wounding him, but Christian manages to run away. As he bleeds out, Christian makes his way back to the beach where he originally found Barbara and dies.Fritz wanders home, and makes his way to a closet full of lingerie-clad mannequins, all with puncture marks and other disfigurements. As he slowly makes his way to a particular mannequin, we hear the voice-over again telling us that the insanity is hereditary as he repeatedly stabs the mannequin, releasing his pent up rage and craziness."

tt0072226,"['Crime', 'Drama']","The real incident took place in May of 1969. This one is about February of 1973, just west of Houston, Texas (Sugarland in actuality), Clovis Poplin is serving the remainder of his one year prison sentence in pre-release at the TDC Pre-Release Facility for petty larceny. His wife Lou Jean is also newly released from prison and comes to visit him with the intention of breaking him out because she just lost their child to foster parents that intend to adopt Baby Langston. She threatens to leave him for good if he does not go along with her plan. Clovis and Lou Jean are uneducated and not playing with a full deck; Clovis is naïve and easily manipulated and Lou Jean is beautiful, but annoying, ignorant, impulsive, and borderline sociopathic.Lou Jean is wearing Clovis' clothes underneath hers and they very easily sneak out of the facility, posing as visiting friends of Clovis' fellow prison mate, Hubie Nocker. They hitch a ride out with his parents, with his father driving on the freeway less than 25 miles an hour. A young patrol officer by the name of Maxwell Slide stops him and gives him a warning citation. Fearing that the young officer will spot them, Clovis and Lou Jean steal the elderly couple's 1956 Buick Roadmaster skidding and speeding over the Brazos River and through the town of Richmond, wrecking the car near a slough. Lou Jean pretends to be badly injured, and Patrolman Slide is kidnapped at gunpoint. Because Slide is new and inexperienced to the force, they seem to have little problem with his cooperation.Veteran police Captain Tanner is in the middle of a court hearing in Houston and the hearing immediately adjourned until later so he can get to the kidnapping. Tanner is a mannered and genteel soul who seems sympathetic to the Poplin's and Slide's dilemma, but realizes with his job he needs to stick to his principles and do the right thing.During the trip across Alternate Highway 90 and Interstate 10, the local radio station reveals Clovis to be a native of Crowley, a small town just south of Fort Worth and Lou Jean as an unemployed beautician from Sayers, a town just east of San Antonio. The Poplin's stop at a porta potty in the road so Lou Jean can relieve herself, an Exxon Humble filling station with cop cars escorting them, an Arco filling station taking a load of gold stamps, two Louisiana state troopers join in and participate, stop at a chicken stand in Pleasanton, then take Loop 1604. At a Fina gas station in Converse, Slide zooms his police car to escape the convoy of police cars so they can rest for the night.Clovis, Lou Jean, and Officer Slide hide out for the night at a used car lot near the old Loop 13 Drive In Movie Theater on Military Drive, with Slide handcuffed to the backseat of the police car and Clovis and Lou Jean staying in an RV. Captain Tanner and half the state police force are using the Harlandale ISD football stadium for the night.Captain Tanner has summoned Lou Jean's father from his home in Sayers by helicopter to make a statement to her via police radio to persuade her to turn herself in. He's an elderly man, courteous to the police officers, but just as ignorant and uneducated as Lou Jean and states on the radio that she's no good, would shoot her and Clovis if he had a chance, and that God will get her. Lou Jean does not hear this, but Slide hears it on the police radio in the car just before she comes to check on him. He assures her that he knows she's really a good person inside and comes to realize her upbringing was not a pleasant one.The next morning, an unidentified trio of leftist lunatics leave their home with intent to find Lou Jean and Clovis. They spot them at the used car lot and, acting no better than their upbringing taught them, shoot at the car's helpless occupants repeatedly. The police get wind of the incident and arrest the men, who are not the National Guard they claim to be. Tanner assures Clovis and Lou Jean that they will be left alone. But Tanner realizes he still needs to do his job. He asks the couple and baby to hide in a downtown shelter and enlists two sharpshooters to their home to kill the couple.Down the trip on Highway 90 from San Antonio to Sugarland (Del Rio in reality of this movie, except the filming location of the home and downtown was actually Floresville), Tanner dodges media, the trio in the police car are welcomed and supported by a large crowd in the fictional town of Rodrigo (probably Hondo), and they make it to the house.Clovis does not want to get out of the car and fears it's a trap, but Lou Jean pushes him to do it. Clovis is shot in the chest. The three of them drive to the Rio Grande river to cross the border, but Clovis dies at the wheel right before he can escape.After Clovis dies, Lou Jean is arrested and Officer Slide consoled by Captain Tanner for his bravery and a job well done. Lou Jean served 15 months of a 5 year prison sentence and was awarded custody by the state after getting out on parole."
tt0072251,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Thriller']","In New York City, four heavily armed men with code names (Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, Mr. Grey, and Mr. Brown), wearing disguises of eyeglasses, fedora hats, and fake moustashes, board at different station stops (the Green Line at 59th Street, Grey Line at 51st Street, Brown Line at Grand Central, and finally Blue Line at 28th Street) on the Pelham 123 subway train run of the 6 Lexington Avenue Local service. The men take the train, securing a group of hostages, whom they isolate in one car of the train, then disconnect this car from the rest of the train.Meanwhile, Lieutenant Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau), a cynical and curmudgeonly yet light-hearted New York City Transit Authority police lieutenant, begins his day by leading four visiting Tokyo Metro directors on a tour of New York's subway command-center. This is interrupted by Blue's radio announcement to the command center that ""your train has been taken."" Blue (Robert Shaw), the British-accented leader of the hijackers, tells Garber they are demanding a ransom of one million dollars, to be delivered to them within one hour; otherwise they will kill one passenger per minute, starting when the hour has passed.Garber, the sarcastic Lieutenant Rico Patrone (Jerry Stiller), and other transit workers cooperate while trying to guess how the criminals intend to escape the subway tunnel and get away. Various clues soon surface for Garber to figure out, first with his hearing Blue's very distinctive English accent over the radio. It later turns out that Blue was a ruthless British mercenary, and Green (Martin Balsam) is a former transit worker who from time to time sneezes over the radio and is heard by Garber, who responds by saying ""Gesundheit."" Garber also learns that one of the hostages is an undercover police officer.The mayor finally agrees to pay the ransom at the urging of his deputy mayor. The police dispatch a squad car carrying the ransom money. When the car is wrecked in a collision, Garber daringly bluffs to buy some time, telling the takers that the money already has been delivered to the 28th Street Station and only the walk down the tunnel is delaying it. A reluctant Blue agrees to the delay.A police motorcycle completes the trip from the scene of the collision to the subway station and two unarmed officers are sent down the track on foot to deliver the money to the hijackers. With the money finally in hand, the hijackers demand that electric power be restored to the subway line, and that all signals in the path of the train be turned green from 28th Street to the South Ferry station, both of these being necessary for the car to move. Having overridden the subway car's dead-man's switch, which would otherwise ensure its stopping unless someone remained at the throttle, the hijackers get off the train and set it in motion. As the train starts to move, the undercover officer also jumps off the train and hides between the rails. The car begins to travel faster and faster, since no one is controlling its speed.Outside the tunnel, Garber and Inspector Daniels are convinced that the runaway train is a diversion and that the hijackers must have left the train.The hijackers divide the ransom money, discard their disguises, and start their escape into the tunnel's emergency exit; however, Grey refuses to leave his gun behind as agreed and is shot dead by Blue. The undercover officer, still hiding in the tracks, manages to kill Brown with one shot. Green escapes onto the street.Garber arrives after Green has gotten away and, drawing on Blue, orders him to surrender just as Blue is about to shoot the undercover officer. Blue asks Garber if the death penalty is available in the state of New York anymore. Told that it is not, Blue responds, ""Pity"", then promptly electrocutes himself by stepping onto the third rail while a horrified Garber watches.Entering the South Ferry Loop, the runaway car finally encounters a red signal. The car's emergency brakes are tripped and it grinds to a halt; the remaining hostages are all safe.Green, the only hijacker to escape, has left as a clue only Garber's surmise that one of the hijackers must be an ex-motorman of the New York Transit Authority (owing to the hijackers' knowledge of the car's operation). With the dead three all identified, Garber realizes that the hijacker still at large must be the former transit employee. Garber and Patrone, working their way through a list of former motormen ""discharged for cause"" (and, by implication, disgruntled), pay a visit to Harold Longman. Longman, known to the audience as Mr. Green, is shown rolling in the packs of ransom money on the bed in his seedy efficiency apartment when Garber and Patrone knock on his door. He hides the money quickly, then opens to the officers and bluffs his way through their questioning. The officers find Longman's alibi weak, but start out the door, until Longman sneezes and Garber says ""Gesundheit."" Garber then re-opens the door, the expression on his face in the door opening (the film's final frame) telling the audience that he knows he has just found the final hijacker."
tt0072271,"['Horror', 'contentRating', 'R']","The film opens on the date of August 18, 1973 by revealing that a cemetery in rural Texas has been vandalized; several gravesites have been desecrated, the bodies dug up and arranged into bizarre ""sculptures"". Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) and her invalid, wheelchair-bound brother, Franklin (Paul A. Partain), are concerned that their grandfather's grave may have been vandalized, so they travel to the site with three of their friends, Sally's boyfriend Jerry (Allen Danziger), her best friend Pam (Teri McMinn), and Pam's boyfriend Kirk (William Vail). When they discover that the grave is intact, they decide to visit the old family homestead which is now abandoned.Along the way, they pass a slaughterhouse and Franklin describes how cattle used to be killed with a sledgehammer, and now they use an air gun. Shortly afterwards, they pick up a skinny, strange-looking hitch hiker (Edwin Neal) who exhibits bizarre behavior. After inviting the group back to his house for dinner, an invitation they all decline, the hitchhiker takes a photo of Franklin with an instant polarid camara, and demands a two-dollar payment for it. When Franklin refuses, the man angrily crumples the photo, sets it on fire, and cuts his own hand with Franklin's pocket knife. The guys manage to throw him out of the van, but not before he cuts Franklin with the knife, too. Before they can drive away, he smears blood on their van.Running low on fuel, they stop at a rural Gulf filling station, only to have the strange-looking old man who runs it (Jim Siedow) tell them that the tanks are empty and that he's waiting for the gas tanker to show up. When the old man learns that their destination is the old Hardesty home, he advises the young people against going there by saying that the people who live around that area are not receptive to strangers. They buy some barbeque sandwiches from the old man and depart for the family home which they finaly arrive a short while later. While Sally and Pam go off to look through the abandoned house, Franklin finds it hard to get around the old place due to his wheelchair, and he is frustrated by the fun that the two couples seem to be having.Franklin gives Pam and Kirk directions to an old swimming hole that used to be nearby, but they find it completely dried up. Kirk hears the sound of a gas generator nearby and gets the idea to find out where it is and barter for some gasoline. Following the sound, they discover a large farm house surrounded by numerous abandonded vehicles, partially hidden by a large tarp. Kirk finds a human tooth on the front porch and frightens Pam with it. He gets no answer to a knock at the door, and he is lured inside by strange animal sounds. He goes into the house and in the space of a few moments, an enormous heavyset man in a weird mask (Gunnar Hansen) appears and murders him with a blow to the head via sledgehammer. The man, known as ""Leatherface"" due to his mask made out of a human face, drags the body into a back room.Pam becomes restless when Kirk does not return, and she goes into the house to look for him. She stumbles into a room that is filled with human and animal bones. A live chicken dangles in a small bird cage. Weird sculptures made out of human skulls hang from the ceiling. Furniture is adorned with human bones and skulls. The floor is covered with bits of bones and feathers. Pam begins to retch and starts screaming, when Leatherface appears and lunges for her. She runs out onto the porch but he catches her, carrying her kicking and screaming back into the house, where he savagely hangs her on a meat hook through her back. While she hangs there, she can see Leatherface dismembering the dead body of Kirk with a chainsaw.Back at the Hardesty house, Sally and the others start to wonder why Pam and Kirk have not returned. As the sun begins to set, Jerry sets out in the general direction and also comes upon the house after he is lured to the area by the sound of the house's gas generator. He is alerted by the blanket that Kirk left hanging on the front porch, and he goes into the house. After Jerry walks into the kitchen, he discovers Pam locked inside a large freezer, still alive but convulsing and near death. She lunges out of the freezer just as Leatherface appears and kills Jerry with the sledgehammer. He forces Pam's body back into the freezer and locks it again. Leatherface is clearly distraught, apparently upset because strangers keep coming to his house.At nightfall, Sally and Franklin are forced to go after Jerry when he does not return; Jerry took the keys to the van with him when he left. Franklin refuses to wait at the van and insists that Sally push his wheelchair along the unpaved path through the woods. Before they get to the house, they are attacked by Leatherface, who murders Franklin by ramming him in the chest with a chainsaw. Sally flees in terror with Leatherface directly behind her. She gets cut on the thorny brush as she runs, eventually reaching the house; she is unaware that the house belongs to her pursuer. Sally runs upstairs as Leatherface saws through the front door to get at her. In an upstairs bedroom, she finds two dessicated figures, an old man and old woman. The woman is long dead, but the old man is still barely alive, hideously withered. Leatherface corners her on the second floor, so she leaps out a window and runs from the house again with him right behind her.Sally reaches the gas station and Leatherface disappears. The old man says he's going to take Sally to get help, and while he's gone Sally notices the smoke pit where the barbeque is made. She stares at it in fascination. The old man returns and suddenly attacks Sally, who tries to defend herself with a kitchen knife. But the old man knocks the knife out of Sally's hand with a broom. The old man beats Sally unconcious with the broom, uses the knife to cut some twine to tie her up, he then puts a gunny sack over her head and forcing her into his pickup truck. He drives her back to the dreaded house, and along the way picks up the hitch hiker from earlier in the day. They all live there, along with Leatherface. They tie Sally to a chair inside the house and remove the bag from her
head. She and the hitch hiker recognize one another and Sally screams in horror.The family torments her for the rest of the night, forcing her to sit at their table while they eat a meal that is obviously made up of human flesh. They bring ""Grandpa"" down from upstairs, the dessicated old man, and slice Sally's finger open, sticking it in the old man's mouth while he sucks her blood. They tell Sally that ""Grandpa"" used to work in the
slaughterhouse and was the best with a sledgehammer there was. They decide to let Grandpa kill Sally and untie her, forcing her onto her knees and holding her head over a bucket while Grandpa makes several feeble attempts to hit her head with a hammer. The hitch hiker gets frustrated and makes a grab for the hammer to finish her off, and suddenly Sally breaks free. She hurls herself out a window again and lands outside just as dawn begins to break.The hitchhiker and Leatherface emerge from the house and chase Sally up to the road, the hitch hiker brandishing a knife and Leatherface waving the chainsaw. The hitchhiker very nearly catches her, grabbing for her and catching her hair over and over. A large semi drives by and the hitch hiker is caught off guard; the truck drives over him, killing him. The truck driver slows down and gets out of the rig to see what happened, only to be confronted by a screaming, bloodied Sally with Leatherface close behind, the chainsaw buzzing. He chases Sally and the truck driver to the other side of the cab, when the driver hurls a wrench at him and hits him in the side of the head. Leatherface drops the saw and falls, wounded in the leg by the saw blade. The truck driver flees down the road, but the wounded Sally cannot catch up. Then a pickup truck drives by and Sally abandons the scene by jumping in the back of the truck. Leatherface still gives chase, but the pickup driver pulls away. Sally laughs crazily at Leatherface as she escapes, giggling at him as he swings his chainsaw around in frustration and rage in the middle of the road in the full light of dawn."

tt0072281,"['Action', 'Adventure']","D'Artagnan (Michael York) and his father (Joss Ackland) engage in an exhausting sparring duel. The father shows his son a signature move, which ends with the point of the sword at his son's chest, and advises to use it in a fight only as a last resort. He gives the boy 15 crowns and a letter to the commander of the King's musketeers, then presents him a sword he and his own father used in the King's service. The young Gascon leaves home on a huge yellow workhorse with his few belongings and a salve his mother advises him to rub into any wounds, and he strikes out for Paris to take his place as a musketeer.As D'Artagnan arrives in Paris he comes upon Rochefort (Christopher Lee), a tall man with a patch over one eye, who makes an offhanded remark to some companions about the newcomer's horse. Anxious to fight at any opportunity, as his father suggested, the young Gascon challenges Rochefort, only to have his sword struck in two. He is knocked out as his new enemy goes to meet an approaching carriage. Rochefort greets the passenger inside--Milady DeWinter (Faye Dunaway)-- and tells her she must go to England to report on the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward). The pair are spies for Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston). D'Artagnan again tries to pick a fight but ends up falling in the mud.Finding the musketeers' headquarters, D'Artagnan awaits an appointment with their commander M. Treville (Georges Wilson). As he makes his way through the indoor training ground, he sees Porthos (Frank Finlay) having his portrait done while Aramis (Richard Chamberlain) watches; outside Treville's office, Athos (Oliver Reed) has a shoulder wound attended to. Treville reads D'Artagnan's letter and asks to see the familiar sword, which D'Artagnan sheepishly produces; the commander knows the weapon, realizes what has happened and lets him borrow a new one. Unfortunately there is no place in the musketeers for him, Treville says, until he has established his reputation on campaign or in killing, but a place in the guard might be suited to him in the meantime. Suddenly D'Artagnan spots Rochefort outside and leaps from the window. . .only to be hoisted back up as he lands on a scaffold. Excusing himself to Treville, he hastily runs from the office and collides with Athos and his wounded shoulder. The musketeer says D'Artagnan needs a lesson in manners, and they agree to duel at the Carmelite Convent at 12:00. Hurrying downstairs to catch up with Rochefort, the Gascon knocks Porthos down, causing a wardrobe malfunction which embarrasses him, so they agree to duel at the Luxembourg at 1:00. Once outside, D'Artagnan mistakenly compromises a lady trying to get Aramis' attention, so the musketeer and intended priest decides to have the young man meet him at 2:00 to settle the matter with swords.At the convent, it turns out that D'Artagnan's other two appointments are with Athos' dueling seconds. Before the duel can begin, however, six of the Cardinal's guards appear and prepare to charge at the musketeers for dueling, which is against the law. D'Artagnan joins the outnumbered threesome, noting that he may not have a tunic, but has the heart of a musketeer. Together they make short order of the guards, and Athos has an opportunity to see that the Gascon is a good swordsman. The remaining two guards surrender, but not before Porthos finds that his hat has been cleaved in two and lifts twenty pistoles from a downed guard to pay the damages (and twenty more to teach them manners). Later Athos explains that the musketeer motto is ""one for all, all for one,"" so each of them gets ten pistoles from the booty, which Athos suggests D'Artagnan use to get lodgings and a servant. He chooses Planchet (Roy Kinnear) for a servant, and takes dingy lodgings at two francs a day with the elderly M. Bonacieux (Spike Milligan) and his wife Constance (Raquel Welch), a clumsy but beautiful younger woman and the dressmaker to Queen Anne of Austria (Geraldine Chaplin).Porthos bets and loses all of their money, so the group enter a tavern; Porthos makes it a point to annoy Aramis and they start to duel, but when D'Artagnan tries to quell the swordplay, Athos pulls him back. The men are creating a distraction while they rustle some much-needed food and drink. D'Artagnan and Planchet soon get into the spirit, passing the pilfered food to Athos, who hides it under his cloak. When they depart, Athos throws a purse to the barkeep, which he secretly filled with salt, they make their escape and fill their bellies with the hard-won food.At the palace, the Cardinal arrives, and locals are paid to wave flags and cheer his coming, as he is despised by many for manipulating the power of the King (Jean-Pierre Cassel) to his own advantage. The King discusses the musketeers' fight with Richelieu's ""ruffians,"" and is worried because the Duke of Buckingham has arrived in France and covets his wife Anne, but Richelieu assures him that she is faithful; in secret he has a plot he is about to set in motion.At night Rochefort and his men break into M. Bonacieux's home while he is in bed with Constance, and prepare to take the couple to the Bastille, but Constance fumbles her way free and returns home and into D'Artagnan's arms. Later she leaves, saying she has to stop somewhere before she continues to the palace and the Queen, and makes him promise not to follow her, but he worries about her safety and trails after her from a distance to discover her meeting with another man. He challenges the interloper, then finds out it is the Duke of Buckingham himself. He helps escort the Duke and Constance to the palace laundry where Buckingham meets with Anne and begs her for a token he can hold until they can be together for good. She gives him a necklace containing twelve diamond studs. Suddenly guards appear and the Duke is outnumbered and in danger of being discovered, but D'Artagnan assists and Planchet brings the other musketeers as well, and they defeat the guards while the Duke makes his escape.At the Bastille, the Cardinal meets with Bonacieux and accuses him of treachery, then upbraids Rochefort for failing to hold onto Constance; Rochefort tells the Cardinal that Anne has given the diamond studs to Buckingham. The Cardinal releases Bonacieux, befriending him with a gift of 100 pistoles to get him to spy on his own wife. At an outing, the Cardinal mentions to the King that he wants to see the queen dance, and they plan a ball in her honor in two weeks' time. Richelieu suggests to the King that she should wear the diamond studs, and he approaches Anne with the request. The Cardinal later gives him a box with two diamond studs inside, and prompts him to count the studs when Anne wears the necklace and question her if they are all not there. He has sent Milady DeWinter to England and, in a tryst with Buckingham while he is wearing the token of Anne's affection, Milady has stolen the two studs the Cardinal has given the King. For the Queen to appear without them will cause her dishonor and may well cost Anne her life.Desperate to get the studs back, the Queen writes a letter to Buckingham and gives it to Constance, who is prepared to entrust it to her husband, but when he mentions that the Cardinal ""took my hand and called me friend,"" she refuses to reveal more, so Bonacieux goes out to fetch Rochefort. D'Artagnan has been listening unseen, and volunteers to take the letter as he loves her and knows how to get to England. He locates the purse of 100 pistoles to use for the trip, but the pair are forced to quickly hide in a wardrobe when Bonacieux arrives with Rochefort and his men; after no trace of the pair is found, they leave. Constance faints and the wardrobe crashes to the ground. D'Artagnan breaks out of the wooden wardrobe, angered by the continued interference of the ""inconvenient"" Rochefort. Athos later tells the Gascon to avoid the man as he is a dangerous swordsman for the Cardinal. The trio of musketeers agree to help D'Artagnan get the letter to Buckingham and ride out with the agreement that if one falls, the others continue on their way.At a tavern Porthos gets into an argument with a man and, as they duel it out, the others ride on. The man slices into the musketeer's outfit, drawing blood, and Porthos drops to the ground. Later Athos and Aramis are set upon by thieves; Aramis is held at gunpoint, and D'Artagnan and Planchet watch from a distance, shocked, as Athos is cut at the throat in a duel. They continue to the docks to board a ship for England, but have no pass. Rochefort has a signed pass to board, but needs the governor to countersign, so he takes the road to town. On Rochefort's return, D'Artagnan accosts him, and when they recognize each other they fight a rough duel in the dark. Rochefort is wounded by D'Artagnan but not killed, and the Gascon suffers scraped ribs. Planchet nabs the pass, and when the harbor master questions why there are two people with one pass, D'Artagnan notes that he is one person, and Planchet is a servant.An exhausted D'Artagnan arrives in England, having taken six days. Buckingham is ready to hand over the studs but suddenly realizes that two studs are missing and figures out that Milady took them. His jeweler O'Reilly (Frank Finlay) is able to perfectly reproduce the two studs, and Buckingham hands the packet over to D'Artagnan, asking how he can repay him. D'Artagnan notes that they are enemies, but Buckingham offers a handshake and a sword which he accepts. With Planchet at his heels, they manage to get to Paris before the ball starts. At the familiar location of one of his companions' duels, D'Artagnan jumps upon a fresh horse, cutting a rope attached to the pommel, not knowing that two of his fellow musketeers are using the horse to pull Athos out of a well he has fallen into. The musketeers are wounded but recuperating. They realize from the accident with the horse that D'Artagnan has returned successfully and head out to join him at the ball.The Queen arrives on the arm of the King, but she is wearing a pearl necklace and he demands she wear the diamond studs; stalling for time, she says she will send to the palace for them and departs to wait with her dressmaker in hope of being saved. When Constance looks out a balcony window, she upsets a pot of flowers and D'Artagnan immediately knows from the accident where to go; he creates a distraction with musicians and prematurely set-off fireworks, but is delayed in getting the studs to Constance when the guards appear. The musketeers soon arrive and with the help of Planchet, who infiltrated the ball in a polar bear costume, they manage to subdue the guards. D'Artagnan throws the packet with the studs up to Constance, but they are thrown into the wrong window. Milady picks it up, but Constance bursts in and the two women fight until D'Artagnan swings in to assist. Constance is able to nab the valuable packet.The Queen reappears at the ball and reveals the studs at her neck. After the King tries unsuccessfully to count them while dancing with his wife, he stops the music and reveals the box containing the two studs which the Cardinal had given him; she delightedly says she now has fourteen studs. Backpedaling, the Cardinal says he wanted to give the additional studs to her but could not bring himself to do so directly. Milady informs the Cardinal that D'Artagnan thwarted the plot, but the Cardinal says the game continues.At an elaborate ceremony, Treville announces that D'Artagnan has become a musketeer; his comrades put the tunic over his shoulders while the commander provides his musket. The Queen greets him and, when she offers her hand, she discreetly gives him a ring as thanks for saving her honor. Milady flirtatiously passes by the new musketeer as D'Artagnan, joined by Constance and his friends, head to new adventures, and they become the Four Musketeers."
tt0072300,"['Adventure', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","The steamy summer of 1974 Galveston, Texas is the backdrop for this ""Blaxplotation"" Classic, starring Lincoln Kilpatrick as ""Billy Most"" a misunderstood, troubled, cross dressing ex-con, who misguidedly obsesses over yearning to birth, suckle, nurture and rear his own progeny. Yet, due to obvious gender issues, is rendered incapable and sublimates by kidnapping a young Black boy to call his own.The missing boy however has attachments to a community of teen youths, led by H.J. ""Ahmad Nurradin"" and four of his fellow ""soul brothers and one ""Good-Cop"", ""Mr. Kool"", played by Ed Bernard of ""Police Story-circa 1974"".The storyline, though choppy and mellow dramatic; offers a very real snapshot of 1970's Urban America. Big Afros, Race Based Slang, tube tops, Hip-Hugger Pants, Run-Down Shanties, Drugs, Pimps and assorted other stereotypes depicting the plight or making fun of a world left standing untouched in the wake of the 1960's Civil Rights Movement.As a jumping off point, ""Mr. Kool"" a mentor to ""The Brothers"" is brutally murdered by our antagonist, as he rescues the young boy who is subsequently rendered unable to speak. That is where our young vigilante group ""The Brothers"" band together to identify the killer and assist the police, by any means necessary.As with many movies of its day; the body of work would be considered racist, politically incorrect and possibly written off as bad cinema. Yet its cast of mostly unknowns, juxtaposed to a decaying industrial quadrant of 1970's Galveston, Texas actually works. Barry White issues a one and only sound track. Raw, and very indicative of the times.
Citizen Kane, Shaft, Blackula, Super Fly, no! But, it has a plot, the over-riding theme is Over-Coming, not being overtaken by the environment, and for a 1974 audience starved for young Blacks out to help themselves by helping each other, it provides a nice little snack. This work may be hard to find, but if you can, check it out.See it several times and remember. Marvel at the dated slang, and remember that this genre of film was still in infancy and literally just a breath away from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Enjoy."
tt0072308,"['Action', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","In the opening scene, Doug Roberts (Paul Newman) travels by helicopter to San Francisco where he is chief architect for Duncan Enterprises, an architectural firm specializing in skyscrapers. Their greatest project, the Glass Tower, is 1,800 feet high and with 137-floors. It is set for dedication in San Francisco, and a lavish ceremony is scheduled to include Mayor Robert Ramsey (Jack Collins) and Senator Gary Parker (Robert Vaughn). Jim Duncan (William Holden), the company's president, is wooing Senator Parker because his support for an urban renewal effort will allow the company to build more such skyscrapers. When Roberts flies back to San Francisco for the party, he finds in his office his fiancee, magazine editor Susan Franklin (Faye Dunaway), and when the two renew romantic acquaintances, she reveals that she has received a long-sought promotion - which throws a wrench into their plans to move to the countryside to have a family.Doug, however, is interrupted when he gets a call from the Tower utility room in the building's massive basement. In routine checking of the building's generators, a power surge blows out a circuit breaker - and unknown to everyone the surge blows out another circuit breaker, this one on the 81st floor in a large storage closet that sends a wire flopping onto shop rags that catch fire.Roberts consults his pal, Will Giddings (Normann Burton), and the two confront Jim Duncan about the wiring; Duncan's chief electrical engineer is his son-in-law, Roger Simmons (Richard Chamberlain), and to all three men's chagrin Simmons cannot be reached by phone. While Will Giddings works with the building's chief security officer, Harry Jernigan (O.J. Simpson), on the electrical systems, Doug Roberts tracks down Roger Simmons and his wife Patty (Susan Blakley), and confronts Simmons about the wiring. Simmons, a thoroughly oily man, insists the wiring is up to city safety codes, but those codes are not sufficient for an 1,800-foot skyscraper. Simmons nonetheless blows off Doug, which agitates Patty as she doesn't want her father's business to suffer because of him.The dedication ceremony goes off as scheduled and the entire building is lit up for the party in the Promenade Room some 135 floors up. Doug and Will miss the party as they examine more wiring, and find it to be in worse shape than they could have imagined. Roberts gruffly orders the main utility room to shut off the power overload (in the process overruling Jim Duncan), then he and Will head to the 81st floor to check relay systems - just as security cameras detect smoke from that floor's storage closet and Harry Jernigan has the fire department called. He proceeds to 81, but before he arrives Doug, Will, and other executives spot the smoke and the fire erupts into the hallway, engulfing Will Giddings. Doug and the others smother Giddings in drapes while one man grabs a fire hose and begins spraying the flaming storage closet. Jernigan arrives and orders Doug to call an ambulance and also to call Jim Duncan and evacuate the Promenade Room while he helps get Giddings to the ground floor. But when Doug calls Duncan, Duncan insists the fire won't spread, and insists that Doug attend the ceremony.The fire department now arrives in force with Battalion Chief Mike O'Halloran (Steve McQueen), who has a distaste for architects because they insist on building skyscrapers even though the department can't easily fight a fire above seven floors. Despite this antagonism, Roberts and O'Halloran work together as the department sets up a forward command two floors below the fire. O'Halloran quietly goes to the Promenade Room and confronts Jim Duncan to evacuate the area, and Duncan reluctantly proceeds. But a gas line ruptures and explodes, detonating more fires around the building and reaching the main elevator banks - and catching a crowd of partiers taking the elevator down only for the elevator to stop on the fire floor and the blaze to engulf them.While evacuating the party guests into the elevators, Senator Parker suggests to Duncan that it will take a great deal of time to evacuate using this method, and suggests ""those with stout hearts and trim waistlines"" use the stairs. They try the first exit, but immediately find smoke when they open the door. They then try the other door, but it appears stuck. They enlist the aid of Carlos, the head bartender, but the three men are unable to find a way to open the fire door.One of the partiers, painter Lisolette Mueller (Jennifer Jones), being entertained by shady businessman Harlee Claiborne (Fred Astair), doesn't evacuate the building; she instead rushes to the 87th floor where a deaf woman, Mrs. Allbright, lives with her two children, who are students of hers. When security cameras spot Mueller, Harry Jernigan and Doug rush to the 87th floor to rescue the Allbrights. Jernigan rescues Mrs. Allbright, but the fire cuts off her two children and Lisolette Mueller, and when a gas line explodes on the stairway, Doug, Mueller, and the Allbright children must trek up 47 floors to the Promenade Room, in the process surviving a gas explosion that shatters the stairway. They eventually arrive on the 135th floor but now must find a way through a fire door sealed shut by construction cement left over from the week.When word of the sealed door reaches the fire department, two firefighters laboriously trek up to the 135th floor and succeed in blowing open the door, but the stairway below has been destroyed, and with the power failing, the best hope to evacuate the Promenade Room now is helicopter landing on the rooftop helipad - which disintegrates when several panicking partiers rush to the chopper and it has to swerve out of the way and promptly crashes. Now the only hope is to set up a breeches buoy from a building a block away. Doug, however, activates a gravity brake on the outside elevator, so twelve people - the women who were to be carried out on the helicopter, plus the Allbright children, Lisolette Mueller, and one of the two firemen - can at least get to the ground. This, however, goes wrong when more explosions tear the elevator off its track and throws Lisolette Mueller into a fatal fall, forcing O'Halloran to lead a laborious effort with a helicopter to wrench the elevator from its track and place it on the ground with the survivors.After hours of work, the fire reaches critical mass, and O'Halloran is given the grim truth - the only hope left is to explode the building's water tanks on the roof,as they hold one million gallons of water and blowing the tanks is the last hope of extinguishing the fire. This option, however, may kill the remaining partiers trapped on the Tower. O'Halloran explains the plan to Roberts, and while Roberts is explaining it to the remaining trapped guests, the fire makes itself visible.Simmons leads a pack of followers in a takeover of the breeches buoy. He gets in, and Senator Parker attempts to drag him out and restore order so the appropriate people can go. The weight of Parker, Simmons, and several other men carry the breeches buoy out of the window. Simmons pushes Senator Parker and several other men hanging on the breeches buoy to their deaths 135 floors down. Simmons' victory is short-lived, as the rope to the breeches buoy parts, and Simmons falls to his death as well.O'Halloran is helicoptered to the roof. Once there he and Roberts set to work planting explosive charges, then secure themselves with the remaining partiers in the Promenade Room for the fateful vigil before the explosion and ensuing flood. The fire is put out, with the cost of some who aren't securely tied down.Harlee is informed that Lisolette didn't make it, and in grieving disbelief he impotently yells out here name; Jernigan finds him and gives him her cat, Elke, whom he holds, tearing up both in grief and in shame at himself. Patty is also grief-stricken by the death of Simmons. Reunited with Susan, Doug feels the glass Tower should be left shutdown as a ""shrine to all the bullshit in the world"". He also accepts O'Halloran's bitter comment about architects and the need for them to consult the fire department on how to build skyscrapers."

tt0072431,"['Comedy', 'contentRating', 'PG']","Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) is a lecturing physician at an American medical school and engaged to the tightly wound socialite Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn). He becomes exasperated when anyone brings up the subject of his grandfather Victor Frankenstein, the infamous mad scientist; to dissociate himself from his forebear, Frederick insists that his surname is pronounced: ""fraunk-en-stein"". When a solicitor informs him that he has inherited his family's estate in Transylvania after the death of his great-grandfather, the Baron Beaufort von Frankenstein, Frederick travels to Europe to inspect the property. At the Transylvania train station, he is met by a hunchbacked, bug-eyed servant named Igor (Marty Feldman), and a lovely young personal assistant named Inga (Teri Garr).Upon arrival at the estate, Frederick meets the forbidding housekeeper Frau Blücher (Cloris Leachman), whose name makes the horses of the nearby stables nay and tremble (a running joke used throughout the film). Upon discovering the secret entrance to his grandfather's laboratory and reading his private journals, Frederick is so captivated that he decides to resume his grandfather's experiments in re-animating the dead. He and Igor steal the corpse of a recently executed criminal, and Frederick sets to work experimenting on the large corpse. Matters go awry when Igor is sent to steal the brain of a deceased revered historian, Hans Delbrück; startled by lightning, he drops and ruins Delbrück's brain. Taking a second brain, Igor returns with a brain labeled ""Do Not Use This Brain! Abnormal"", which Frederick unknowingly transplants into the corpse.Soon, Frederick is ready to re-animate his creature (Peter Boyle), who is eventually brought to life by electrical charges during a lightning storm. The creature makes its first halting steps, but, frightened by Igor lighting a match, he attacks Frederick and must be sedated. Meanwhile, the townspeople are uneasy at the possibility of Frederick continuing his grandfather's work, unaware of the creature's existence; most concerned is Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars), a one-eyed police official with a prosthetic arm and a thick German accent. Kemp visits the doctor and subsequently demands assurance that he will not create another monster. Upon returning to the lab, Frederick discovers Blücher setting the creature free. After she reveals the monster's love of violin music and her own romantic relationship with Frederick's grandfather, the creature is enraged by sparks from a thrown switch and escapes from the Frankenstein castle.While roaming the countryside, the monster has frustrating encounters with a young girl and a blind hermit (Gene Hackman). Frederick recaptures the monster and locks the two of them in a room, where he calms the monster's homicidal tendencies with flattery and fully acknowledges his own heritage, shouting out emphatically, ""My name is Frankenstein!"". Frederick offers the sight of ""The Creature"" following simple commands to a theater full of illustrious guests. The demonstration continues with Frederick and the monster launching into the musical number ""Puttin' On the Ritz"". However, the routine ends disastrously when a stage light explodes and frightens the monster, who becomes enraged and charges into the audience, where he is captured and chained by police. Back in the laboratory, Inga attempts to comfort Frederick and the two wind-up sleeping together on the suspended reanimation table.The monster escapes when Frederick's fiancee Elizabeth arrives unexpectedly for a visit, taking Elizabeth captive as he flees. Elizabeth falls in love with the creature due to his inhuman stamina and his enormous penis (referred to as Schwanstücker or Schwanzstück). The townspeople hunt for the monster. Desperate to get the creature back, Frederick plays the violin to lure his creation back to the castle and recaptures him. Just as the Kemp-led mob storms the laboratory, Frankenstein transfers some of his stabilizing intellect to the creature who, as a result, is able to speak for the first time and reason with and placate the mob. Elizabeth marries the now erudite and sophisticated monster with her hair styled identically to that of the female creature from the Bride of Frankenstein, while Inga joyfully learns what her new husband Frederick got in return during the transfer procedure the monster's Schwanzstücker."

tt0072684,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'History', 'War']","PART I: By what means Redmond Barry acquired the style and title of Barry Lyndon.In the opening scene, set in 1750s Ireland, the father of Irishman Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) is killed in a duel by a businessman over a disputed sale of some horses. This detail is related by the film's narrator (the voice of Michael Horden), who comments ironically on the events that transpire. The widow (Marie Kean), disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to the raising of her son.While still in his teens, Barry falls in love with his older cousin, Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton). A wealthy English army officer named Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter) meets and begins courting Nora, leading the jealous Barry to challenge Quin to a duel. Barry's second in the duel is his older friend, Captain Jack Grogan (Godfrey Quigley), and also present are Barry's cousins, Ulick and Mick Brady. They fire pistols at ten paces. When Barry's gunfire knocks Quin flat, the Brady cousins pronounce him dead and urge Barry to flee to avoid a murder charge. Believing that he has killed Quin and will be arrested by the British for murder, Barry flees.On the road to Dublin, Barry is robbed and his horse stolen by a middle-aged highwayman (Arthur O'Sullivan) and the man's son. Penniless, Barry enlists in the British army and finds himself in boot camp. During training, Barry gets into a brawl with a local bully named O'Toole (Pat Roach), and is forced to fight bare-knuckle against the guy. Barry wins the fight by dodging all of O'Toole's blows and knocks out his opponent, which earns him popularity from the rest of his fellow recruits.After basic training, Barry and his unit are sent to France to fight in the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) between the alliance of Great Britain and Prussia and the alliance of France, Austria and Russia. While still in a training camp, Barry is reunited with his old friend, Captain Grogan. One evening in the privacy of Grogan's tent, he tells Barry that Captain Quin is not dead after all and has married Nora. The whole duel was a ploy by Nora's relatives to make Barry flee from Ireland so she can marry Quin.During Barry's first ""taste of conflict"" during a skirmish on August 1, 1759 at the Battle of Minden, Grogan is killed, along with many other British soldiers, during the battle with a French rearguard. Over the next year-and-a-half, Barry becomes fed up with the brutality of war. One day, Barry takes an opportunity when he is able to steal the uniform and horse of Lt. Jonathan Fakenham, an army dispatcher, while Frakenham is bathing in a nearby stream with his gay lover.Posing as a British officer, Barry travels through the allied German states along the Rhine, hoping to get to neutral Holland and from there hopefully get back to Ireland. Barry has a brief affair with a local German woman (Diana Koerner) whom he shacks up with while her husband is away at war.Later, while traveling up the Rhine River to the north on horseback, Barry meets a Prussian officer, Captain Potzdorf (Hardy Kruger), who quickly sees through his disguise. Given the choice of joining the Prussian army or being turned back over to the British where he will no doubt be executed as a deserter, Barry enlists in his second army. After Barry saves Potzdorf's life by dragging him out of a burning house during a battle with French troops, Barry is promoted and receives a special commendation from the Prussian king, Frederick the Great.Two years later, after the war ends in 1763, Barry is employed by the Prussian Minister of Police, Potzdorf's uncle. It is arranged for him to become the servant of the Chevalier de Balibari (Patrick Magee), a professional gambler. The Prussians suspect that he is a spy and Barry is assigned to try to determine if he is. However, Barry discovers that the Chevalier is an expatriate Irishman like himself. After an attack of conscience, Barry immediately confesses his mission to the Chevalier and becomes his protege while continuing his charade of spying on him for Potzdor. Barry assists the Chevalier in cheating at card games, but when the Prince of Tübingen (Wolf Kahler) suspects the truth after losing a large sum of money, Potzdorf decides to expel the Chevalier from the country. Barry relays this to the Chevalier who persuades Barry to take advantage of this to flee Prussia. The Chevalier flees from his house during the night and crosses the border. The next day, Barry impersonates the Chevalier by donning his wig and clothes, so when Potzdorf arrives to take him to the border of Prussia and Saxony, Barry rejoins the Chevalier, both free at last.Over the next several years, Barry and the Chevalier become successful gamblers as they travel through Europe and gain access to high society. They wander from place to place, cheating the nobles at card games. Barry proves to be very useful; when a loser refuses to pay his debts, Barry's excellent swordsmanship, which he learned during his military service, convinces him otherwise. Seeing that his life of being a drifter and gambler is going nowhere, Barry decides to marry into wealth. Some time later, at a gambling table in Spa, Belgium, he encounters the beautiful and wealthy Countess of Lyndon (Marisa Berenson). After Barry has an argument with Lady Lyndon's aged and terminally sick husband (Frank Middlemass), he suffers a heart attack and dies.PART II: Containing an account of the misfortunes and disasters which befell Barry Lyndon.The following year (on June 15, 1773), Lady Lyndon and Barry are married and Barry takes her last name of Lyndon and settles in England with wealth at last. The Chevalier is the best man at Barry's wedding and afterwords, he wishes Barry luck with his new life and goes off on his own. Young Lord Bullingdon (Dominic Savage), Lady Lyndon's 10-year-old son by Sir Charles, hates Barry from the beginning, knowing that Barry is an adventurer and ""common opportunist"" and is not in love with his mother.In this second part, Barry undergoes a character transformation from being ambitious, naive and innocent, into a self-destructive and arrogant man who becomes corrupted by his newly acquired wealth and power. The marriage between Barry and Lady Lyndon is not a happy one, although they welcome a new son born the following year, whom they name Bryan Patrick. Barry is unfaithful to her, and expends most of Lady Lyndon's fortune in an effort to ingratiate himself with those who could assist him in his quest to become a peer of the realm while keeping his wife and children in dull seclusion. One day, she observes Barry consorting with her maid and feels humiliated, but when Barry approaches her in her bath to apologize, she forgives him. However, young Bullingdon does not forgive Barry, and when he reminds Lady Lyndon that Sir Charles is his true father, Barry takes him out of the room to horsewhip him.As the years pass, Barry dotes on the sweet-natured Bryan, while Bullingdon's hatred intensifies. Barry brings his mother over from Ireland to live with him on the estate grounds. After meeting with Lady Lyndon as well as her son Lord Bullingdon (now a teenager played by Leon Vitali), Barry's mother privately warns her son that his position is precarious. If Lady Lyndon were to die, all of her wealth would go to her first-born son Lord Bullingdon; Barry and his son Bryan would be left penniless. Barry's mother advises him to obtain a noble title to protect himself. Following his mother's advice, Barry cultivates the acquaintance of the influential Lord Wendover (André Morell) with this goal in mind, spending much money to grease his way to the top of the social ladder. Barry gains access to more of high society and even once meets with the British king George III at a reception in London. To that end, Barry discusses the issue with former government minister, Lord Hallam, who refers him to Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Wendover. The Earl, making no promises, is willing to consider backing Barry, but says that there must be no question of his worthiness. Barry spends more money lavishly to buy lands and expensive pictures, to entertain those most likely to advance him and make bribes in high places. One day in the boys' schoolroom, when Bullingdon and the usually congenial Bryan quarrel, Barry whips Bullingdon. The viscount, now grown, threatens that next time he will kill Barry.One day during a lavish birthday party for Lady Lyndon that Barry holds in her honor, Lord Bullingdon crashes the party and announces his hatred of his stepfather. Bullingdon vows to leave his home and never return as long as his mother is married to Redmond Barry whom he continues to badmouth as a ""Irish underling"". The hot-tempered Barry physically attacks Lord Bullingdon and beats him up in front of all of the important guests which puts a quick end to the party. Humiliated by this public brawl, Bullingdon never the less makes good on his word and leaves the family estate and England itself for parts unknown. However, Barry's public cruelty towards his unruly stepson loses him all the powerful friends he has worked so hard to make and he is shunned socially. From then on, Barry is considered an outcast by good society, although they do not admit this to his face. At once, his bills become due and are paid by Lady Lyndon's income.In contrast to the mistreatment he gave Lord Bullingdon, Barry proves to be a doting and compassionate father to Bryan. Barry now focuses all his attention on raising his son Bryan. Over the next year-and-a-half, Barry cannot refuse the young boy anything and spoils him every chance he gets, giving Bryan everything that he never had as a young child growing up in poverty in Ireland. Barry even purchases a pony for Bryan to ride despite the fact that the young boy is not a good enough rider. Bryan says that all he wants is a horse (not a pony), so he can go hunting with his father. However, on Bryan's 9th birthday, despite his parents stern orders not to ride his new horse without the company of his parents, the spoiled and rotten boy disobeys them anyway and is thrown while riding from his horse and dies three days later from a head injury.The grief-stricken Barry turns to drink and isolates himself even further, while Lady Lyndon seeks solace in religion, assisted by the Reverend Samuel Runt (Murray Melvin), tutor first to Lord Bullingdon and then to Bryan. Mrs. Barry takes over the management of Castle Hackton. After a few weeks, Mrs. Barry dismisses Reverend Runt partly because they no longer need a tutor (mostly because of Barry's past spending habits), partly for what she says is fear that his influence is making Lady Lyndon worse. Plunging even deeper into grief, she attempts suicide by taking poison, but survives and is taken to a nearby clinic to recover. The Reverend and the family's accountant and emissary Graham (Philip Stone) then seek out Lord Bullingdon. Upon hearing of these events, Lord Bullingdon returns to England where he finds Barry drunk in a gentleman's club, mourning the loss of his son rather than being with Lady Lyndon. Bullingdon demands satisfaction for Barry's public assault by challenging him to a duel.The duel with pistols is held in a tithe barn. A coin-toss gives Bullingdon the right of first fire, but he nervously misfires his pistol as he prepares to shoot. Barry, reluctant to shoot Bullingdon, magnanimously fires into the ground, but the unmoved Bullingdon refuses to let the duel end, claiming he has not received ""satisfaction"". In the second round, Bullingdon shoots Barry in his left leg. At a nearby inn, a surgeon informs Barry that the leg will need to be amputated below the knee if he is to survive.While Barry is recovering, Bullingdon re-takes control of the Lyndon estate. A few days later, Bullingdon sends a very nervous Graham to the cottage where Barry is recovering to offer him a deal: Bullingdon will grant Barry a small annuity of 500 guineas for life if he leaves England forever and ends his marriage to Lady Lyndon; otherwise, with his credit and bank accounts exhausted, his creditors will see to it that he is put in jail. Wounded in spirit and body and with no friends left, Barry reluctantly accepts the deal. Barry goes back to Ireland with his mother to recover from his injuries. He is then said to have gone back to the European continent to resume his former profession of gambler, though without his former success. From there, history loses touch with Redmond Barry's life after that. He never sees Lady Lyndon again.In the final scene, set another few years later in December 1789, a gray and middle-aged Lady Lyndon is going over her finances with Lord Bullingdon, Reverend Runt and Graham. She then pauses to sign Barry's annuity cheque to be sent to Ireland. Bullingdon looks over at her sorrowful face and comes to realize that she indeed loved Redmond Barry despite his faults. Mother and son say nothing to each other and continue to review their financial papers.EPILOGUE: ""It was in the reign of George III that the aforesaid personages lived and quarreled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now."""
tt0072709,"['Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Mystery', 'SciFi']","After enjoying critical and commercial successes with Murmur of the Heart and Lacombe, Lucien, Malle decided to go for something much more experimental and free-form. Always a great fan of myth and fantasy, and especially of the work of Lewis Carroll, Malle tries to create the special, charged atmosphere of a world in which actions, objects and creatures are never quite what they seem. The film begins when the teenaged Lily (Harrison) has a road accident and discovers she's landed smack in the middle of some kind of civil war. Fleeing into a nearby field, she comes upon a lonely mansion inhabited by an old lady (Giehse) who knows how to talk to animals. Shot by the great Sven Nykvist, Black Moon offers a distinctively different approach to the theme of adolescent self-realization that has been a frequent concern in Malle's work."
tt0072730,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'SciFi', 'Thriller']","Opening: World War IV lasted five days.In the post-apocalyptic world of 2024, rover Vic (Don Johnson) hears a voice from his dog and communicates with him telepathically. The dog is called Blood (voiced by Tim McIntire). Vic is an 18-year-old boy who was born in and scavenging throughout the desert wasteland of the former southwestern United States. Vic is most concerned with food and sex; having lost both of his parents. He has no formal education and does not understand ethics or morality. He is accompanied by a well-read, misanthropic, telepathic dog named Blood who helps him locate women in return for food. The two steal for a living, evading bands of marauders, berserk androids, and mutants. Blood and Vic have an occasionally antagonistic relationship (Blood frequently annoys Vic by calling him ""Albert"" for reasons never made clear), though they realize they need each other.As they travel, Blood recounts history and quizzes Vic on various topics in history including the four world wars, from World War I (1914-1918), World War II (1939-1945), World War III (1950-1983), which were a series of wars, also called the Cold War, between the free and un-free world (Korea, Vietnam, Indochina, Congo were among them), to World War IV, also called the Five-Day War, or the Nuclear War of 2007. The setting is what was once the ruins in and around Phoenix, Arizona. The area is a desert wasteland, populated by marauders and rovers who battle for food found in the tops of buildings that was once ""civilization"" where the desert sands have consumed most of the buildings. There are rumors that what civilization exists now is below ground for the past several years since the nuclear war. The people of these underground civilizations are called ""downunders"". Neither Vic nor Blood want to venture below to live. Blood finds women for Vic to rape, and Vic supplies Blood with food since he cannot hunt on his own.We learn Blood is a former police dog, and wants to find the ""promised land"" where farming is possible and several above-ground utopias are said to exist. Vic believes that they must make the best of what they have.Blood sniffs out a woman, but rovers have reached her first and have killed her after gang raping her. Vic begins to argue with Blood about his inability to find women. Blood wants to go ""over the hill"" to paradise. Vic promises that they'll go once Blood finds him another woman for Vic to have sex with.Some time later, Vic and Blood view a small group of scavengers, led by a brutal gang leader, a self-proclaimed ""king"" named Fellini (Ron Feinberg), who orders his group to dig up a stash of crates containing canned food. Temped by the food, Vic runs forward when Fellini and his men are all in the hole digging and steals some of the bags of canned food, shooting a few of Fellini's men who chase after him. However, Fellini orders his men to let Vic go, impressed by the young man's courage and ability. As Vic and Blood run away, they are watched from a distance by a small group of mysterious men (unseen from the waist up), where one of whom comments that he just might do. They decide to ""put out the cheese"" to trap Vic.That evening, Vic and Blood go to an outdoor makeshift movie theater in a shantytown camp to watch some vintage stag films, and Blood smells a female. She is in attendance at the stag film, but in disguise as a male solo. Vic follows the girl to an underground building which is an abandoned YMCA, and he watches her change out of her clothing into a woman's dress. He attacks her and orders her to undress so he can rape her. While she undresses for him, she tells him her name is Quilla June Holmes (Susanne Benton). Blood interrupts them to advise of marauders nearby. Quilla realizes Blood can talk to Vic telepathically. She attempts to communicate with the dog, but Blood just barks at her. Meanwhile, Vic ambushes the marauders and Blood joins in, killing some of them. Vic imitates the ""screamers"" (radiation victims) and Blood battles another dog. Vic is about to be shot from behind, and Quilla saves him. The rest of the marauders run off, but Blood is hurt. Then, the real screamers show up, forcing Vic and Quilla to hide and wait in a storage tank. Vic and Quilla make love repeatedly.Later when morning arrives, Blood goes off to see if the screamers have left, and Quilla tries to convince Vic to go ""down under"". Blood wants Vic to leave her, and they argue. When Vic goes back to see Quilla, she knocks him out and flees. Vic decides to track her down, but Blood thinks (rightly) that it's a trap. After following Quilla's footprints through the desert, Vic and Blood come across a small steel obstacle standing in the middle of the desert which leads ""down under"". Using a key card that Quilla left behind, Vic uses it to open the steel door to the underground. Vic goes down under, leaving Blood alone and injured on the surface.Vic climbs down several long ladders through what appears to be an abandoned missile silo, past mysterious machinery, then opens a metal door to find an underground cemetery. He is captured and washed by a clown-faced man dressed in farmer's garb called Michael (Hal Baylor) with several strangers looking on in what appears to be a firehouse.After given clean farmer clothes, Vic is dragged by Michael through a local park, walking past picnickers, giggling young girls, a marching band playing 'Stars and Stripes Forever', and a singing barbershop quartet... all wearing semi-hideous, white clown-face makeup. The population of this underground community apparently wears white clown-faces to distinguish themselves from above-grounders that dare to trespass in their community. Loudspeakers are everywhere, constantly blaring announcements, pontificate morals for daily living, and down home cooking recipes. What we get is a glimpse of is a surreal, bizarre, re-creation of life in the rural Midwest during the early 20th century with a populace of robotic conformists. Vic stops to talk to a small dog similar to Blood. We do not hear the short telepathic conversation between Vic and the other dog, but the dog apparently says something to Vic which makes his happy facial demeanor turn worried and sour. Just then, Michael forcibly takes Vic and the other dog away.In a church/town hall building, residents may attend the weekly ""awards and punishments"" at their own discretion. This down-under community is led by ruthless triumvirate-type of government known as the Committee. The three clownish-looking, but cold-hearted, rulers of this underground town include Lou Craddock (Jason Robards) who reviews blueprints for buildings to be built and harshly passes judgments on transgressors, assisted by his secretary Mez Smith (Helene Winston) and his business partner Doctor Moore (Alvy Moore). Severe judgment (death) is called ""farming out"" or ""going to 3"". We learn the underground town is called Topeka. Quilla arrives, and she asks to be put on the Committee having served her purpose of luring Vic to their underground community. Lou (revealed to be Quilla's stepfather) refuses by claiming that she is too young to rule and arranges for her to get married instead. Quilla leaves and vents her anger to her boyfriend Gary (Michael Rupert) and makes plans to overthrow the ruthless committee, but in the meantime be a good girl and play it safe. At the same time, the dog is brought into the church where he is interrogated by Lou and Doctor Moore asking if he told Vic anything. But when the dog does not respond, Lou angrily orders the dog to be sent to the farm.Vic is brought before Lou, and Doctor Moore reads his medical statistics. Lou tells the unruly Vic that he and the Topeka Committee have been watching him on the surface for days now, and that Vic has been chosen to help re-populate Topeka, as its male residents are sterile and/or impotent due to their ridiculously wholesome, clean, and subterranean living. Vic laughs hysterically, thinking he'll get to sleep with dozens of women. The sinister Topeka Committee laughs back... where Mez Smith hysterically indicates to Vic that sleeping with dozens of women is not what they have in mind.In the next scene, a couple is married in a hospital room, and Vic is in attendance (strapped to a gurney) to provide semen. Quilla arrives and rescues him, subduing the doctors. She tells him he is only going to be allowed to impregnate 35 girls, then will be put to death. They rush out of the hospital with the help of Gary, and find Vic's guns in the church, then Vic starts to leave. Quilla tries to stop him to help her overthrow the dictatorship of Topeka, but Vic has no interest in politics and wants to return to the surface to his dog Blood where he feels at home.The Committee convenes at the town square and begins broadcasting the sentence on Quilla and her friends - the farm. Gary and both of his rebel friends are attacked and killed by Michael who literally crushes their heads with his bare hands. Vic fires at Michael, but the bullets have no effect. One of Vic's gunshots finally disables ""Michael"", who is revealed to be a robot. Vic and Quilla flee while the Committee remains indifferent and begins planning for its next ""donor"". Lou also orders that another Michael security robot be exhumed from the storage warehouse, with his clownish smile wiped off.Vic and Quilla return to the surface where it is now night. Relieved that the Topeka citizens are not chasing after them, they look around and they find Blood nearby, who is dying. But conditions on the surface have become worse with after Blood tells Vic that Fellini and his gang have taken over for the most part. Blood hasn't eaten for days and will die soon unless Vic provides him with food. Quilla tells Vic that it's too late to save Blood and that Vic should come away with her far away if he really loves her. Vic must choose... he looks at Blood, then looks back at Quilla...In the final shot, Vic and Blood are putting out a campfire near the steel dome. Having eaten, Blood feels better and he and Vic (still barefoot and wearing his hospital scrubs) walk away from their campfire into the sunrise of dawn. Quilla is nowhere to be seen, but torn pieces of her white wedding gown are seen strewn around the dying campfire. Vic and Blood talk about how Vic was touched by the fact that Quilla June picked him to be with instead of the dictatorship Committee of Topeka. Blood remarks, ""She had marvelous judgment... if not a particularly good taste (!)"" The boy and his dog laugh at the pun and they both walk away ""over the hill"" toward paradise."

tt0072771,['Comedy'],"Costante Nicosia (Lando Buzzanca) is a boorish, irascible, man having married for wealth. He is the new boss of a recently inherited toothpaste factory and the owner of a local Rome basketball team which the film opens during a game. ""The only reason I own this bunch of dippy dribblers is to push toothpaste to those sports nuts out there,"" says Nicosia to his hunchbacked side-kick Peppino (Antonio Aliocca). He is also extremely superstitious. Peppino is less of a friend than a good luck charm as far as the insensitive Nicosia is concerned. He believes that it brings good luck to rub a hunchback's hump so that his basketball team will win the game.The signs and omens are all against this wealthy rat: a black cat crosses his path, and worst still he breaks a mirror in his apartment. Superstition demands that he persuade a virgin to urinate over the broken shards of glass in order to halt the tide of bad luck. Abusively, he passes a decrepit old spinster who lives next door to him mistakenly assuming that she has never done the deed. Nicosias relationship with his wife Mariu (Sylva Koscina) is scarcely more convivial for he states to her, ""I always have good luck with things that rhyme with the letter U, except you!""Reluctantly bowing to family pressure, Nicosia employs his loafing brother-in-law into a menial post at the factory. But he fires him the following day after catching the man asleep on the job, snoring loudly. That evening at a family gathering at his apartment, he is accosted by his ungrateful in-laws who try to shame him into giving the feckless mans his job back. Instead of acquiescing to family practice, he bursts into an escalating tirade of rudeness against the singers figure of his Great Aunt Maria (Grazia Spadaro). The old woman finally responds to his cynical remarks by uttering a curse. Nicosia spits with derision at first, that is until the old hag threatens of pour oil onto the floor; this heavy duty bit of magical business breaks Nicosia's nerve, and he recants in a babbling panic. But its too late as Nicosia grovels for the curse to be lifted, and the old woman has the last laugh.A few days later, Nicosia is on a plane to Bucharest, Romania where he expects to attend a business conference. A tall, gaunt, suave man seated nearby introduces himself as Count Dragalescu (John Steiner), and after some small talk, he invites the troubled industrialist to visit him at his castle while in the region. Upon arriving at the hotel, Nicosia discovers that the conference has been postponed, leaving him stranded at the hotel for the entire weekend. Another businessman, named Meniconi (Franco Nebbia), tells him that there are no prostitutes to be had in the region, and that he has failed to seduce any of the local women, even after buying sexy lingerie to bribe them. He confides to Nicosia that he has taken to wearing the lingerie, brand name: 'Hot Night in Havana' himself.Rather the spend the weekend in this wretched resort, Nicosia decides to call on the Count. Upon arriving in a taxi, Nicosia sees that the castle is very much what one would expect from a Romanian nobleman's abode, complete with lighting and thunder to amplify the Gothic effect. Count Dragalescu greets his guest in the cavernous dining hall. Suddenly, a gay bunch of revelers stagger down the large staircase into the dining hall. The Count introduces his companions (three women and a man) to the wary guest. The women greet Nicosia in a lavish, tactile manner. When Boris, the screaming camp male of the party, tries to greet Nicosia too, he backs up nervously away and declines.Laughing, the Count sends Nicosia up to his room to prepare for dinner. When Nicosia later comes back down the stairs, well dressed in a tuxedo, he finds himself overdressed for the occasion. ""Dinner in Transylvania's always in the nude!"" purrs Dragalescu. The evening gets even more debauched when Nicosia has a little too much to drink, strips off too, cavorts with some of the assembled throng, and then passed out cold. The next morning, he wakes up in his bed with the mirthfully grinning Dragalescu to his side. Running away half-dressed and in horror from the castle, Nicosia catches the first plane back to Italy.Back at his little toothpaste empire, Nicosia is rather tense and uptight. He greets all his employees with who speak to him with a clenched, furious, ""Up yours! Up yours!"" While overseeing his basketball team at practice, he is knocked off balance when the coach tells the team, ""you've got the big one!"" Nicosia repeats the phrase ""big one"" over and over, and then collapses in the locker room when he sees a row of naked men's bottoms in the showers. Nicosia goes to his physician Dr. Paluzzi (Rossano Brazzi) who suggests that he try making out with his mistress, and if he can't do that, the doctor adds that he must have been ""deflowered while drunk."" This attempt to re-establish his heterosexuality fails, however because the tormented Nicosia feels compelled to bite her with and suck blood out of her neck.Even more stricken, first with anxiety and then with abject self-pity, Nicosia calls on Great Aunt Maria to beg her to remove the curse, which he assumes, is responsible for his misfortune of homosexuality and blood craving. However, she claims that she had nothing to do with his urge for blood. She recommends that he visit the Magician of Noto (Ciccio Ingrassia) in Sicily for help and he complies in desperation. Upon arriving at the Magician of Noto's residence, Nicosia clearly sees from the posture and tone of voice, the magician is clearly a fake. But Nicosia accepts his advice: the curse on him will be lifted only if he re-employs his brother-in-law. Nicosia leaves, where its revealed to the viewers that the whole thing was a deliberate stunt organized by his in-laws into tricking Nicosia into giving his brother-in-law's job back. Returning home far from being cured, he responds to his needy wife's sexual advances by plunging his fang-like teeth into her bare bottom during foreplay. All seems lost to the once arrogant entrepreneur.Over the next few months, Nicosia adopts a devil-may-care aggression; he re-fires his lazy brother-in-law, arranges to visit prostitutes to satisfy his urge to bite, and isolates himself from family and friends. Finally he satisfies his craving for blood by setting up a blood-bank at his factory-site and compelling all employees to attend. Just as he seems to have surrendered to total cynicism, his wife arrives at the factory with a baby, his newborn son that was conceived that night of their passion.In the final scene, Nicosia throws a party to celebrate his son's birth. Rejoicing at his proof of his potency, Nicosia throws off the shackles of his superstitious paranoia and goes to greet and hold his baby son.

Meanwhile, he disguises himself as the bungalow watchman to protect the old man's job. Sulekha finds out one day about the cover-up and is charmed on seeing Parimal's real personality. They both get married. Parimal loves playing pranks and is the antithesis of regular professors. Sulekha, on the other hand is in awe of her jijaji (brother-in-law) Raghavendra (Om Prakash). She considers her jijaji to be highly intellectual and looks upon him as her idol. Parimal develops an inferiority complex thanks to Sulekha's excessive praise of her jijaji and decides to prove that he is in no way a lesser mortal. Jijaji, meanwhile, has written a letter to Haripad bhaiyya (David Abraham Cheulkar) asking him to send a driver who can speak good Hindi because his present driver James D'costa (Keshto Mukherjee) uses improper dialect.

Parimal becomes Pyare Mohan Ilahabadi, a motor-mouth driver who pretends to hate the English language and so speaks only Hindi. So begins the comedy of errors, as Parimal and Sulekha play prank after prank on the unsuspecting jijaji.First they pretend that Sulekha is not happy with her new marriage, then they put across the impression that Sulekha is having an affair with Pyare Mohan, and if that was not enough, they get Parimal's long-time friend Sukumar Sinha (Amitabh Bachchan), a professor of English literature, to temporarily act as Parimal and portray him as a serious and boring lecturer, the complete opposite of Parimal's character. Pyare Mohan's excessively refined Hindi, his habit of correcting Jijaji's usage of the language and his persistence in getting jijaji to teach him English all serve to irk Jijaji to no end and provide for many laughs. Parimal's long-time friend P K Srivastava (Asrani) is also party to the prank. His sister-in-law Vasudha (Jaya Bachchan) suspects fake 'Parimal' - Sukumar Sinha - of infidelity to his wife 'Sulekha' when he tries to get close to her.

They instead go to the neighborhood diner, named Martha's which is owned and managed by a woman of the same name (Juanita McConnell), who also works as the head cook, where their classmates dance to jukebox music, snack and, in the back near the bathroom, gamble over a dice game. As soon as they arrive at Martha's, the pair learn from a classmate named Dorothy (Lynn Caridine) that their history exam has been moved to Monday, forcing them to study over the weekend.A little later when Cochise urges Preach to leave a dice game dominated by petty crooks Stone (Sherman Smith) and Robert (Norman Gibson), the young men are startled by attractive and unflappable schoolmate Brenda (Cynthia Davis), who demands to get through their game to reach the bathroom.

tt0072856,"['Action', 'Comedy', 'SciFi', 'Sport']","In the dystopian year of 2000, the United States has been destroyed by a financial crisis and a military coup. Political parties have collapsed into a single Bipartisan Party, which also fulfills the religious functions of a unified church and state. The resulting fascist police state, the United Provinces, is headed by the cult figure ""Mr. President"" (Sandy McCallum). The people are kept satisfied through a stream of gory gladiatorial entertainment, which includes the bloody spectacle of the Annual Transcontinental Road Race, depicted as a symbol of American values and way of life. The coast-to-coast, three-day race is run on public roads, and points are scored not just for speed, but for the number of innocent pedestrians struck and killed.Frankenstein (David Carradine) is the most celebrated racer and is the government's champion. He is reputed to be part machine, rebuilt after many crashes. He regularly battles with the other teams, particularly ""Machine Gun"" Joe Viterbo (Sylvester Stallone), who hates being second.The film is set at the start of the 20th annual race, during which a resistance group led by Thomasina Paine (Harriet Medin), a lineal descendant of Thomas Paine, one of the original American revolutionaries of the 1770s, is attempting to assassinate Frankenstein and replace him with one of their agents. The ""Resistance"" is assisted by Paine's great granddaughter Annie (Simone Griffeth), Frankenstein's navigator, who is intending to lure him into a planned ambush where he is to be replaced by a double. Disruption of the race by the Resistance is blamed on the French by the state, who are also blamed for ruining the country's economy and telephone system.It emerges that Frankenstein is not a willing government stooge, nor is there a single Frankenstein. The current Frankenstein is simply one of many people specially trained to race in the role. ""When one is used up, they bring in another,"" he tells Annie. The current Frankenstein also has his own plan to end the tyranny: win the race and shake hands with Mr. President, detonating a grenade which has been implanted in his prosthetic right hand (he refers to it as a ""hand grenade"".)Frankenstein successfully outmaneuvers both the rival drivers and the Resistance, and is declared the winner and sole survivor, although he is wounded and unable to carry out his original grenade attack plan (with Annie using the grenade to kill Joe Viterbo when he attacks them near the end of the race). Annie dons Frankenstein's disguise and plans to stab the President on the victory podium. Greeting the president as he congratulates Frankenstein (and declares war on the French), Annie is mistakenly shot and wounded by her grandmother. Frankenstein finally succeeds in killing the President by ramming the podium with his car.In an epilogue, Annie and Frankenstein are wed, and Frankenstein, now President, abolishes the race and the perverse laws of the Provinces, though he does make a point of running over objecting (and objectionable) reporter Junior Bruce (Don Steele) whom appears throughout the movie covering the race."
tt0072890,"['Biography', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","Based upon a real-life story that happened in the early seventies in which the Chase Manhattan Bank in Flatbush, Brooklyn, was held siege by a gay bank robber determined to steal enough money for his male lover to undergo a sex change operation. On a hot summer afternoon, the First Savings Bank of Brooklyn is held up by Sonny Wortzik and Sal two down-and-out characters. Although the bank manager and female tellers agree not to interfere with the robbery, Sonny finds that there's actually nothing much to steal, as most of the cash has been picked up for the day. Sonny then gets an unexpected phone call from Police Captain Eugene Moretti, who tells him the place is surrounded by the city's entire police force. Having few options under the circumstances, Sonny nervously bargains with Moretti, demanding safe escort to the airport and a plane out of the country in return for the bank employees' safety. Written by alfiehitchie First-time crook Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) and his friend Sal (John Cazale) rob a Brooklyn bank to fund Sonny's boyfriend's sex change operation, only to discover that the bank has very little money. Unsure what to do, the two robbers camp out in the bank, holding all the workers hostage. The police are alerted that there is a robbery in progress. Detective Eugene Moretti (Charles Durning) and numerous officers set up a siege around the bank. When Moretti calls the bank to tell the lead robber, Sonny, that the police have arrived, Sonny warns that he and his armed accomplice, Sal, have hostages and will kill them if anyone tries to come into the bank. Detective Moretti acts as hostage negotiator, while FBI Agent Sheldon (James Broderick) monitors his actions. Howard (John Marriott), the security guard, has an asthma attack, so Sonny releases him when Moretti asks for a hostage as a sign of good faith. Moretti convinces Sonny to step outside the bank to see how aggressive the police forces are. After a moment, Sonny starts his now-famous ""ATTICA!"" chant, and the civilian crowd starts cheering for Sonny.After realizing they cannot make a simple getaway, Sonny demands transportation: a jet to take them out of the country. When a tactical team approaches the back door, he fires a shot to warn them off. Moretti tries to persuade Sonny that those police were a separate unit that he was not controlling. Later, Sonny incites the crowd by throwing money over the police barricades. Some overrun the barricade and a few are arrested. When Sonny's wife Leon Schermer (a transwoman) (Chris Sarandon) arrives, she reveals that Sonny is robbing the bank to pay for Leon's sex reassignment surgery and that Sonny also has a legal wife, Angie, and children. Leon refuses to speak with Sonny, even over the telephone.As night sets in, the lights in the bank all shut off. Sonny goes outside again and discovers that Agent Sheldon has taken command of the scene. He refuses to give Sonny any more favors, but when hostage Mulvaney (Sully Boyar) goes into a diabetic shock, Agent Sheldon lets a doctor through. While the doctor is inside the bank, Sheldon convinces Leon to talk to Sonny on the phone. The two have a lengthy conversation that reveals Leon had attempted suicide to ""get away from"" Sonny. She had been hospitalized at the psychiatric ward of Bellevue Hospital until the police brought her to the scene. Leon turns down Sonny's offer to join him and Sal, to wherever they take the plane. Sonny tells police listening to the phone call that Leon had nothing to do with the robbery attempt.After the phone call, the doctor asks Sonny to let Mulvaney leave and Sonny agrees. Mulvaney refuses, instead insisting he remain with his employees. The FBI calls Sonny out of the bank again. They have brought his mother to the scene. She unsuccessfully tries to persuade him to give himself up and Agent Sheldon signals that a limousine will arrive in ten minutes to take them to a waiting jet. Once back inside the bank, Sonny writes out his will, leaving money from his life insurance to Leon for her sex change and to his wife Angie.When the limousine arrives, Sonny checks it for any hidden weapons or booby traps. When he decides the car is satisfactory, he settles on Agent Murphy to drive Sal, the remaining hostages and him to Kennedy Airport. Sonny sits in the front next to Murphy while Sal sits behind them. Murphy repeatedly asks Sal to point his gun at the roof so Sal won't accidentally shoot him. As they wait on the airport tarmac for the plane to taxi into position, Agent Sheldon forces Sonny's weapon onto the dashboard, creating a distraction which allows Murphy to pull a pistol hidden in his armrest and shoot Sal in the head. Sonny is immediately arrested and the hostages are all escorted to the terminal. The film ends with Sonny watching Sal's body being taken from the car on a stretcher."
tt0072901,"['Animation', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Fantasy']","After a group of legionaries is once again beaten up by the gauls, they imagine: ""With such huge strength, they can't be human... they must be gods"". Julius Caesar is informed, and laughs. He makes a decision with his council and goes to Armorica, to speak with Vitalstatistix. He gives the Gauls a series of 12 tasks, inspired by Hercules (but new ones, since the 12 Labours are outdated). Vitalstatistix assembles their best warriors, Asterix and Obelix, to do the job. The Roman Caius Tiddlus is sent along with them to guide them and check they complete each task.The Twelve Tasks:1. Run faster than Asbestos, champion of the Olympic Games. Asterix, helped by the magic potion, follows Asbestos until he runs so fast he becomes a rocket and exceeds the speed of sound, before hitting an apple tree. His nose swells up like a balloon and Obelix comments on how Gaulish it looks.2. Throw a javelin farther than Verses, the Persian. Verses' javelin hits North America (still only inhabited by Indians, including another Goscinny-Uderzo character, Oumpah-pah), but Obelix's javelin somehow enters a stable orbit and ends up pursuing Verses into the distance. As far as anyone can tell, he's still running from it.3. Beat Cilindric, the German. Cilindric turns out to be an unexpectedly diminutive man wearing a Judo gi but he quickly beats Obelix with a ""fighting technique he learnt in a distant land"". Asterix defeats Cilindric by tricking him into giving a lesson and asking for demonstrations that eventually end up with Cilindric's own arms and legs tied in knots.4. Cross a lake. The problem being that in the middle of the lake is the ""Isle of Pleasure"", a paradise inhabited by beautiful Sirens. Both Asterix and Obelix are enchanted and drawn to the island, but Obelix comes to his senses quickly after discovering that there are no wild boars on the island, has an incandescent argument with the Sirens, and storms off declaring that they can't call it the Isle of Pleasure if they don't serve wild boars, calling Asterix to follow him.5. Survive the hypnotic gaze of Iris, the Egyptian. Iris uses hypnosis to make his clients believe they are animals. He tries to make Asterix act to the phrase, ""I am a wild boar"", but when Asterix constantly breaks his concentration by not paying attention and saying ""You are a wild boar"" instead, Iris gets horribly confused and ends up hypnotising himself and bolting out of the building on all fours.6. Finish a meal by Mannekenpix, the Belgian. The chef is famous for cooking gigantic meals for the Titans - the task was to eat one of his massive three-course meals ""down to the last crumb"". Obelix devours a boar with fries, a flock of geese, several mutton, an omelette made with eight dozen eggs, a whole school of fish, an ox, a cow, veal (""because to separate ze family...zat would not be right!""), a huge mound of caviar (with a single piece of toast), a camel, (and before we start on the main course"") an elephant stuffed with olives. Later on the chef leaves the kitchen crying as everything in his kitchen was eaten, but a slightly disappointed Obelix believes that the huge meals were only appetisers.7. Survive the Cave of the Beast. In a distinctly abstract sequence of the film, the pair must enter a cave that no-one has ever emerged from alive - even Tiddlus has no idea what lurks within it. They encounter, among other sights, tennis played with a skull, bats, and a subway (on parisier stop of Alésia), before meeting the Beast. The lights suddenly go dark and the Beast is not shown on-screen. After they leave the cave, Tiddlus asks out of curiosity what the Beast was actually like - Obelix happily replies that it was ""very tasty"".8. Find Permit A 38 in ""The Place That Sends You Mad"". A mind-numbing multi-storey building founded on bureaucracy and staffed by clinically unhelpful people who direct all their clients to other similarly unhelpful people elsewhere in the building, which is also full of confusing corridors and steep stairs. Obelix goes nearly insane after some time but Asterix eventually beats them at their own game by asking for an imaginary permit in a corridor that nobody knows about, making the staff victims of their own unhelpfulness and sending the place into disarray. Eventually Asterix is given Permit A 38 just to make him leave and stop causing trouble.9. Cross a ravine on an invisible tightrope, over a river full of crocodiles. Eventually the heroic duo decide to give up on the rope and go the easy way round, jumping off and fighting the crocodiles, leaving the bemused creatures dangling on the invisible wire.10. Climb a mountain and answer the Old Man's riddle. After a tough climb of the snowbound peak, the Old Man of the Mountain's challenge is to determine, with eyes blindfolded, which pile of laundry was washed with Olympus, ""the detergent of the gods"". Asterix performs this task easily in a parody of washing detergent advertisements.11. Spend a night on the haunted plains. The plain, haunted by the ghosts of fallen Roman soldiers, is not an easy place to sleep. Obelix tries to fight them, but cannot harm ghosts. Asterix, woken by the commotion, furiously confronts the ghosts and they flee when they realise that the Gauls are not afraid of them.12. Survive the Circus. When the pair wakes up after a night on the plains, they find themselves in Rome, (""either that or these Romans have learnt to build very fast"") with their fellow villagers, who have been brought to fight in the Colosseum. After the gladiators are beaten (with the help of Getafix's potion, of course) the animals are sent in, and the Gauls turn the Circus into a modern day circus.After the Gauls succeed in every task, Caesar agrees that they are gods, gives them control of the Roman Empire, and retires to live with Cleopatra in a little house in the country. Caius Tiddlus takes his reward by retiring to the Isle of Pleasure."

tt0072962,"['Documentary', 'contentRating', 'PG']","Welles' take on filmmaking is as a form of trickery and fakery by editing different parts of other documentary footage on a famous forger Elmyr de Hory, being interviewed by the famous biographer of Howard Hughes, Clifford Irving. De Hory claimed that he never painted a picture by a famous artist, that he offered to a museum, that they didn't buy, and Irving was advanced $800,000 thousand dollars for an autobiography of the reclusive Howard Hughes which was completely false. Welles begins F for Fake by performing several magic tricks and claiming that filmmaking is prestidigitation and tricks the viewer into seeing something that the viewer willfully accepts. The filmmaker cites his own rise to stardom as a trickster by claiming that his first entrance on the scene was with a fake radio program about invasion from Mars. As the film follows De Hory and his development as a forger, it also follows Clifford Irving as a close associate of De Hory as evidence of how Orson Welles' formula for stardom reads, regardless of what the artist does with his art."

Risking a private meeting in his hotel room with long-time acquaintance police detective Lt. Nulty (John Ireland), Marlowe relates the events of the past several weeks:After Marlowe wraps up a missing teenager investigation, hulking ex-convict Moose Malloy (Jack O'Halloran), who has just completed a seven year stretch for a bank heist, asks the detective to locate his girlfriend, Velma Valento. While the men are walking down the street, shots are fired from a passing car at Malloy but Marlowe manages to push the larger man to the ground. Unperturbed, Malloy explains that he has not heard from Velma in six years and takes Marlowe to a downtown night club, called Florian's, where she used to work.At the club, Malloy demands to see the owner, Montgomery, but when the man tries to shoot him, Malloy kills him. After giving Marlowe $50 in cash to secure his services, Malloy slips away as Marlowe reports Montgomery's death to Nulty, insisting that the ex-con was killed only in self-defense.Upon learning that Tommy Ray (Walter McGinn), a former musician who played at Florian's, still lives across the street at the Crescent Hotel, Marlowe visits him. Ray, who is white, lives with his black wife and their young son, whom Marlowe befriends. Although Ray says he does not remember Velma, he directs Marlowe to Florian's widow, Jessie (Sylvia Miles), a faded club singer.The next day, Marlow drives over to Jessie's house, he brings Jessie a bottle of cheap bourbon, she reminisces about her days as a popular singer, then wonders why Tommy Ray would say he did not know Velma when he performed with her at the club.Marlowe then returns to the musician, who admits that he knew Velma. Armed with a photo of Velma provided by Ray, Marlowe questions several contacts in the burlesque trade. One club owner recalls that Velma, using another name, appeared in a couple of motion pictures, before breaking down and being placed in the Camarillo Sanitarium. Marlowe visits the sanitarium and finds the girl catatonic.Wondering how Malloy will take the news, Marlowe returns to his office where he finds Lindsay Marriott (John O'Leary) waiting for him. Marriott explains that a friend had an extremely rare jade necklace stolen and the thief has demanded $15,000 for its return. Marriott has agreed to make the exchange for his friend later that night and gives Marlowe a hundred dollars to accompany and protect him.That evening, Malloy confronts Marlowe in a restaurant but dismisses the detective's report on Velma being in a sanitarium. After asserting that Marlowe's picture is not of Velma, Malloy insists that the detective continue his search. Marlowe then goes back to the Crescent Hotel to talk to Ray to find out why he has lied to him, but the musician is not home.Later that same night, Marlowe meets Marriott and drives his car to the rendezvous. Standing a few feet away from the car, Marlowe is knocked unconscious and when he awakens, he is surrounded by Nulty and police officers who have found Marriott shot dead in the car. Nulty takes Marlowe into police headquarters where he and his partner, Billy Rolfe (Harry Dean Stanton), question him. Grudgingly accepting Marlowe's explanation, Nulty releases him and the detective immediately sets out to learn who killed Marriott and tried to frame him for the killing.Directed by a ""fence"" to an underground jewelry store in Chinatown, Marlowe discovers that the only person who can afford the rare jade is elderly city judge Baxter Wilson Grayle (Jim Thompson). Marlowe drives to Grayle's elegant mansion, where the judge informs Marlowe that his wife is not missing any jewelry. The detective meets the judge's sultry young trophy wife, Helen (Charlotte Rampling), who is wearing an elegant jade necklace. After Helen confides that she trusted Marriott and hopes that Marlowe can find his killer, she blatantly flirts with him in front of Grayle. Disconcerted, Marlowe departs.After returning to his office that evening, Marlowe is attacked and knocked out by Cowboy (Burton Gilliam), Jonnie (Sylvester Stallone) and Nick (Joe Spinell), three henchmen of the infamous madam Frances Amthor (Kate Murtaugh). At Amthor's bordello, Marlowe is drugged and questioned about Malloy's whereabouts to which he refuses to answer. After being beaten, Marlowe is placed in a back room where, upon rousing, he finds the dead body of Tommy Ray. After Cowboy arrives to take Marlowe to Amthor, the detective knocks him out, escapes and finds Amthor in her office where he demands an explanation for his abduction. Before Amthor can respond, however, they are interrupted by one of the prostitutes reporting that Amthor's favorite girl is in bed with Jonnie. Outraged, Amthor rushes to a nearby room, but when she begins to beat the girl, Jonnie shoots Amthor dead. In the ensuing mayhem, Marlowe, although still reeling from the effects of the drugs, staggers away.After recovering for the next several days in the apartment of friend and newspaper vendor Georgie (Jimmie Archie), Marlowe visits Mrs. Ray to relay the news of Tommy's death.That night, Helen telephones Marlowe at his office to invite him to a re-election party for her husband at the swank White Orchid club, owned by gambler gangster Laird Brunette (Anthony Zerbe). Meeting Helen at the party later, Marlowe learns that Grayle helped Brunette with a tax situation regarding his yacht and the men have remained on friendly terms. Familiar with Brunette from his days working in the district attorney's office, Marlowe joins Brunette at his table where the gambler gives him $2,000 to help him contact Malloy.The next day, Jessie Florian telephones Marlowe to relay that Velma has been in touch with her and wishes to speak with Malloy. Knowing that Brunette has ordered him followed to find out if he meets Malloy, Marlowe lays low for a few days, then, when contacted by Malloy, arranges with Jessie to have Velma telephone him at Georgie's apartment. Velma asks Malloy to meet her at a rundown motel out of town, but when Malloy and Marlowe arrive there, they are ambushed by two men with machine guns. After Marlowe kills the gunmen, Malloy refuses to accept that he has been set-up by Velma and departs.Marlowe then reports the murders to Nulty, who is angered that Marlowe has continued to keep him from questioning Malloy regarding the Florian's club murder. Hoping to glean more information from Jessie, Marlowe takes Nulty and Rolfe to her house, only to discover that she has been murdered.In the present, Marlowe reaches the end of his account to Nulty, admitting that he remains unsure about who is holding Velma, but is certain Malloy would never have gone to the motel had he not actually spoken with her. When Marlowe tells Nulty that he believes Brunette is involved, Nulty refuses to accompany him to the gangster's yacht, the Lido. After Nulty leaves the hotel, Marlowe calls Malloy and the men meet at the pier and hire a speed boat to reach the floating casino. After making their way through the lively gambling parlor, Marlowe comes upon Cowboy and Nick and, at gunpoint, demands to see Brunette.In Brunette's state room, the gambler denies knowing Velma, but moments later Helen appears and Malloy greets her as Velma. Helen assures Malloy that he will receive his cut for taking the fall for the bank robbery years before and orders him to kill Marlowe. When Malloy hesitates, Marlowe points out that those who knew that Helen had once been a prostitute named Velma all ended up dead.... Marriott, Ray, Jessie and Amthor. Brunette and Helen acknowledge that Judge Grayle is unaware of his wife's past and Brunette was blackmailing her in order to maintain Grayle's protection. Dismayed to realize that he has been Helen's target all along, Malloy turns on her, but she shoots him and is, in turn, shot dead by Marlowe. At that moment, Nulty, who has reconsidered abandoning Marlowe, turns up with several officers. Sickened by the sordid entanglements of the case, Marlowe leaves the scene.In the final scene, Marlow, buoyed by one thought, takes the $2,000 from Brunette and goes to the Crescent Hotel to give the money to Tommy Ray's widow and son."

D'Artagnan's enemy Rochefort (Christopher Lee) was caught spying and is enduring a wait before an amateur firing squad learning to load their rifles on the job. While they figure out how to blindfold a condemned man who has only one eye, Athos and Aramis prepare to launch a smoke bomb as cover while Porthos brings the horses for their escape, but the fuse goes out just as the order is given to fire. Fortunately the entire firing squad misses their target, and while they reload the trio manages to extract the spy. He is returned to his master, Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston), then is sent to obtain D'Artagnan's lover Constance (Raquel Welsh). She is the dressmaker and confidante to Queen Anne (Geraldine Chapman) and a valued hostage if they are to deal with Anne's affair with the Protestant sympathizer, the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward).Rochefort and his men find D'Artagnan and Constance shopping in the public market. When she picks a melon from a basket, a hand appears from within and seizes her. While she is taken away, D'Artagnan engages his enemy in a duel and manages to deliver a slicing blow to Rochefort's hand; Rochefort upsets a cart of potatoes, which spills and buries D'Artagnan. He is rescued by the mysterious and beautiful spy Milady DeWinter (Faye Dunaway) and taken to her private home. He regains consciousness in her bedroom where she is attending him while attired in revealing lingerie, but despite her charms he departs hastily, promising to come back and ""thank her properly."" When he leaves, Milady undresses and prepares to step into her bath, but recoils when she sees the water is tinged red. Rochefort was hiding there, letting his injured hand bleed into her bathwater. As they embrace, they agree to deal with D'Artagnan later.Back at the musketeers' training facility, D'Artagnan ponders his problems while Porthos demonstrates a new sword technique. He flings the sword from its scabbard to sail through the air and hit its mark. Aramis is unimpressed and shows him that the sword could easily be deflected, and they leave arguing the finer points of disarming oneself.An inebriated Athos appears to question D'Artagnan about his new lover. He replies the he loves Milady with his head and Constance with his heart. When asked if he has not ever lost his heart, Athos grows reflective and relates a love story about a man who, unlike him, did lose his heart. It becomes apparent that he is speaking of himself in his life before he became a musketeer. As a nobleman he was a man of honor who fell in love with a mysterious woman and married her, bestowing his title and wealth on her. One day when she fell from her horse, the garter she always wore on her upper arm slipped to reveal the brand of the fleur de lis, identifying her as a criminal. In that moment he lost his honor. Though he had throttled her in his anger, he never knew whether or not she had died. He warns D'Artagnan that such women cause trouble, and the young musketeer agrees that he should stay faithful to Constance.Still needing to repay his debt, D'Artagnan returns to Milady's home and is admitted by her attendant Kitty (Nicole Calfan). Her mistress is away and Kitty has her own interests, so they slip into her bedroom. When Milady returns, Kitty stalls for time and D'Artagnan overhears Milady talking to Kitty about Constance while donning her jewels for the evening; D'Artagnan slips out and re-enters by the front door to pay his proper visit to Milady in her bedroom. Afterward, he calmly asks her where she has taken Constance, and when he grabs her arm the garter there pulls away from a brand of the fleur de lis, and Milady produces two glass daggers filled with acid to attack him. He manages to grab his sword and hold her at bay while he leaves the bedroom, clad only in the sheet, and locks the door. Kitty hands him a cloak and he jumps out the window to escape, finding he has Milady's necklace in his hand. Kitty finally releases her mistress from the bedroom and endures her frustrated blows.Later at the bar, Porthos asks D'Artagnan for money and the necklace slips from his pocket. Athos recognizes it at once, confirming that his wife is still alive. D'Artagnan promises to keep it a secret from the others. Later he goes to the palace to see if the Queen can help find Constance, and is instead captured by the Cardinal's men and taken to his private office. Richelieu remarks upon D'Artagnan's continued good luck and offers friendship in return for the musketeer becoming one of his men, but D'Artagnan refuses and Richelieu warns him that his journey into the battlefront at La Rochelle will be a perilous one.Milady and Rochefort discuss Constance, whom the spy has sent to a private estate. Kitty dutifully gives the information to the musketeers, who agree to help rescue her while D'Artagnan goes ahead toward the battlefront. Constance is fettered in an upstairs room but manages to land a kick on one of the guards when he brings her food; once she has freed herself she runs to the window and finds the courtyard is filled with vicious attack dogs, preventing her escape. The next time a guard comes, she kicks him in the groin before realizing it is Aramis in disguise and she is being rescued. Porthos uses stilts to cross the courtyard with Constance perched on his shoulders to avoid the dogs. The three take her to the convent at Armentieres.D'Artagnan stops at an inn where he plans to meet his friends and finds a note that they were thrown in jail for drunken behavior and sent on a few bottles of wine to drink their health. He declines, saying they will share the wine when they're together again.On the road D'Artagnan is set upon by Rochefort and his hired men, and when the other three musketeers hear dueling in the frigid weather, they join the fray, fighting on an icy lake with unpredictable footing. Still they manage to defeat the gang and take one with them to the inn to question him. He reveals that a meeting is planned at the Red Dove Cote Inn, begs for a drink and is poured some of the wine. Before the others join him, Aramis holds them back as the man quickly goes into convulsions and dies. Sniffing the wine, Aramis says it has been poisoned, probably by Milady.At the Red Dove Cote Inn, Milady meets with the Cardinal and discusses her agenda to rid herself and Rochefort of D'Artagnan and Constance after she does her duty in handling Buckingham, but the Cardinal is unconcerned with her private affairs. She asks for no money for dealing with the duke; she asks instead for carte blanche to deal with her enemies in her own way, and Richelieu produces a vague and craftily written note with his authorization but no words which can be used against him. She tucks it away after he leaves, but suddenly Athos appears and confronts her for the first time since the fateful day when she robbed him of his honor. He asks her for the note, threatening to shoot her if she refuses. Knowing he is capable of it, she surrenders the note.On the battlefield the musketeers have been sent to lend support and see that La Rochelle falls. Athos makes a bet that the four of them can breach the enemy lines and have breakfast atop the bastion--a place where they can discuss matters without the Cardinal's spies within earshot--and they assign Planchet (Roy Kinnear) to bring the ammunition and provisions. They dodge bullets and manage to set up their meal, and Athos gives the note to D'Artagnan and tells them all of the plot to kill Buckingham. Planchet will be assigned to go warn Buckingham, and when the rebels charge the battlement, Athos finds the wall is weak enough that they can push it over to send its stones toppling down on the charging rebels.Milady travels to England to meet Buckingham but fails to convince him to cease aiding the rebels. Outside she prepares a concealed pistol but is caught and sent to the dungeon under the care of his servant Felton (Michael Gothard), a Puritan whose unbreakable faith and detached demeanor the duke trusts. During one visit to check on his prisoner, Milady asks Felton for a Bible, and during his duties he hears her reciting scripture nonstop. Finally she collapses and tells him that she is being persecuted by the Antichrist--Buckingham--and he yields to his doubts and her passions, and later he helps her escape. He proceeds to purchase a knife, meets Buckingham on the docks and uses the weapon to attack his master, who dies from his wounds while Planchet arrives moments too late to warn him.The battle of La Rochelle ends and Rochefort and Milady race the musketeers to Armentieres to claim Constance. The musketeers reach the town nearby just steps ahead of Rochefort, and when they stop for a rest, he gains the lead. The four men remount and give chase, enter the convent by another route but are met by Rochefort and his men. While D'Artagnan and the others battle, the barn next to the convent catches fire, adding to the urgency. Porthos manages to use his new sword technique to dispatch an opponent but catches fire himself; Athos sustains another arm injury and Rochefort escapes.Milady enters the convent disguised as a nun and goes into Constance's room to sit with her. Constance doesn't recognize her in the vestments, continues praying and starts to cry. Milady tells her she should look her best when D'Artagnan arrives, then throws a rosary around Constance's neck and draws it tight.As D'Artagnan finishes dispatching his enemies, Milady leaves Constance's room and attempts to make her escape but is caught by Athos before she can reach her carriage. D'Artagnan bursts into Constance's room to find her strangled body on the floor. He leaves in profound grief and comes upon Rochefort; assuming him the killer, he charges his arch enemy, attacking violently and taking out his anger and misery on him. Again, they are equally matched swordsmen. Aramis and Porthos see them dueling, but Aramis prevents his partner from interfering; it is D'Artagnan's fight alone.By the time the fighting reaches the church, both men have exhausted each other and neither will yield. Rochefort injures D'Artagnan's hand and deals a blow which takes the point off his sword. Desperate, D'Artagnan makes a final lunge and drives his sword home, pinning the spy to the lectern before he falls and dies, and the young musketeer collapses from exhaustion.Later the musketeers gather with their prisoner at a riverbank, standing in judgment of Milady's crimes. They decide the punishment should be death. Athos uses his privileges as a nobleman to hire a headsman and order the execution at the cost of five pistoles. She defiantly demands a trial by a proper court and, when nobody speaks up, she turns to D'Artagnan for help. When he steps forward Athos tells him, in no uncertain terms, that if he moves further the two of them will cross swords and Athos will kill him, so he resumes his place. They watch as the headsman takes Milady in a boat to a small jut of land on the other side of the lake and does his duty; when he returns they grant his request to be paid two pistoles extra for oarsman duties.The musketeers are then rounded up and D'Artagnan finds himself in Cardinal Richelieu's office again. Richelieu reminds him that he refused an offer of friendship and now stands accused of a serious crime. D'Artagnan then produces the Cardinal's own document granting the bearer the privilege to do ""what has been done."" Knowing he has been defeated, the Cardinal casually burns the note and offers his foe a commission as a lieutenant in the musketeers with the name left blank, saying he and his friends are free to go. Perplexed, D'Artagnan leaves and offers the document to all three of his friends, who politely refuse. He worries that as an officer he will lose his friends, but Porthos assures him that they will always remain ""All for one and one for all."""

tt0073019,"['Action', 'contentRating', 'R']","On New Year's Eve 1974 in Los Angeles, California, Monk Riley (Julius Harris), the editor of Glance Magazine, is unable to locate Shawn North, his favorite photographer, so he telephones Shawn's assistant, Friday Foster (Pam Grier), a young African American woman. Monk orders her to the airport to photograph the arrival of Blake Tarr (Thalmus Rasulala), known as ""America's wealthiest black millionaire"", who has been out of the country for years. Before she can leave her apartment, Friday receives a telephone call from Clorils Boston (Rosalind Miles), her best friend and a famous model, who begs Friday to come to her party. Although Clorils claims it is a matter of life and death, Friday explains she has to work.At the airport, Friday bribes a guard to get access to Tarr's private hangar. As she hides and readies her camera, three assassins, Yarbro (Carl Weathers), Chet Freed (Tony Brubaker), and another man, enter carrying automatic pistols and dressed as security guards. As Tarr and his entourage enter the hangar, the three assailants shoot him in the shoulder and kill most of his bodyguards before the police arrive. As Friday photographs the gun battle, Chet is wounded and escapes by a side door while Yarbro bumps into Friday as he runs away. Yarbro leaps into his car, and a car chase ensues during which a police cruiser crashes into a truck. A bleeding Chet arrives at Clorils's home and drops dead at her feet.Later that night, Riley bawls out Friday for almost getting killed, but changes his tune when Shawn North (Stan Stratton) arrives and they develop the film. One of Friday's photographs shows Chet's face. Friday has seen him before, but cannot remember where.Note: a minor unrelated subplot involves Friday's younger teenage brother Cleve (Tierre Turner) who lives with her and does some black market dealing on the sides with a local pimp named Fancy Dexter (Ted Lange) for some valuable items to earn some extra spending money.The next day, Clorils is backstage at a fashion show talking on the telephone, begging ""Charlie"" to help her. When Friday arrives, she goes to assist Shawn, but runs into Colt Hawkins (Yaphet Kotto), an old friend and private detective. Their reunion is interrupted when Madame Rena (Eartha Kitt) steps onstage and starts the fashion show. As models parade Rena's wares, Clorils stumbles from behind the curtain with a knife in her back. With her last dying breath, she declares that she wanted to save Chet from ""Black Widow."" When police lieutenant Jake Wayne (Edmund Cambridge) arrives, Madame Rena tells him she believes that Ford Malotte (Godfrey Cambridge), a rival designer, killed Clorils and reveals that Malotte has been flying Clorils back and forth between Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. for months.Later, Friday is in the shower at her apartment when Yarbro sneaks into her apartment carrying a switchblade knife. The telephone rings, and Friday goes to the living room. She sees Yarbro and runs into the hallway... clad in only a towel. A neighbor appears, and Yarbro flees. After Friday reports the attack to Colt Hawkins and Lt. Wayne, she learns that Chet's body and a cache of narcotics were found in Cloril's house. Friday realizes it was Chet she recognized in her photographs.A few days later, Friday spots Yarbro at Clorils' funeral, but before she can react, Yarbro gets in his car and drives off. Friday leaps into a nearby hearse and chases him to an abandoned warehouse, where Yarbro tries to strangle her. Friday douses him with pepper spray and runs. Two policemen appear and arrest her for trespassing, allowing Yarbro to escape.Later, at the Glance magazine office, Colt Hawkins informs Friday and Riley that Ford Malotte arranged meetings between Clorils and U. S. Senator David Lee Hart (Paul Benjamin) in Washington D.C. Shawn arrives with more photographs of the airport gunfight and Friday recognizes Yarbro as the man who tried to kill her.The next day, Friday and Colt fly to Washington and meet Malotte at a bar catering to a homosexual clientele. Malotte clams up when Friday mentions ""Black Widow."" Thinking Colt's manly charms might persuade him to talk, Friday steps outside. A red Ford Mustang screeches around the corner and chases her down an alley before crashing into a power line and electrocuting the driver. Later, Malotte telephones Blake to inform him that Friday knows about ""Operation Black Widow."" As he talks, Yarbro arrives in a truck and smashes into the phone booth, crushing Malotte.Across town, Friday crashes Senator Hart's fund raising party and meets Rev. Noble Franklin (Scatman Crothers), a lecherous old preacher who invites her to his estate, ""Jericho,"" to give her a ""private interview."" The Senator interrupts them and when Friday tells him she is a friend of Clorils, he suggests they go back to his place. Before they leave, however, the Senator tells his assistant, Charles ""Charlie"" Foley (Jason Bernard), to handle the party guests.At the senator's home, Hart tells Friday that his people believe Blake Tarr staged his own assassination attempt as part of an operation called ""Black Widow."" However, they have not been able to discern what ""Black Widow"" is. After a few drinks, Friday and Hart make love.The next morning, Charlie meets Enos Griffin (Jim Backus), a wheelchair-bound millionaire at his estate somewhere in Virginia who is funding Hart's political career. Charlie tells Enos he believes he can use Friday to flush out Blake Tarr.Back in Los Angeles, Madame Rena orders Friday to meet her at her office. When Friday and Colt arrive, Yarbro appears and shoots Rena. Colt gives chase while the dying Rena gives Friday a telephone number. Colt chases Yarbro down across the streets and rooftops of various buildings where he catches up and kills him in a gunfight. Without informing Colt, Friday telephones the number she was given and explains that Rena and Yarbro are dead. She is advised to come to the City National Bank Building. Once there, she goes to the rooftop and Blake Tarr arrives by helicopter. Tarr explains that ""Black Widow"" is Senator Hart and that something bad is going to happen on Valentine's Day. Tarr takes Friday to his mansion and they make love.The next day, Friday and Colt arrive back in Washington and discover all the black politicians are missing. They arrive at Senator Hart's office where a secretary claims the politician left after saying ""the walls would come crumbling down today"". Realizing this is a reference to the biblical story of Joshua at Jericho, Friday remembers it is also the name of Rev. Franklin's estate. When Friday and Colt step out of the Capitol building, they spot two thugs by their car. Colt tells Friday to telephone Tarr while he distracts the men. Unable to reach Tarr, Friday steals an empty milk truck. She drives to Colt, who has beaten up the two men, and tells him to follow her. However, as Friday drives off, Colt's car refuses to start. Tarr arrives, picks up Colt, and drives after Friday.At Rev. Franklin's hunting retreat, Friday is stopped by a group of armed men. She smashes a milk bottle over a man's head and speeds for the main house. Charlie appears and orders his men to attack. Once inside the house, Friday finds the missing black politicians conducting a meeting. Friday finds Rev. Franklin to warn him that Hart is coming, but Hart appears and explains he is attempting to build a black caucus and the ""walls crumbling down"" is a metaphor for ending prejudice. Bullets shatter windows and riddle the walls. As Rev. Franklin hands out shotguns, Hart realizes Charlie and Enos Griffin manipulated him into calling the meeting so they could get all the black politicians in one place to kill them. A man leaps through a window and Friday shoots him, only to discover he is white man wearing ""black face."" As the battle rages, a helicopter arrives carrying Tarr, Colt and a small army of bodyguards, who catch the attackers in a crossfire. Charlie makes a run for it, but Colt chases him down and knocks him to the ground.Days later back in Los Angeles, Colt visits Friday and finds her apartment full of gifts from both Tarr and Hart. However, she insists Colt is her ""main man."""

tt0073096,"['Western', 'Comedy']","In the early 1930s, Lewis Tater (Jeff Bridges) is an young Iowa farmer who has great ambition to be a Western fiction writer like his idol Zane Grey. Although Lewis registers for a correspondence course offered by the University of Titan in Nevada, he decides he will benefit more by studying on campus, where he can experience the ""real West."" After leaving his parents' farm, he takes a train to Titan, which turns out to be an isolated whistle stop. The ticket agent tells him that no university exists and that the correspondence school is merely several post office boxes that are checked once a week by two con men. Ignoring the agent's advice to return home, Lewis gets a ride into town and checks into a hotel that happens to be the con men's base of operations.During the night, one of the con men attempts to rob Lewis' room, but Lewis awakens and fights, then hastily packs his suitcase, jumps into the con men's car and drives off into the desert. When the car runs out of gas, Lewis grabs his suitcase, as well as a second case that he finds in the boot of the car, and starts walking. The con men retrieve their car, but finding their case missing, begin a search for Lewis.Unprepared for the desert heat, Lewis walks for hours, fantasizing that he is a stoic character in dire circumstances, until life imitates art and he is almost trampled by Howard Pike (Andy Griffith) and other gun slinging cowboys riding horses. The men, who are actors making a ""talking picture"" for a ""Poverty Row"" studio named Tumbleweed Production Company, take Lewis to their camp, where his sunburn and black eye are tended by Miss Trout (Blythe Danner), who is assistant to Kessler (Alan Arkin), the film director.When the troupe returns to Hollywood, Lewis accompanies them and takes a room in a local boardinghouse. Meanwhile, the con men arrive at the vacated shooting site and find a scrap of cardboard bearing the name of the Rio Café, a Hollywood restaurant that supplies the troupe's meals on location.In his boardinghouse room, Lewis continues to write stories, but soon returns to the production company office to ask for a job and Trout gives him an application to fill out. Overhearing them talk, Howard Pike sends Lewis to the Rio, where he is hired as a dishwasher. Not long after, Lewis is cast as an ""extra"" to work with Pike and his colleagues, Wally and Jackson.One day, when Kessler asks for a volunteer to do the risky stunt of jumping from a balcony onto the back of a horse, the veteran stuntmen feign reluctance, forcing Kessler to raise the fee he is willing to pay them. The experienced men continue to hesitate, but Lewis enthusiastically volunteers to do the stunt for no extra money. He accomplishes the task successfully but, afterward, suffers great pain while getting off the horse. Pike explains that when a special stunt is needed, Lewis should wait until enough money is offered to make it worth the risk; otherwise, Lewis will ruin the business and be disliked by his co-workers.Meanwhile, the con men suspect that the Rio is a clue to finding Lewis and proceed there. When Lewis sees them, he runs away before they can confront him. Back in his room, Lewis looks into the purloined case, where he discovers University of Titan stationery, a gun and a few thousand dollars in cash and money orders.Later, after Kessler fires an actor for demanding a raise, he replaces him with Lewis. Although Lewis' acting is at first wooden and unconvincing, he soon becomes so good that Kessler gives him a screen test. Trout, who grows attracted to Lewis, invites him to her home. Charmed that Lewis would rather be a writer than a star, she suggests that he talk to Pike, who, she reveals, is secretly paid by Kessler to help him create realistic cowboy characters.Lewis goes to Pike's apartment and tells him that he is a writer, but is pointedly informed that a person is a writer only when someone else says he is. Despite this rebuke, Pike agrees to look at Lewis's manuscript, which is titled Hearts of the West . Meanwhile, after seeing Lewis's screen test, Kessler decides to invest in him as an upcoming star. The Rio hangs Lewis' head shot on the wall next to photos of famous film cowboys. Among the photos is one of Lewis' heroes, former cowboy star, Billy Pueblo, who seems to have disappeared from the movies. When Lewis wonders aloud about what happened to Billy, Pike says wistfully that the actor became independently wealthy and bought a ranch. Knowing that Lewis will be negotiating with Kessler, Pike advises him not to accept anything less than $150 a week, and if Kessler refuses, to walk out of the room.However, when Lewis follows Howard's advice, Kessler fires him. Trout later explains to Lewis that even the star of the film does not earn that much money and that Pike is not financially savvy. When Lewis refuses to believe that Pike would mislead him, Trout explains that Pike used to known as Billy Pueblo, but his career declined. Trout arranges for Lewis to meet Eddie Polo, a film director and brother-in-law of A. J. Nietz (Donald Pleasence), a major pulp fiction publisher. When Polo is unwilling to introduce Lewis to Nietz, Lewis offers to raise $2,000 for the director's special film project.Using Titan stationary to write a letter of introduction, Lewis proceeds to a bank, opens an account and cashes the con men's money orders. After Lewis presents the $2,000, Polo directs Lewis to visit Nietz's seaside mansion. There, Nietz agrees to look at Lewis' manuscript and a few days later, invites him back for brunch. A lively party is in progress when Lewis arrives, but Nietz takes him aside to meet with Pike, who has submitted ""Hearts of the West"" to Nietz for publication under his own name. Pike explains that alimony payments and other bills made him desperate, but Lewis, hurt that his role model would stoop to plagiarism, refuses to listen and tells him that Billy Pueblo stood for something positive.Returning to Hollywood, Lewis discovers that the con men have searched his room and are waiting in their car in front of his boardinghouse. Lewis sneaks to Trout's apartment, but, finding Kessler there, presumes she is romantically involved with him and leaves. Trout searches for Lewis, unaware that the con men are following her.At the Rio, where Kessler, Pike and the rest of the production crew are holding a stag party in a back room, Trout learns that Lewis is at the apartment of a friend and proceeds there. Shortly after she arrives, the con men burst into the apartment and hold them at gunpoint, as they search for the money. In an unsuccessful attempt to confront them, Lewis is shot twice. Unexpectedly, Pike, ready to make amends for betraying Lewis, enters and, armed with a six-shooter, forces the con men into the closet to wait for the police.Later, as Lewis is being placed into an ambulance, he suggests to Pike that a story of their experience might make enough money to fulfill Pike's dream of independent wealth. However, the former cowboy star plans for Lewis to get the glory. As the con men are led to a paddy wagon to take them away to jail, they ask Pike the identity of ""the kid."" Pike answers, ""Lewis Tater, a writer."" While Lewis is driven away in the ambulance, he continues to create a story in his head."

However, both operate independently in investigating the background of all passengers and crew on the voyage. Ritter has reason to suspect everyone, even his old friend and former mistress, Countess Ursula von Reugen (Anne Bancroft), who vehemently opposes the Nazi regime.Other prime suspects include card sharks Emilio Pajetta (Burgess Meredith) and Major Napier (Rene Auberjonois), Edward Douglas (Gig Young), a suspicious German-American ad executive, as well as several crew members and even the Hindenburg captains Pruss (Charles Durning) and Lehmann (Richard A. Dysart).As the Hindenburg makes its way to Lakehurst Air Field, events conspire against Ritter and Vogel. They soon suspect the rigger Karl Boerth (William Atherton), a former Hitler Youth leader who has become disillusioned with the Nazis. Ritter attempts to arrest him. Boerth resists. He requests help from Ritter, whose son was killed a year before. Boerth's girlfriend, Freda Halle, was killed while trying to escape arrest as the Hindenburg crossed the Atlantic. Boerth, upon hearing the news of Halle's death, plans to commit suicide by staying aboard the airship as the bomb goes off.Ritter eventually agrees with Boerth to set the bomb to detonate at 7:30 p.m., when the airship should have landed and passengers disembarked. While setting up the bomb (a small C-4 plastic explosive), Boerth drops a knife, which was later revealed to have been stolen from Rigger Ludwig Knorr. Vogel starts to work behind Ritter's back, arresting Boerth and confiscating the Countess's passport.As the airship approaches Lakehurst Naval Air Station at 7:00, Ritter now realizes the landing has been delayed and searches for Boerth to ask where the bomb is. Vogel is caught by Ritter torturing Boerth and gets into a fight with Ritter and is knocked unconscious. An injured Boerth tells Ritter the bomb is in the repair patch of gas cell 4. Ritter attempts to defuse the bomb, but is unable to do so in time and is spotted at the last few seconds by a now awakened Vogel. The bomb explodes, killing Ritter instantly and sending Vogel flying down the walkway. Vogel survives, being carried by ground crewmen, while Boerth dies of his burns.At this point the film changes to monochrome in order to match up with the actual newsreel footage of the disaster. Passengers and crew struggle to survive the fire. The disaster scene ends when the camera pans over wreckage, towards a strip of burning fabric that says ""Hindenburg"" on it. The following day, with the fire cleared, a list of passengers who died or survived is described briefly, while the wreckage is examined for the inquiry before being cleaned up.The film ends with a tribute to Herbert Morrison's radio commentary, with the memorable quotation, ""Oh the humanity,"" as the Hindenburg flies once again, only to disappear again in the clouds."
tt0073133,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","LA Police Lt. Phil Gaines (Burt Reynolds) and Nicole Britton (Catherine Deneuve), a high-priced call girl and the lieutenant's girlfriend, have their weekend plans dashed when Gaines receives a call that a dead woman was found on the beach. Before he leaves, the two plan a romantic trip to Rome, Italy.At the police precinct, Gaines and his partner, Sgt. Louis Belgrave (Paul Winfield), meet Marty and Paula Hollinger (Ben Johnson and Eileen Brennan), and ask Marty to view the deceased to see if it is his daughter, Gloria. Upon seeing Gloria's naked lifeless body, Marty punches Gaines in the face, screaming they should have covered her up. Sgt. Belgrave insists they charge Marty with assault, but Gaines apologizes for not covering the girl.Later, Gaines enters an interrogation room to find Belgrave and another police officer beating a confession out of an Albino man (David Estridge). Infuriated by their brutality, Gaines orders the prisoner released and given something to eat. Gaines then learns that Jerry Bellamy (David Spielberg), a murderer he arrested, was paroled after only serving five years of his two life sentences. Gaines goes to his office and stares wistfully at a seven-year old calendar showing the Roman coliseum.That night, Marty Hollinger lies in bed picturing his daughter, Gloria, as she grew from a toddler to teenager. His wife reminds him they ""lost"" Gloria a long time ago. Meanwhile, Gaines stands on his balcony overlooking Los Angeles, California, while Nicole has phone sex with a client. When Nicole hangs up, she complains her job is getting harder every day. Gaines suggests she quit, but is silent when she asks if he will take care of her. To lighten the mood, Nicole encourages him to reminisce about the love affair he had when he visited Rome.The next day, Belgrave and Gaines brief their boss, Capt. John Santoro (Ernest Borgnine), on the Gloria Hollinger case. Although the girl tested positive for semen, there was no sign of rape. Plus, blood tests indicate that Gloria died of suicide. After learning the girl's father is ""a nobody,"" Santoro tells them to close the file.Meanwhile, Nicole entertains mob attorney, ""Kingfish"" Leo Sellers (Eddie Albert), on his yacht. Sellers goes ashore to make a telephone call. In Akron, Ohio, his call is answered by a man at a telephone booth. Three men leave a union meeting hall, and are killed when the car explodes. Afterward, the man tells Sellers ""it is done"", and hangs up.Back in Los Angeles, Gaines removes a picture of Sellers and Gloria Hollinger from the dead girl's wallet. Sgt. Belgrave snatches it from him and gives it to another officer to enlarge it and make additional prints. The Hollingers arrive to collect their daughter's personal effects, and Marty refuses to accept his daughter's death was a suicide. When Gaines tells him the case is closed, Marty threatens to find the killer and take care of him. After Marty leaves, Paula explains he has never been the same after his traumatic experiences in the Korean War and a sympathetic Gaines gives her his business card in case she needs his help.Gaines learns that Jerry Bellamy has killed two women and taken a third hostage while holed up in a downtown factory. When Gaines arrives at the scene, Bellamy threatens to shoot his prisoner unless the police lieutenant comes in alone. Inside, Bellamy orders Gaines to kneel, then, as the killer rants about the evils of women, Belgrave drops from a skylight, distracting the killer. Gaines pulls his gun and kills Bellamy.Later, Gaines and Belgrave are drinking in Gaines's office, when Belgrave insists they investigate Leo Sellers's connection to Gloria's death. He argues that Seller is a mob lawyer, and Gloria was carrying an envelope holding $2,000 in cash and had Sellers's picture in her wallet. Knowing Seller is one of Nicole's clients, a reluctant Gaines agrees.Meanwhile, Marty collects Gloria's things from Gloria's roommate, Peggy Summers (Catherine Bach), who shows him a much larger photograph of Gloria and Sellers. Learning Gloria was a stripper who dated Herbie Dalitz, the emcee at her club, Marty goes to confront Herbie.That night, Gaines confesses he is having trouble accepting Nicole's profession. When he refuses to marry her, she packs to leave him. Gaines slaps her and she hits him in the head with an ashtray. He throws her on the bed, and what starts as a violent kiss turns passionate and they make love.The next morning, a narcotics officer gives Gaines a tape recording of Sellers calling Ohio and the bomb blast that killed the union men. He explains that the telephone booth was ""bugged"" to catch drug deals, but the tape now belongs to homicide. Later, Gaines and Belgrave respond to a telephone call from Paula Hollinger and go to her home where they find a badly beaten Marty. Marty says Gloria was at a sex party at a home owned by a man named Leo. Gaines agrees to investigate Gloria's death, but only if Marty promises not to take any more chances.Gaines interviews Herbie Dalitz, who admits procuring Gloria for Leo after he saw her in a pornographic movie. When questioned, Leo Sellers admits partying with Gloria, but insists she left his house alive. When Gaines asks if Leo feels any responsibility for the girl's suicide, Leo answers she was screwed up before he met her. Gaines then reveals that police taped his call to Ohio. Leo's only response is to say that he knows Nicole and Gaines are living together and admires that Gaines does not let her profession get in the way of their relationship.Later, Gaines has drinks with Paula Hollinger and learns that Gloria was the result of an affair she had while Marty was in a veteran's hospital being treated for mental illness. Although Marty learned of the affair, he never suspected he was not Gloria's father. The next day, Gaines tells Marty that Gloria committed suicide. When Marty accuses Gaines of being paid off, the lieutenant shows him film of Gloria and Peggy Summers having sex with a man. Marty leaves in tears, goes to Peggy and beats her until she reveals Leo's last name. When he leaves, Peggy calls Belgrave.Carrying a loaded gun, Marty confronts Sellers at his house. Sellers ask why kill him, as there ""were a lot of men who led Gloria astray?"" Marty replies that he cannot kill everyone and shoots him between the eyes. Gaines and Belgrave arrive to find Leo dead and Marty slumped in a chair. Gaines tries to get Marty to understand the trouble he is, but Marty just repeats that he will have his day in court. After learning Marty bought the gun from a pawnshop without giving his name, Gaines takes the pistol and shoots Marty in the shoulder, then concocts a story that Sellers pulled the gun when Marty confronted him and, in the ensuing struggle, Marty was wounded and Leo killed. Belgrave protests, but Gaines explains that even though Leo did not kill Gloria, he was a murderer and there are times justice is served by ""sticking up for the Marty's of the world.""Gaines telephones Nicole and tells her to meet him at the airport so they can fly to Sausalito, California, and get married. After hanging up, Gaines walks into a liquor store, where an armed man attempts to rob the place. Gaines intercedes, but he is shot dead. Later, Belgrave finds Nicole at the airport and breaks the news. As they leave, an airplane headed for Rome takes off."

tt0073172,"['Comedy', 'Drama']","Prior to the opening credits we see portions of a black-and-white stag film that is shot in the course of the movie. Voices are overheard that make it apparent that men and women are watching this in the present day. At the end a man complains that there was no ""Come shot"", something that will later develop into a plot point.The story takes place in Hollywood in the year 1930, shortly after the start of the talkie period. A visionary and gifted young Hollywood director known as Boy Wonder (Richard Dreyfuss) has fallen out of favor with the studios. This is ostensibly due to his reluctance to lower his standards or abandon his artistic and experimental style (such as using a hand-held camera) for the sake of churning out lesser quality stag films for easy money, due to his alcoholism and his fear of leaving his house (agoraphobia). He works out of his decaying mansion, which is the only one left on a street being turned into a freeway.On the morning of this particular shoot, a heroin-addicted waitress, named Harlene (Veronica Cartwright) arrives. Harlene was once a well-known and respected star during the silent film era and she too is reluctant to join the ranks of the ""talkies"" due in part to her unappealing, high-pitched squeaky voice. She is now the star in the first of his six-picture deal. She prepares and shoots heroin while Boy Wonder drinks heavily during a conversation between them about the changing times in Hollywood.An actor called Rex the Wonder Dog (Stephen Davies) soon arrives wearing a white suit with grass stains on his knees, having just came from his job working for a mortician. During his introduction, Rex gullibly believes a man from a studio who that says that he will put him in the mainstream talkies, and has an appointment to meet him in his hotel room later that same day.Boy Wonder awkwardly attempts to make an artistic film using an actress under the influence of heroin and an actor who becomes increasingly frustrated with the director and all of his poetic talk, much of which he admits he doesn't understand. The scene goes wrong when Rex gets out of control during the action and Boy Wonder needs to smash a wine bottle over his head to get him to stop.Enter Big Mac (Bob Hoskins), a porno film producer. He has heroin packets in his jacket pocket, an unlit cigar in his mouth, wads of money for Rex and a pretty brunette wannabe actress named Cathy Cake (Jessica Harper) hanging on his arm. Harlene takes her payment in heroin and soon dies from an overdose in an upstairs bedroom. Rex finds the dead body and everyone is terribly upset over this turn of events. Boy Wonder talks about continuing his film, but Rex refuses to perform with a dead woman.Big Mac offers Rex a part in a mainstream movie in order to convince Rex to help him bury the body and, while the two are away, Cathy and Boy Wonder develop a chemistry that eventually leads to another ironic high point in the film. Boy Wonder offers to film Cathy for insert shots of her nude body to double for the late Harlene. At first, Cathy refuses to undress, but when she does, she soon becomes aroused by Boy Wonder filming her. After a while, he makes love to her believing he has found something of a soulmate, but she is disappointed when she learns the camera was off. Boy Wonder's sexual experience with Cathy marked the end of his longstanding problem with impotence, which was evidently related to his emotional problems.Boy Wonder quickly realizes that this romantic encounter was simply a ploy to get her into the film, and that she has used and directed him the way he used and directed her. Big Mac and Rex return to find both of them half naked. In a jealous rage, Big Mac ends his six-picture stag film contract with Boy Wonder, who by this time is completely drunk. Rex beats up Boy Wonder in retribution for hitting him earlier with the wine bottle by doing likewise. Big Mac takes the film reel that Boy Wonder used and leaves with Rex and Cathy. After Boy Wonder is left alone in his home, a man knocks at the door. This is presumably Clark Gable, a then little-known actor who had been said to be intending to call on Boy Wonder about a film project. Boy Wonder will not answer the door, and after a short time the unseen man leaves. The end of the film finds Boy Wonder alone in his spacious living room, sitting in the exact same place where the film began; playing piano and singing, pondering what he'll eat for lunch.Note: This last remark brings home the fact that, while a great deal of talk and drama has occurred in the course of the nearly two-hour long film, the movie was shot in real time."
tt0073195,"['Adventure', 'Thriller']","During an evening beach party on a New England coast, attractive blonde Chrissie Watkins (Susan Backlinie) catches the eye of partygoer Tom Cassidy (Jonathan Filley) and leads him away from the group to go skinny-dipping in the ocean. Tom, quite drunk, passes out on the sand before he can even undress, but Chrissie, undeterred, strips down and dives into the surf.As Chrissie swims further from the shoreline, she pauses to tread water. An unseen creature notices Chrissie's paddling legs from beneath the surface and begins to approach her. Chrissie is quickly attacked by the creature, which grabs hold of her leg and, after a violent struggle, drags her below the waves. Her screams for help go unheard, and eerie silence follows her submergence.The surrounding town of Amity is preparing for the upcoming Independence Day weekend, their most financially lucrative time of the year. The community depends on tourism as a major source of economic support and waits eagerly for each summer to arrive when herds of mainlanders come to savor Amity's shores. Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), Amity's chief of police, receives a call at home regarding Chrissie Watkins' disappearance. Following the report made by Tom Cassidy that she was last seen off the coast, Brody goes to the beach with his deputy Jeff Hendricks (Jeffrey Kramer) to search for clues. Hendricks soon stumbles upon the segmented remains of Chrissie, washed up on the shore and being feasted upon by crabs.Back at the police station, Brody receives a call from the coroner (Robert Nevin) , who determines that Chrissie Watkins was the victim of a shark attack. Fearing for the safety of Amity's many swimmers, Brody immediately prepares to close the beaches until further investigations can be made. His intentions are quickly noticed by Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), who, fearing for the income loss that would result from closing the beach at such a pivotal point in the summer, attempts to convince Brody that a shark attack is too hasty a conclusion, and pressures him and the coroner to change Chrissie's official cause of death to mutilation by boat propeller. Brody remains dedicated to the safety of Amity's citizens and tourists, regardless of the financial toll the town might endure. However, Vaughn forbids him to close the beaches just yet.Over the next few days, ferryloads of tourists arrive on Amity's docks. The beaches are crowded each day, and Brody is extremely concerned about more potential attacks. As Brody and his wife Ellen (Lorraine Gary) sit in the sand, Brody scans the shoreline for any sign of trouble. A ways down the beach, young Alex Kintner (Jeffrey Voorhees) asks his mother for permission to go swimming. Though Mrs. Kintner (Lee Fierro) notes that her son's fingers are starting to ""prune"" from the time he has already spent in the water that day, she allows him ten more minutes. Alex and his yellow raft enter the ocean one last time before being set upon by what is unmistakably an enormous shark. Amid the ensuing panic of the other beachgoers, Mrs. Kintner, who had not seen the attack, calls out desperately for her son as the bloodied and shredded remains of his raft wash up in the surf.With dozens of witnesses to Alex Kintner's gruesome death, the presence of a shark in Amity waters is undeniable and Brody is finally permitted to close the beaches. Alex's grieving mother offers a $3000 reward to anyone who can catch the shark that killed her son, and a town meeting is held to discuss the official shark problem. Brody announces that the police department is expanding its efforts to keep the beaches safe, as well as bringing in a shark expert from the Oceanographic Institute to assist them. Most of the assembled townspeople are more concerned with finances than safety, and remain angry about the beaches being closed, although Mayor Vaughn assures them it will only be for 24 hours. The chatter is quelled by Sam Quint (Robert Shaw), an eccentric and roughened local fisherman who guarantees the capture and slaughter of the offending shark for the price of $10,000. Though his offer is not accepted at that point, Quint seems confident that the job will fall to him eventually.With Mrs. Kintner's reward made public, scores of amateur shark hunters crowd Amity's docks, coming from all over the Northeast. Two local men make a clumsy attempt to lure the shark with a pork roast, which results in one of them nearly becoming the shark's third victim. Arriving at the same time as the horde of overconfident fishermen is Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), the shark expert from the Oceanographic Institute hired by the Amity police. After meeting with Brody, Hooper is allowed to view the remains of Chrissie Watkins, which are brought to him in an ominously small container. Hooper, visibly shaken after examining the mangled body parts, assures Brody that Chrissie did not die in a boating accident, but was attacked by a shark.The town breathes a sigh of relief when the corpse of a large tiger shark is displayed on the docks, having been caught by some of the contending fishermen. Brody is initially elated, believing the nightmare to be over, until Hooper examines the creature's mouth and determines that its bite radius does not match the wounds on Chrissie Watkins' remains, and therefore is likely not the shark they are seeking. Hooper, wanting to be certain, suggests that he examine the contents of the shark's stomach, as its slow digestive system would ensure that any recent meals would still be inside. Brody supports this plan, but Vaughn seems disturbed by the notion and disapproves.The crowd falls silent as Mrs. Kintner arrives, clad in black and choking back tears, presumably returning from her son's funeral. She approaches Brody and slaps him across the face, furiously accusing him of keeping the beaches open despite having prior knowledge that there was a man-eating shark in the water. Brody, angry and ashamed, becomes all the more determined to prevent further attacks.While Brody attempts to unwind at home with Ellen and their children, Hooper stops by to discuss the shark situation, underlining his earlier suspicion that the captured tiger shark is not the animal responsible for the deaths of Alex Kintner and Chrissie Watkins. He believes that the culprit is not a tiger shark, but a Great White, and that unless it is stopped, it will likely remain in Amity's waters until its food source is depleted. Hooper and Brody decide to examine the shark's stomach contents themselves, regardless of Mayor Vaughn's opinions.The men visit the deserted docks at night and locate the dead tiger shark. Hooper slices its belly open, only to find some bisected fish, several tin cans, and a Louisiana license plate, leading him to theorize that the shark made it's way up the Atlantic coast from the Gulf of Mexico. Finding no human remains, Hooper and Brody confirm that this cannot be the shark they are after.Hooper convinces Brody to continue their investigation out on the water, though Brody is terrified of the ocean. Using sonar equipment, Hooper locates a large object a good distance away from the shoreline. Brody recognizes it as the boat of Ben Gardner (Craig Kingsbury), a local fisherman. Hooper decides to investigate the half-submerged craft, despite Brody's protests, and dons his scuba gear before entering the water. Hooper discovers a large hole in the hull of the boat, and finds an enormous tooth embedded in the side. While examining the tooth, he is suddenly horrified to see the corpse of Ben Gardner floating out of the hull, one of his eyes missing. Hooper drops the tooth and his flashlight and rushes to the surface.Brody and Hooper make yet another attempt to reason with the mayor, hoping their latest discoveries will make a difference. Vaughn, however, still stubbornly dismisses their arguments, insisting that even with the evidence of Ben Gardner's ravaged boat, there is no proof that a shark is responsible. Hooper explains that he pulled the tooth of a Great White Shark out of the hull of Gardner's boat, but Vaughn merely rebuffs him once again since Hooper cannot produce the tooth he dropped in the water. Though he allows Brody and Hooper to take precautions to keep the beaches safe, he refuses to close them.Independence Day weekend finally arrives, bringing plenty of tourists, but the beachgoers are made uneasy by the numerous police boats patrolling the water for the shark. Vaughn is concerned that no one is swimming, and asks a personal friend in attendance to enter the water, along with his wife and grandchildren, to put everyone's minds at ease. The man and his family reluctantly and warily obey, and others begin to relax and follow suit.Remaining on the beach, Brody is aiding with shark patrol. When his elder son Michael (Chris Rebello) wishes to take his new sailboat out into the water with his friends, Brody asks him to take it into the adjacent estuary just to be safe. Michael reluctantly agrees. In the meantime, a dorsal fin appears among the swimmers in the main water, and panic erupts. The crowd scrambles back onto the beach and the police boats close in, only to discover that the ""shark"" is merely a cardboard fin wielded by two young pranksters in snorkel gear.The beachgoers begin to relax, but a young woman overlooking the water sees the unmistakable form of a huge shark making its way into the estuary where Michael and his friends are sailing. The woman's cry is first dismissed as another prank, but when Ellen reminds her husband that their son is in the pond, Brody goes to investigate. Michael and his friends are approached by a man in a rowboat (Ted Grossman), who is instructing them on knotting techniques, when both vessels are suddenly capsized by the shark. The startled sailors surface, and Michael watches in paralyzed horror as the man fails to reach his rowboat before the shark rips him apart.Michael and his friends are brought safely to shore, though Michael is taken to the hospital to be treated for shock. Brody confronts Vaughn once again and puts his foot down, demanding that real action be taken to deal with the shark. Vaughn, for once, is vulnerable and shaken, realizing that his own children were on the beach that day as well. He finally relents and gives Brody full permission to close the beaches and do all that is necessary to stop the shark. Sam Quint is immediately hired.Though Quint, a vastly experienced shark hunter, desires to take on the mission alone, Brody insists that he and Hooper will go as well. There is instant tension between Quint and Hooper, with Quint seeing Hooper as a rich snob with no real shark-hunting experience, and Hooper seeing Quint as a reckless thrill-seeker with a bullish attitude. Though Hooper proves himself to be a capable sailor, the discomfort remains as the three men embark on their voyage in Quint's boat, the ""Orca.""Once out to sea, the men set about attracting the shark by ladling chum off the stern of the boat. Quint attaches a line of piano wire to a sturdy rod secured against a specially-designed fishing chair on the deck. After hours of waiting, the wire goes taut and eventually snaps as the immense creature swims under the boat before disappearing again. Brody, Hooper, and Quint realize the enormous strength of their adversary.As the voyage presses on with no further sign of the shark, Brody grumpily ladles more chum off the back of the boat when, without warning, the massive head of a Great White shark emerges briefly in their wake. Brody is stunned and alerts the others. Hooper notices the shark beginning to circle the boat, and Quint rushes out for a look. He estimates that the shark is 25 feet long, and weighs three tons. After barking orders to Brody and Hooper, Quint begins to fire harpoons tied to plastic barrels, intended to both slow the shark down and make its presence more visible. Though Quint hits the shark with three harpoons, the barrels have no effect and the shark easily pulls them underwater. Just in time, Hooper manages to attach a tracking device to the beast before it retreats again.That night, the men have dinner and drinks below deck, and Hooper surprisingly begins to bond with Quint as they compare scars from their experiences with various sea creatures. Brody notices that Quint has had a tattoo removed, and Quint admits that the former tattoo represented the US Navy cruiser Indianapolis, on which he had been a sailor in World War II. Quint goes on to illustrate the horrible day in July of 1945 when the Indianapolis was sunk by Japanese torpedoes, leaving over 1,100 men floundering in shark-infested waters. Quint witnessed 800 of his comrades being picked off by sharks, and is clearly affected by the chilling memory. The experience, combined with survivor's guilt, had ignited Quint's deep-seated hatred of sharks and the ruthless satisfaction he finds in hunting them. After the solemnity of Quint's story, the men sing a rowdy sea chantey to lighten the mood, but are interrupted by the returning shark violently crashing into the boat and causing a leak. Quint rushes on deck and fires a rifle at the three telltale barrels, but the shark escapes once again.The next day, the men attempt to repair the boat, with limited success. Seawater has contaminated the diesel fuel, and the black smoke billowing from the exhaust pipe confirms engine damage. When the shark returns, Quint instructs Hooper to grab the barrels with a hook and secure them to the stern. Hooper succeeds, and Quint attempts to drag the shark by powering the boat to full throttle, but the shark uses its incredible strength to pull the boat in the opposite direction, nearly capsizing it and causing further structural damage before Quint cuts the ropes attached to the boat. The shark breaks free from the barrels and submerges again. Quint demonstrates his mad obsession with shark hunting by destroying the radio on which Brody was attempting to call for help. The shark begins to chase the boat, and Quint steers back toward land at full speed, dismissing Hooper's protests that he is overtaxing the already damaged engine. When the engine inevitably fails, the boat is left to slowly sink. Quint, strangely calm, offers life jackets to the other men, though he takes none for himself.Running out of options, Hooper resorts to putting on his scuba gear and having Quint and Brody lower him into the water inside a shark-proof cage, his aim being to inject the shark with poison using a harpoon syringe. Quint points out that the needle is too small to pierce the shark's hide, but Hooper believes he can inject the beast in the mouth. The cage proves to be no match for the shark, who attacks Hooper with such ferocity that he drops the harpoon and is forced to hide in a reef while his cage is destroyed. Brody and Quint haul up the remains of the shark cage, and can only assume that Hooper is dead. They barely have time to react before the shark leaps from the water like a breaching whale and lands most of its body on the sinking stern of the boat, nearly breaking the vessel in two. Quint and Brody desperately cling to the cabin as the boat is upended, with the shark's gaping mouth at the bottom of the drop. Quint ultimately loses his grip and, despite Brody's efforts to pull him to safety, slides into the mouth of the shark and is gruesomely killed. The shark, with Quint's bloodied corpse in its mouth, slides back into the water.Horrified, and believing himself to be the only survivor of this seemingly doomed mission, Brody hastily enters the cabin of the rapidly sinking boat and finds one of Hooper's pressurized air tanks. The shark smashes through the side of the boat, its enormous mouth perilously close to Brody, who attempts to fend it off by bludgeoning it with the tank. The shark retreats, with the air tank now lodged in its jaws.With little more than the boat's mast remaining above water, Brody climbs to its summit with a rifle in his hand. Now possessing some of Quint's courage and madness, Brody begins to fire at the approaching shark, aiming at the air tank in its mouth. At last, Brody hits his mark. The tank explodes, taking the shark's head with it, and Brody laughs maniacally as blood and shark flesh rain down around him into the sea.Moments after the shark's vibrant destruction, Hooper finally surfaces, and the exhausted Brody is relieved to see him alive. The men share a weak chuckle before assembling a makeshift raft and paddling back to Amity's shore."

She wrote Johnny, but Colby intercepted her letters and destroyed them. Believing Johnny had abandoned her, June then became an alcoholic. Johnny asks Jesse if he knows all this, why is the sheriff charging him with attempted rape? Jesse confesses he was dishonorably discharged from the army for being a homosexual, and Colby is blackmailing him with that knowledge. When Johnny threatens to tell Jesse's secret, the sheriff snarls that in this town, the only thing lower than a Indian is a homosexual.Later, a drunken White Eagle comes to the jail and promises to talk to Colby, chief to chief, but Johnny sends him away. White Eagle goes home, dresses in the vestments of his office, including a war bonnet, and goes to the bar to talk to Colby. When White Eagle threatens to call a war council against the town, Colby orders Newt and his men to hang the old man.

J.B. reaches into the cab for the trucks keys and Newt's foot slips off the brake, leaving White Eagle dangling in the air.Later, Johnny asks J.B. why no one was arrested, and is told that Colby insists the incident be reported as an accident.

When the second man revives, he discovers he is tied up with sticks of dynamite strapped to him. Johnny lights the fuse and tells the man he has two minutes to think about Nenya. Johnny runs away and the man blows up to pieces.Although Jesse wants to call in the state police to hunt Johnny, Colby refuses, frightened that outsiders may look askance at the murder of White Eagle.A few days later, Johnny finds Newt at home watching a western movie on television. Johnny takes him to the desert, and buries him up to his chin before gouging out his eyes and leaves him for dead.Next, Johnny finally ambushes Colby in his barn, puts a noose around his neck, strings him up and whips him.

tt0073324,"['Horror', 'contentRating', 'Not', 'Rated']","Ever since his father died, Frederic [Jean-Loup Philippe] has been unable to remember
anything about his childhood, even though his mother has told him all
about it. One night, while at a party, Frederic notices a photograph of
some castle ruins near a beach. They look familiar to him, and he recalls
an incident that happened 20 years ago, when he was 12. He was lost. It
was getting dark, and he went to the castle where he was invited in by a
young girl [Annie Briand] dressed all in white. He spent the night there and became
infatuated with her. To thank her for her kindness, Frederic placed a toy
on her steps before he left to go home.When Frederic tells his mother [Natalie Perrey] about the memory, she denies that it
ever happened, so Frederic pays a visit to the photographer to find out
where the photo was taken. The photographer tells him that she's been paid
not to reveal the location but later relents and tells him to meet her at
midnight at the aquarium and she will tell him then. To kill time,
Frederic goes to the cinema. As he watches the movie, he notices the girl
in white standing in the doorway. He follows her outside. She leads him
into a cemetery and down into a crypt where he finds four coffins. He
opens one of the coffins to find several bats inside.Unknowingly, Frederic has released four vampiresses. Frederic runs
outside where he meets a woman who claims to be the girl he met 20 years
ago in the ruins, even though she looks nothing like her. She leads him to
a room in an old abandoned building. When he asks her to identify the toy
that he left with her 20 years ago, she cannot, confirming Frederic's
suspicion that she is working for the same people that paid the
photographer to keep quiet. For some reason, they do not want him to find
the girl. Suddenly, the woman bolts from the room, locking the door behind
her. While the girl in white watches, two of the vampiresses unlock the
door and release Frederic.It is now midnight, and Frederic goes to the aquarium where he finds
that the photographer has been murdered. A man with a briefcase walks
past, and Frederic follows him into the Metro. When the man pulls a gun on
him, Frederic kicks the gun from his hand, pulls the cord to stop the
train, and runs away. The man follows, cornering Frederic on a balcony.
Meanwhile, the two vampires throw a switch that turns on myriad fountains,
which afford Frederic with cover, and he is able to escape.Frederic tells his mother about seeing the girl in white. She tries
to convince him that he is mad and, while Frederic is changing clothes,
she calls the hospital. When Frederic leaves the house, he is immediately
captured by two ambulance drivers and taken to the hospital where he is
placed in a straitjacket and told that he is going to receive electroshock
therapy. While pacing in his room, Frederic sees the girl in white. He
begs her to speak to him if she truly exists, and she mouths the words ""Je
t'aime"". Then she disappears. Two nurses come to take Frederic to the
psychiatrist, but they turn out to be the two vampires. Instead, they
attack the psychiatrist, untie the straitjacket, and allow Frederick to
escape.While running down the street, Frederic sees a blind man selling
postcards of the ruins, so he buys one and learns that it is called
Sauveterre Castle. Certain that the girl in white is calling for his help,
Frederic catches the train to Sauveterre. It is just as he remembers it.
He even finds the toy that he left lying on the castle steps. He walks
through the castle looking for the girl. Eventually, he comes upon a room
where he finds books, dolls, toys, candles, a coffin, and a picture album
with his picture in it. Just as Frederic attempts to open the coffin, his
mother appears.She tells him the story of the girl in white. Her name is Jennifer,
and she's a vampire. Jennifer was imprisoned in Sauveterre Castle when she
was 16 in order to prevent the vampire curse from spreading. It was
Jennifer who killed Frederic's father. The corpses of the four vampires
freed by Frederic were moved to the abandoned vault in Paris. While three
men track down and stake the four vampires and build a bonfire to burn
their bodies, Frederic's mother sends him back into the castle with orders
to kill Jennifer and bring her head. But Frederic cannot do it and,
instead, brings the head of a statue which he tosses into the bonfire.After everyone leaves, Frederic returns to the castle and awakens
Jennifer. She tells him how she learned to project her sight and then her
spirit while she lay in her coffin waiting for Frederic to come. He allows
her to turn him into a vampire, and they both get into her coffin and let
the tide carry them out to sea. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"
tt0073341,"['Adventure', 'History', 'War']","Lahore, British India, 1885.While working late one night as a correspondent at the offices of the Northern Star newspaper in India, Rudyard Kipling (Christopher Plummer) is approached by a ragged, seemingly crazed derelict, who reveals himself to be his old acquaintance Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine). Peachy begins to tell Kipling the story of how he and his comrade-in-arms Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot (Sean Connery) traveled to remote Kafiristan (in modern-day Afghanistan; the province is now known as Nuristan), became ""gods"", and ultimately lost everything.Three years earlier.Dravot and Carnehan had met Kipling under less than auspicious circumstances; Carnehan, a former Colour sergeant of the Queen's Own Royal Loyal Light Infantry, pick-pocketed Kiplings's pocket watch but was forced to return it as he was a fellow Freemason. Carnehan claims to be an expert in ""whiskey, women, waistcoats, and bills of fare."" Both Dravot and Carnehan are in the process of blackmailing a local Rajah by posing as newspaper correspondents of ""The Northern Star"" newspaper, which outrages the real correspondent (Kipling). To save their lives, Kipling has the local district commissioner arrest both Dravot and Carnehan, who obliquely blackmail the commissioner himself.Despite being accomplished gun smugglers, swindlers, fencers of stolen goods, con-men, and blackmailers, both of them are bitter that after fighting to make India part of the British Empire, they will have little to return home apart from dead-end jobs. Both Dravot and Carnehan turn up at Kipling's office and explain their biggest gamble yet: feeling that India is too small for men such as them, they intend to travel to Kafiristan, a small and remote country to help a local king overcome his enemies, overthrow him, and become ""gods""/rulers themselves before stealing various riches and returning to England in triumph.After signing a contract pledging mutual loyalty and forswearing drink and women until they achieved their grandiose aims, Peachy and Danny (taking along 20 Martini Henry rifles stolen from a local armory) set off on an epic overland journey north beyond the Khyber Pass. Kipling, after attempting to dissuade the men, gives Dravot his masonic emblem as a token of brotherhood. Over the next few weeks, Dravot and Carnehan travel through Afghanistan, fighting off a group of bandits at a campfire, trekking through a blizzard and avalanches as they make their way into the unknown land of Kafiristan (literally ""Land of the Infidels"").They chance upon a Gurkha soldier who goes by the name Billy Fish (Saeed Jaffrey), the sole survivor of a missing mapping expedition sent several years earlier which had been lost in an avalanche. Billy speaks English as well as the local Dari language. Acting as translator and interpreter of customs and manners, he smooths the path of Dravot and Carnehan as they begin their rise, offering their services as military advisers, trainers, and war leaders to the chief of the much-raided village of Er-Heb. Dravot and Carnehan muster a force to attack the villagers' most-hated enemy, the Bashkai. During the battle, Dravot is struck in the chest by an arrow, but is unharmed, leading the natives to believe that he is a god. In fact, the arrow was stopped by a bandolier hidden beneath his clothing. As victory follows victory, the defeated are recruited to join the swelling army.Finally, nobody is left to stand in their way, and they are summoned to the holy city of Sikandergul, where the chief high priest, Kafu Selim, sets up a re-enactment of the arrow incident, to determine whether Dravot is a man or a god by seeing whether or not he bleeds. When Dravot flinches, the monks grab him and open his shirt to stab him, only to be stopped by Dravot's Masonic jewel. By coincidence, the symbol on the jewel matches one known only to the highest holy man, the symbol of ""Sikander"" (a linguistic corruption of Alexander the Great), who had conquered the country thousands of years before and promised to return. The holy men are convinced Dravot is the immortal son of Sikander. They hail him as king and lead the two men down to storerooms heaped with treasure (gold, silver, diamonds, emeralds, rubies, among various jewels) that belonged to Sikander, which now belongs to Dravot.As the months pass, Carnehan is anxious to leave with the treasure before winter arrives and heavy snow closes the mountain passes (and before the natives learn the truth about them). Dravot, however, has developed delusions of grandeur. First, Dravot 'suggests' that Carnehan bow to him like the others, ostensibly to ""keep up appearances"" in front of the natives and continue the deception. He adjudicates disputes among local people and villages, and issues proclamations overseeing their administration. He begins making plans to turn the land into a modern country, to the extent that he envisages eventually meeting Queen Victoria ""as an equal."" Resigned that Dravot's mind is made up, Carnehan decides to take as much loot as he can carry on a small mule train and leave alone.Meanwhile, Dravot decides to take a wife after seeing the beautiful Roxanne (Shakira Caine), and invites Carnehan as a witness. Roxanne, having a superstitious fear that she will burst into flames if she consorts with a god, tries frantically to escape, biting Dravot during the wedding ceremony. The bite draws blood, and the high priest exclaims that Dravot ""not a god or a devil but a man"". When everyone sees it, they realize that Dravot and Carnehan have deceived and used them. Carnehan and Billy quickly grab Dravot off the podium and hurry away.A large crowd of angry natives pursue Dravot and Carnehan, who order their loyal troops to open fire on them. As their forces and ammunition dwindle, Dravot and Carnehan offer Billy a horse to escape, but Billy refuses and courageously charges into the mob with a kukri single-handedly, before being killed amidst the mob. As the two men are soon surrounded captured, Dravot apologizes to Carnehan for spoiling their plans, and Carnehan forgives him. Now resigned to his fate, Dravot is forced to walk to the middle of a rope bridge over a deep gorge as the ropes are cut, casting him into the gorge.Afterwords, the Carnehan was crucified between two pine trees, but he was cut down the next day when he survives the ordeal. Eventually, he makes his way back to India, but his mind has become unhinged by his sufferings. In the present, as Carnehan finishes his story, he presents Kipling with Dravot's severed head, still wearing its crown, thereby confirming the tale to be true."

However Emma insists that Hermann, her husband, will never be converted into a vegetarian. Ernst, Emmas son, continues to assemble electrical sockets. He tells his wife Helene about the cold weather in Finland, expressing his distaste for their vacation selection. She insists on the importance of going to a cold and quiet place for the sake of their unborn child. He reluctantly accepts even though he also works in a cold environment. Emma looks over at a clock and wonders where her husband could be. Just then, a breaking news flash is heard on the radio. The reporter announces that a worker at a chemical plant in Frankfurt has beaten a fellow employee to death, before committing suicide. Emma wonders if a tire plant is the same thing as a chemical plant. Helene continues to rant on about all the filth and pollution as well as the poor working conditions in the chemical plants. As the camera zooms out, the three clean up the electrical sockets off the table and begin to set the table for dinner. Suddenly, the door bell rings. Emma assumes that it must be Hermann, who must have forgotten his keys. A man is at the door, looking distressed and upset. He explains to Emma that there is not much time, but there is terrible news. Hermann has killed the bosss son, Dr. Berthold before killing himself. He explains that the fear of mass layoffs were probable cause for Hermanns actions. Ernst puts a hand on the shoulder of a speechless and shocked Emma.The scene cuts to inside a dark club with women dressed in very little clothing. Corinna, is told she has an important phone call from her mother. Corrina doesnt want to answer because her boss, Hennecke, hates calls during working hours. Corrina decides to answer the call anyway. Emma is on the other line and apologizes to Corrina for calling, though it is an important matter. Emma urges Corinna to come home as her father Hermann has killed himself. Corinna tells her mother not to cry or get upset, she will be home as soon as she can. Corinna hangs up the phone and goes back inside to talk with Hennecke who reluctaly gives her a drink. She tells him that her father has killed himself but she forgot what else her mother told her. Hennecke tells her to have another drink and forget about the whole thing. Who has a family these days he says. He tells her to get back to singing, but she of course cannot go on after hearing the news. She cannot let her mother down. Hennecke believes she is too soft for the business, Corinna argrees.Emma comes home to find a group of photographers taking pictures and asking Helene and Ernst questions about Hermann. The two explain how average and normal Hermann was as each had a good relationship with him. They explain how Hermann was the quiet type and never picked quarells. A reporter asks Ernst if his father ever beat him as a child and Ernst answers yes. As the two are interviewed, Emma stirs stew in the kitchen. A reporter finds Emma and begins to ask her questions. Emma agrees to meet with the reporter on the following day as her head is empty. Another man, Karl, comes in and tells Emma to keep her chin up. Karl steps outside with a woman, Marianne, and walks down the street. They speak of the photographers who represent tabloids and newspapers only out to exploit the murder. Karl, however, is only interested in the truth.The photographer is back with Emma, taking pictures and asking her questions as he directs her to perform actions for the camera. Emma stirs a pot and works on the electrical outlets as the photographer asks questions about Hermann. Emma explains that Hermann was a drinker, but not an alcoholic. Emma is then told to make the bed as the photographer takes more pictures. Emma tells him that Hermann used to give the kids and her a beating when they upset him. But he would always calm down and get quiet. Lastly, Emma is then instructed to hold a recent picture of her husband. She finds one of him at the zoo, taken three weeks earlier. She begins to cry as she remembers the frequent Sunday trips to the zoo. The photographer asks Emma to turn and face the camera as she weeps holding the picture in her hand. The photographer is pleased with the image. A telegram arrives from Corinna who will be arriving at the airport at 10:00. Interested in the fact that Emma also has a daughter, the photographer offers to give Emma a ride to the airport to meet with Corinna.
Emma meets with Corinna at the airport, they embrace as the photographer continues to take pictures. He then introduces himself to Corinna as Niemeyer, a reporter. They drive back into town and continue to talk about Hermanns death. Niemeyer tells the two women how touched he is about Hermanns death. Emma explains how she still has not read any newspapers as she fears they will say nasty things about his death. Emma insists on Hermann being a good man. Niemeyer promises the two he will report as objectively as possible. Emma thanks him. Niemeyer then offers to take the two women to lunch as he is very interested in Corinna, who seems very willing to answer all of Niemeyers questions.At a Japanese restrauraunt, Niemeyer asks Corinna about her childhood. Corinna explains how hard-off her childhood was and that she left right after high school to study. Hermann and her brother Ernst, she explains, never approved of her studying. She says that fate led her to become a singer/songwriter. Corinna excuses herself from the table and Niemeyer watches her as she walks away. Alone, Corinna calls the editor of the murder case and explains that she is the daughter of the murderer. Emma is seen in the background watching Corinna as she talks on the phone. Corinna explains that her latest hit song, Men? Who Cares About Them? She also tells the editor that she is interested in talking to him. She then goes back to the table where Niemeyer agrees with Corinna to me at 8:00.Back at the house, Emma tries to convince Helene and Ernst not to go on vacation. Helene and Ernst argue that they cannot back out of the trip as they have already invested too much money into the vacation. They also agree that they must think about the baby. Corinna comes in and argues with Helene about her singing career. Corinna dresses and speaks with her brother Ernst, still in shock over their fathers sudden change in personality. A doorbell rings and Corinna leaves. Ernst asks Helene if they should stay with Emma, but Helene disagrees. She accuses Ernst of not taking her side.At the funeral, Niemeyer continues to take pictures. Very few people are at Hermanns funeral. Only a couple family members and a group of photographers taking pictures for their reports remain after the casket is lowered. Corinna looks up to see Niemeyer, who looks back and snap a few pictures. Corinna poses for the photographers over the grave and drops a bouquet of roses. Corinna is then interviewed by several of the photographers questioning about her future as a singer. They ask if her fathers death has helped or hindered her career, in which she does not have an answer. Though the reporter points out that her popularity has increased significantly since Hermanns death. Corinna says she will continue to focus on her art and will possibily perform in Frankfurt in the near future. Karl and Marianne appear and comfort Emma, asking her to have coffee with them.
At Marianne and Karls house, Emma is served coffee and speaks to Marianne about Hermanns death. After years of nothing, overnight, everything comes crashing down on you. Karl comes in and insists that there is a lesson to be learned in all of this. Karl tells Emma that what Hermann did was actually considered in a sense, revolutionary despite the papers calling him crazy. Karl argues that Hermanns problem is a problem of all workers. Only when they are strong and united can changes occur says Karl. A killing, however, does not help the cause. Emma says that she never felt Hermann to be oppressed by any means. Karl then argues that there doesnt need to be a society of servants and masters, but a Socialist society where everyone works together as a unit. Marianne then points out that factories all around Germany are making small profits for what they sell, and the business owners are reaping most of the money. The Capitalists are consuming the profits and that is unjust, she says. When there is a crisis, the Capitalist push the burden onto the workers and therefore they are fired or laid off. Karl and Marianne argue that Hermann did not want to accept this truth and took action, but in the wrong manner. Emma states that Hermann was always one to think of others first over himself. Karl takes a drink before declaring his and Mariannes true identities as Communists. Emma thanks the two for their company and leaves. They both tell Emma that she is welcome back anytime. Niemeyer and Corinna are seen in bed together. Corinna is then seen back at her mothers house, as Emma explains the meeting she had with the two Communists. Corinna is unsure about Karl and Marianne, but Emma assures her that they are good people.Back at Karl and Mariannes, they speak of Emma. Marianne think they scared her off with their wild Communist theories, though Karl thinks otherwise. They hope to use Emma to their partys benefit.Corinna and Niemeyer are at a local bar watching a man dressed as a woman performs on stage. The owner says that pretty much anyone can perform here as long as they have some musical ability. The main thing is that the audience is interested and drinks a lot. The owner recognizes Corinna as the daughter of the murderer and asks if she is OK with it. She agrees to perform.
Back at the house, Corinna is using the typewriter while Emma reads the newspaper aloud. A light melody plays in the background. The paper describes Hermann as a drunkard and a tyrant who beat his family and haggard, aged wife. The article then mentions Corinna in a positive light, as she wanted to study even though her father did not agree with it. Emma is upset with Niemeyers article as it did not present the truth as he said it would. Corinna defends Niemeyer, saying that he was just trying to do his job. Emma is upset with Corinna and Niemeyer, swearing to call them to account for their mistakes.Emma visits the pension office to discuss the death of her husband. A man, Mr Holzapfel, explains to Emma that since his murder was no accident and that he did indeed kill a man, Dr Berthold, during the incident, Emma has no legal claim. Back home, Corinna is packing to move out. Emma is upset, because she feels as if everyone is deserting her, especially in her time of need. Emma begins to cry as she realizes Corinna is moving in with Niemeyer.Emma is in a phone booth speaking to Karl. She wants to come by and talk as she feels all alone. Karl is excited that Emma is coming by. Emma agrees, hangs up the phone, and enters the subway station.Marianne greets Emma at the door as shows her inside. Marianne makes coffee as Karl asks to show Emma something. Emma sits down and Karl pulls out his newspaper in which he has written an article about Hermanns case. Karl wants Emma to compare Niemeyers story with his. Emma agrees that Niemeyers article was terrible. She calls Niemeyer a filthy swin and an animal. Karl asks Emma to read his article. Emma likes his article much better, though she realizes not many people will read it as it is a Communist newspaper. Emma thanks Karl for writing the article and Karl claims it was his duty to write the truth. Back at the house, Ernst drinks and tells his mother about the horrible vacation to Finland. Helene is upset with Ernst who was lazy the entire trip. Emma supports her son for relaxing. Helene gets upset as she always feels ganged by the mother and son duo, she threatens to move out. Helene calls a couple ads in the newspaper looking for a furnished apartment for three. Emma is upset with both Helene and Ernst and asks them to move out, as she will be better off on her own. The door bell rings, its Corinna who comes in to pick up some stuff she forgot. She asks Ernst and Emma to come to watch her sing in Frankfurt. They agree.At the show, the announcer expresses his wonder for Corinnas powerful voice. Along with Emma and Ernst, Niemeyer watches from the crowd. The announcer then introduces the sensation as the daughter of the factory murderer. Emma cant believe it. Corinna comes out and sings a very depressing song. Niemeyer takes more pictures as Corinna sings. As Corinna ends her song and the audience claps, Emma cries and leaves with Ernst. Again at the house, Ernst and Emma work on the electrical outlets. Helene brags about the apartment she has found. Ernst leaves Emma alone at the table to help Helene pack.Emma visits Marianne and Karl once again. Marianne invites her in for sandwiches. Emma tells Marianne her troubles of living alone. Karl comes down the stairs and invites Emma to come along with them to meet some comrades.Emma sits at the table assembling the small electrical outlets by herself. The door bell rings, its Ernst, who asks to come in. The baby has been born and has been keeping him up at night. He sits and helps his mother. She tells him that she has joined the German Communist Party along with Karl and Marianne. She tells Ernst that she is beginning to understand why Hermann did the things he did. Ernst is happy to see his mother progressing; he leaves to return to Helene and the baby.Emma attends a Communist Party meeting in which Karl speaks to the audience. Karl talks about the struggle of the working class and Socialism. The audience applauds after Karls speech. Another man stands up and introduces Emma to the audience, who will also make a speech. Emma explains that she never has spoken to such a large crowd, though she will try her best. She explains that not everything is God-given or of fate, but theres a reason for everything terrible that happens in the world. She explains how she thought she knew Hermann, but apparently she did not, even after 40 years of marriage. How can we really know anyone, she asks. She claims that her husband was not a murderer or a crazy person and that the magazines are filled with nothing but lies. He is a man who hit back, because he was beaten all his life. A camera and tape recorder captures Emma on the stand as the audience applauds. Emma walks out and a man, Horst Knab, greets her. He tells her that he appreciated her speech, though the people in the room are using her for the wrong reasons. He says that the Party is all talk and no action. He tells Emma that she needs to take action to bring them out of their sleep. Horst leaves a confused Emma.After the meeting, Emma walks with Marianne and Karl down a sidewalk at night. Marianne tells Emma that the party members were very impressed and touched by her speech. Emma then tells the two that she was approached by Horst who told her she needed to take an action. Karl tells Emma that Horst is one who wishes to destroy, rather than build and he does not even talk with Horst anymore. He describes Horsts group as anarchists and enemies of the Communist movement. They walk Emma to her home and say goodnight. Marianne warns Karl that he promised Emma too much. Emma looks back at the two as if he heard what they said.Emma meets with Marianne and Karl, upset that the party has not taken any action in helping her with Hermanns image and rehabilitation. She wonders why the truth has not been revealed to the people. Karl assures her that it is a slow process and she must be patient. Emma becomes angry, wanting to act now, but Karl tells her that they are very busy at the moment with an election campaign. Karl says the partys main task is to gain more voters. Emma leaves disappointed.Back at the house she continues to assemble electrical sockets, Horst is there. Horst tells her that her party is small with limited power and courage. Horst tells her that his party is free of rules and constitutions. Though their group is even smaller than the Communists, they make up for it with spirit and guts. He suggests going to the editorial office with Emma and 4 or 5 others and sitting on the floor until their demands are met. Emma tells him shell think it over.Emma, Horst, a few others walk up the stairs of the editorial office demanding to speak with Niemeyer. The woman tells them that Niemeyer is not there and that the editor is in a meeting. Horst tells her to pull him out of the meeting as they have important information. Dr. Linke comes out and greets the group. Emma introduces herself as Mrs. Kusters. Linke recognizes her name and Horst steps into the conversation. Horst accuses Linke of defamation to Hermanns and the Kusters name. Emma demands Linke to reprint the truth about her husband. Linke tells Emma that a retraction cannot be made every time someone complains. He suggests Emma write a readers letter, but she declines as she cannot wait any longer. Linke asks the group to leave. Horst pulls out a gun and puts it up to Linke, another member pulls out an automatic weapon. Emma cannot believe it. Horst declares that everyone in the office is a hostage. Horst orders Linke to call Niemeyer. The phone rings at Niemeyers apartment, he sits reading the paper while Corinna paints her toenails, half-naked in the background. Niemeyer hangs up the phone telling Corinna that her mother and some anarchists have taken hostages at the editorial office. Corinna doesnt believe that her mother is with them. Niemeyer leaves as Corinna sits confused.Back at the office, Horst is on the phone calling themselves the Kusters Kommandos. He tells the person on the phone that the hostages will be shot if their demands are not met. Horst demands restitution for the article written about a lone revolutionary, Hermann Kusters. In Hermanns honor, Horst demands the release of all political prisons held captive in the Federal Republic of Germany. Horst hangs up. The phone rings again, its the chief of police. Horst demands free passage with the hostages in a Mercedes 600. Also, he wants a Boeing 707 with a crew of four ready for takeoff to leave the country. Before hanging up the phone he finishes with long live the revolution. Niemeyer arrives asking Emma to stop the war games. Horst orders Niemeyer against the wall with the others. The phone rings again. Horst answers and says that they will take Linke and Niemeyer as hostages once the car arrives. If the car is not there within one hour, a hostage will be shot.The film ends with titles. Apparently, the German version does not have the final scenes so the director, Fassbinder, had to insert titles in their place.In the German version, the group goes outside to the waiting car. People and police surround the borders. Ernst sees his mother and breaks through the barrier. He runs to her. Just then, Emma is shot and falls to the ground. Horst shoots and kills Linke, before he is shot by police. Corinna runs to her mothers side as she lies dead in the street. Corinna poses for a picture lying next to her dead mother."
tt0073440,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Music']","The overarching plot takes place over five days leading up to a political rally for Replacement Party candidate Hal Phillip Walker, who is never seen throughout the entire movie. The story follows 24 characters roaming around Nashville, in search of some sort of goal through their own (often overlapping) story arcs.Day OneThe film opens with a campaign van for presidential candidate Hal Phillip Walker driving around Nashville as an external loudspeaker blares Walker's folksy political aphorisms and vaguely anti-establishment populism. This is juxtaposed with country superstar Haven Hamilton (Henry Gibson) recording an overblown patriotic song (""200 Years"") intended to commemorate the upcoming Bicentennial, and growing irritated with the accompanying musicians in the studio. A young Englishwoman named Opal (Geraldine Chaplin), who claims to be working on a radio documentary for the BBC, appears in the studio but is told to leave by Haven. Down the hall from Haven's session is Linnea Reese (Lily Tomlin), a white gospel singer recording a song with a black choir.Later that day, the beloved country singer Barbara Jean (Ronee Blakley) is returning to Nashville, having recovered from a burn accident, and the elite of Nashville's music scene, including Haven Hamilton and his companion Lady Pearl (Barbara Baxley), have converged on Berry Field to greet her plane as it arrives. Also present are Pfc. Glenn Kelly (Scott Glenn) and the folk/rock trio ""Bill, Mary, and Tom"" whose catchy hit song ""It Don't Worry Me"" seems to be on everybody's lips. They are in town to record their second album. Bill (Allan F. Nicholls) and Mary (Cristina Raines) are married, but largely unhappy, partly due to the fact that Mary is in love with womanizing Tom (Keith Carradine).Meanwhile, Mr. Green (Keenan Wynn) arrives at the airport to pick up his niece, Martha (Shelley Duvall), who has renamed herself ""L.A. Joan"", a teenage groupie who has come to Nashville ostensibly to visit her aunt Esther Green who is sick in the hospital. However, Martha repeatedly puts off visiting her aunt in favor of chasing after musicians or pretty much any male she comes across, including the oddball motorcyclist known as ""Tricycle Man,"" (Jeff Goldblum). Working at the airport restaurant are African-American cook Wade Cooley (Robert DoQui), and his pretty waitress friend, Sueleen Gay (Gwen Welles), an aspiring country singer who refuses to recognize that she can't carry a tune.After greeting the crowds on the tarmac, Barbara Jean faints due to the heat, and her handlers, headed by her domineering husband-manager Barnett (Allen Garfield), rush her to the hospital. Barbara Jean's appearance having been cut short, those in attendance depart the airport in a rush, and wind up stranded on the highway after a pile-up occurs. During the commotion, Winifred (Barbara Harris), an aspiring country singer who has chosen the stage name ""Albuquerque,"" runs away from her husband, Star (Bert Remsen), after he refuses to take her to the Grand Ole Opry. Star gives a ride to Kenny Frasier (David Hayward), a nondescript, bespectacled young man who has just arrived in town carrying a violin case. Opal takes advantage of the traffic jam to interview first Linnea and then Tommy Brown (Timothy Brown), an African-American country singer who is performing at the Opry. Tommy and his entourage later go to Lady Pearl's nightclub, but Wade, who is drinking and trying to pick up white girls at the bar, insults Tommy for acting too ""white"" and starts a fight.Linnea's husband, Del Reese (Ned Beatty) is working with political organizer John Triplette (Michael Murphy) to plan a small fundraiser and a large outdoor concert gala for the Walker campaign. Sueleen appears at a local club's open mike night in a provocative outfit, and despite her lack of singing ability, club manager Trout (Merle Kilgore) recommends her to Triplette for the fundraiser based on her appearance. Winifred shows up at Trout's club trying to recruit musicians to record a demo with her, but Star sees her and chases her out. Del invites Triplette for a family dinner with Linnea and their two deaf children. Linnea and Del are having communications problems and she focuses on the children rather than on him. In the middle of dinner, Tom calls trying to make a date with Linnea, but she puts him off, so he takes Opal back to his room instead. Pfc. Kelly sneaks into Barbara Jean's hospital room and sits in the chair by her bed all night, watching her sleep.Day TwoTom calls Linnea again but, with Del listening on the other line, Linnea yells at Tom and tells him not to call her any more. Kenny rents a room from Mr. Green. Haven Hamilton throws a pre-show party at his house before the evening's Grand Ole Opry performance. At the party, Opal talks to Haven's son Bud (Dave Peel) who tells her, unconvincingly, that he is happy to act as his father's business manager and has no musical ambitions of his own. Under Opal's prodding, Bud starts to sing her a song he wrote, a tender love ballad, but Opal departs in a rush when she spots a movie star among the guests. Lady Pearl talks about her love for John and Bobby Kennedy, the only politicians she ever admired. Triplette tries to persuade Haven to perform at the Walker gala by telling him that if Walker is elected, Walker would back Haven for Governor of Tennessee. Haven says he'll give Triplette his decision after the Opry show that night.At Opryland USA, the Grand Ole Opry broadcast begins with Tommy Brown (""Bluebird"") and Haven Hamilton (""For the Sake of the Children"", ""Keep a-Goin""). Haven then introduces Connie White (Karen Black) as a substitute for the hospitalized Barbara Jean. Connie sings ""Memphis"" and ""I Don't Know If I Found It in You"" while Barbara Jean and Barnett listen morosely on the radio in her hospital room. Winifred tries unsuccessfully to get backstage. Barbara Jean and Barnett have an argument because he is going to the after-show gathering to thank Connie for substituting at the last minute. Barbara Jean doesn't want him to go, and he suggests in an accusatory tone that she may be headed for another nervous breakdown. Barnett finally calms down Barbara Jean and goes to the after-party at a nightclub, but Connie doesn't seem happy to see him. Connie takes the stage (""Rolling Stone"") but the disgruntled Barnett criticizes her performance. Lady Pearl regales Opal with stories about the Kennedy brothers, rendering Opal for once speechless. Haven tells Triplette that Barbara Jean and Connie never appear on the same stage, and that he (Haven) will appear anyplace Barbara Jean also appears. Bill gets upset when his wife Mary doesn't show up all evening, and he confesses to chauffeur Norman (David Arkin), that he suspects her of having an affair. Mary, in bed with Tom, keeps whispering ""I Love You,"" but Tom doesn't respond.Day ThreeIt is Sunday morning and the characters are shown attending various local church services. A Roman Catholic service includes Lady Pearl, Wade and Sueleen; Haven Hamilton sings in the choir at a Protestant service; and Linnea is seen in the choir at a black Protestant church as a baptism is taking place, with Tommy Brown in the pews. At the hospital chapel, Barbara Jean sings a hymn from her wheelchair while Mr. Green and Pfc. Kelly, among others, watch. Mr. Green tells Kelly how he and his wife lost their son in WWII. Opal wanders alone through a huge auto scrap yard making free-form poetic speeches about the cars into her tape recorder. Haven, Tommy Brown and their families attend the stock car races, where Winifred attempts to sing on a small stage but cannot be heard over the cars. Bill and Mary argue in their hotel room and are interrupted by Triplette, who wants to recruit them for the Walker concert gala. Tom tries to get Norman to score him some pills.Day FourOpal walks alone through a large school bus parking lot trying to spin a commentary linking the buses to racism in the South, but has trouble hitting the right note. Barbara Jean is discharged from the hospital at the same time Mr. Green shows up to visit his sick wife. Barbara Jean asks after Mrs. Green and sends her regards. After Barbara Jean and her entourage have left, a nurse tells Mr. Green his wife died earlier that morning. Pfc. Kelly tells Mr. Green why he has been following Barbara Jean around; his mother saved Barbara Jean's life in the fire and loved her more than anything. She asked her son to go see Barbara Jean on his leave from Vietnam service. Back at Mr. Green's house, Kenny gets upset when Martha tries to look at his violin case.Barbara Jean performs a matinee at Opryland USA. Triplette and Del attend and try to convince Barnett to have Barbara Jean play the Walker concert gala at the Parthenon the next day, but he refuses. Kenny and Pfc. Kelly are both in the audience and watch raptly as Barbara Jean sings, although Opal annoyingly tries to interview Kelly about Vietnam during a song. Barbara Jean gets through the first couple of songs (""Tapedeck in his Tractor"", ""Dues"") all right, but then begins to tell rambling stories about her childhood instead of starting the next song. After several false starts, Barnett escorts her from the stage and tells the disappointed audience that they can come to the Parthenon tomorrow and see Barbara Jean perform for free, thus committing her to the Walker concert.Tom calls Linnea and invites her to meet him that night at a club called the Exit Inn. Linnea arrives but sits by herself because Martha is trying to pick up Tom. Mary and Bill are also there, and Opal sits with them and mentions that she slept with Tom, causing Mary to look away in humiliation. Wade tries unsuccessfully to pick up Linnea, while Norman tries equally unsuccessfully to pick up Opal. Tom is introduced as a surprise guest artist. He casually mentions that he ""used to be in a trio,"" but then invites Bill and Mary up to the stage, where the three perform an uncomfortable rendition of ""Since You're Gone"". Again alone on the stage, Tom introduces his new solo number, ""I'm Easy,"" which he dedicates to someone special in the audience. Mary, Opal, and Martha all hope that they are the one, but Tom only has eyes for Linnea. She goes to his room where they make love. When Linnea says she has to go, Tom begs her to stay another hour, and is visibly miffed when she refuses. Without even waiting for her to get dressed and leave, Tom grabs the phone and calls a girlfriend in New York, inviting her to fly down and join him.Sueleen appears at the all-male Walker fundraiser, but is booed off the stage when she sings poorly and doesn't take off her clothes. Del and Triplette explain to her that the men expect her to strip and that if she does so, they will let her sing the next day at the Parthenon with Barbara Jean. Sueleen is humiliated, but strips anyway. Winifred shows up at the fundraiser hoping to get a chance to sing, but after she sees what is going on, she stays hidden behind a curtain. Del drives Sueleen home and drunkenly comes on to her, but she is rescued by Wade. After he hears what happened, Wade tells Sueleen the truth, that she can't sing, and asks her to go back to Detroit with him the next day. Sueleen refuses because she is determined to sing at the Parthenon with Barbara Jean.Day FiveThe performers, audience and Walker and his entourage arrive for the Parthenon concert; Walker will wait in his limousine until his speech after the musical performances. In the performing lineup are Haven, Barbara Jean, Linnea and her choir, Bill, Mary and Tom, and Sueleen. Winifred has shown up again hoping for a chance to sing. Barnett gets upset because Barbara Jean will have to perform in front of a large Walker advertisement, but has to go along with it because his wife's career will be harmed if he pulls her out of another show. Mr. Green and Kenny attend Esther Green's burial service and Mr. Green leaves angrily, vowing to find Martha (who is not at the service) and make her show some respect to her aunt. Mr. Green and Kenny go to the Parthenon to look for Martha.The Walker gala starts and Haven and Barbara Jean perform a song together (""One, I Love You""), then Barbara Jean sings a very personal solo song about her childhood (""My Idaho Home""). As the song ends, gunshots are heard. Kenny has pulled a gun from his violin case and fired at the performers, grazing Haven and seriously wounding Barbara Jean. Pfc. Kelly disarms Kenny as chaos breaks out. Barbara Jean is carried bleeding and unconscious from the stage. Haven tries to calm the crowd by exhorting them to sing, asserting that ""This isn't Dallas, this is Nashville"" in reference to the JFK assassination. As he is led from the stage for treatment of his wounds, Haven hands the microphone off to Winifred, who tentatively begins to sing ""It Don't Worry Me."" As she is joined by Linnea's gospel choir, Winifred's confidence grows until all eyes are upon her. The film ends with the audience clapping and dancing as Winifred belts out the chorus, ""You may say that I'm not free, but it don't worry me."" She has finally gotten her big break."
tt0073453,"['Crime', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","Four men in the movie stunt business join together to smuggle precious Mexican antiquities to the States. All are pilots except for mechanic Quentin (James Woods). One of the pilots, Tom Iverson (John Crawford), also has a charter business in the Florida Keys, used as a staging point for the smuggled goods. Iverson's girlfriend Paula (Jennifer Warren) is also in on the scheme. All of this occurs before the movie opens; all that follows happens during the film.Los Angeles private eye and former NFL player Harry Moseby (Gene Hackman) arrives at the Keys searching for Iverson's runaway, nymphet stepdaughter Delly (Melanie Griffith). Moseby was hired by Arlene Iverson, Tom's selfish ex-wife and a former actress. Arlene's only means of support is Delly, Arlene's daughter by her first husband.After Moseby takes the case, he discovers that his wife is cheating on him, but instead of talking to his wife Ellen (Susan Clark), he accosts the man she has been seeing, Marty Heller (Harris Yulin). Marty despises Harry for acting like a private eye instead of taking care of his own marital problems. Although they eventually reconcile, Ellen also despises Harry for treating her like a case subject instead of his wife.As Moseby follows the clues to Delly, he makes fast friends with stunt director Joey Ziegler (Ed Binns) who is keen to help Moseby find Delly. Moseby discovers that Quentin and stunt flier Marv Ellman (another smuggler) were both once involved with, and fought over, Delly, although Moseby has no suspicion of the other motives and machinations occurring under his nose. Moseby eventually finds Delly with Iverson and Paula in the Keys, and they allow Moseby to stay for a while as he tries to convince Delly to come back to L.A. with him.During a boating trip one night with Delly and Paula, they find Ellman's downed plane. Paula deceives Moseby about a marker she places at the crash, saying it is for the Coast Guard. It is really for Iverson who will come to the site later and retrieve the stolen goods from Ellman's plane. During this time, Paula seduces Harry to keep him occupied. Delly eventually comes back to L.A. with Moseby, finding Quentin waiting for her at Arlene's home.It is the last time Moseby sees Delly alive, with everyone at the house yelling at one another other while Harry drives away, not reflecting on the turmoil he has once again introduced into Delly's life.Arlene gets Delly some movie extra work but she dies in a car crash during a stunt in which Ziegler was driving, who lived but was badly injured. Moseby views film footage of Quentin under the car before the stunt and begins to suspect Quentin murdered Delly. Moseby confronts Quentin and accuses him of killing Delly because she discovered he killed Ellman out of jealousy. They fight but Quentin escapes. Moseby then tells Ziegler he thinks Quentin and Iverson are in on something but he doesn't know what. Moseby goes back to the Keys to find out.Moseby arrives at Iverson's charter business to find Quentin dead. Moseby then confronts Iverson who confesses to killing Quentin. Quentin thought Iverson killed Ellman to get a larger share of the smuggling proceeds, and Moseby had scared Quentin into thinking he was going to go down for Ellman's murder instead. Moseby struggles with Iverson and knocks him out, then is determined to finish things by having Paula help him locate the stolen artifacts.They find the marker previously left, and while Paula is underwater, a seaplane strafes the boat and Harry is injured. The plane lands and sees Paula surface along with a large stone sculpture. The plane runs her down but then collides with the sculpture, kicking out its pontoons. The plane then flies into the boat and begins to sink. Harry tries to get a glimpse of the pilot from the diving window built into the boat's keel: it is Ziegler, the last person he ever suspected.The movie ends with Harry unsuccessfully trying to steer the boat to shore - he succeeds only in going in circles."
tt0073486,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'R']","In 1963 Oregon, Randle Patrick McMurphy (Nicholson), a criminal who has been sentenced to a fairly short prison term, decides to have himself declared insane so he'll be transferred to a mental institution, where he expects to serve the rest of his term free of prison labor and in (comparative) comfort and luxury.His ward in the mental institution is run by an unyielding tyrant, Nurse Ratched (Fletcher), who has cowed the patients (most of whom are ""voluntary"" or there by choice) into dejected institutionalized submission. McMurphy becomes ensnared in a number of power games with Nurse Ratched for the hearts and minds of the patients. All the time, however, the question is just how sane any of the players in the ward actually are and whether they really belong there.Throughout his stay at the hospital, McMurphy forms friendships with his fellow patients but the bonds are deepest with two in particular: Billy Bibbit (Dourif), a suicidal, stuttering manchild whom Ratched has humiliated and dominated into a quivering mess; and ""Chief"" Bromden (Sampson), a 6'5"" muscular Native American who has schizophrenia. Recognized by the patients in the ward as deaf, and unable to speak, they ignore him but also respect him for his enormous size. In the former, McMurphy sees a younger brother figure whom he wants to teach to have fun, while the latter is his only real confidant, as they both understand what it is like to be treated into submission.McMurphy initially insults Chief when he enters the ward, but attempts to use his size as an advantage (for example, in playing basketball, for which his height is favorable). When Mac sees how submissive the patients are under Ratched's tyrannical control, he resolves to antagonize her and undermine her authority as much as possible. At a counseling session, McMurphy proposes that the ward's work schedule be altered so that the patients can watch the World Series on television. When the 1st meeting comes to a halt under Ratched's authority, Mac takes wagers on whether he can lift the ward's marble water-treatment control panel and throw it through a window to escape and watch the Series at a bar. He naturally fails, but puts forth an extreme effort.The next discussion over changing the work detail quickly becomes a battle of wills when Ratched announces that a majority vote will be acceptable. However, Ratched, upon realizing that the vote may go McMurphy's way, deftly alters the rules, stating that votes must be taken from the Chronic and Vegetable patients . When the vote doesn't favor McMurphy, he begins to imagine the game is on TV and rallies most of the other patients behind him, causing a major ruckus.McMurphy leads the patients in a basketball game against the ward's orderlies. Chief Bromden proves to be an effective player, scoring several baskets. While the orderlies claim that the patients are cheating, McMurphy ignores their objections. While the patients later relax in the hospital pool, Mac finds out, from an orderly, that he won't be released at the end of his prison sentence, but will remain in the hospital for as long as the board and Ratched deem necessary.Another counseling session ensues and McMurphy, very upset at the orderly's revelation, finds out that he's been listed as a ""committed"" patient and will only be released when Ratched permits it, a highly unlikely scenario. Murphy also discovers that many of the patients in the ward are there voluntarily: they can leave any time they wish but due to Ratched's dominance, they are afraid to take the chance. McMurphy seems particularly upset that a young man like Billy remains on the ward voluntarily when he could be free and maybe enjoying his youth.The session quickly erupts in violence however, when the subject of Ratched's cigarette rationing is addressed by an upset patient named Charlie Cheswick. Nearly all the patients who play cards have lost money to McMurphy after he introduces them to Blackjack, prompting Ratched to ration their cigarettes. When Taber is burned by a lit cigarette and reacts loudly and violently and is dragged away, Ratched tries to restore order. Charlie suddenly becomes confrontational as well and a fight breaks out with the orderlies and Mac, Bromden (who'd pulled one of the orderlies off Mac) and Cheswick are sent to a detention area where electro-convulsive therapy is conducted on disruptive patients. Cheswick is sent first to undergo ECT, while McMurphy and Chief wait on the bench. In the few moments they have alone, McMurphy offers Chief a piece of gum, and Chief verbally thanks him. A surprised McMurphy realizes that Chief can speak and hear him and has feigned his illness the whole time. McMurphy resolves to allow Chief in on his escape plan because of his hidden wisdom. Ending this scene, a more defiant McMurphy emerges from the detention area to an awaiting Nurse Ratched. Mac appears submissive, claiming he'll happily join the group again.Closer to Christmas McMurphy, fed up with Ratched's oppressive methods, sneaks into the nurse's station and calls his girlfriend, Candy, to bring booze and assist in his escape. She brings a girlfriend, and both enter the ward when McMurphy convinces the ward's night attendant, Mr. Turkle, to open one of the ward's secured windows. The patients drink heavily, while Billy flirts with McMurphy's girlfriend. The party becomes very loud, drawing the attention of Turkle's supervisor. Turkle hides them all in Ratched's office until he's able to convince the supervisor that only Candy is hiding in the office.The party goes on. Later in the evening, when McMurphy and the Chief plan to finally leave, Billy, upset at Mac's departure, hints to Mac that he wants a date with Candy. Billy and Candy are given a private room and Mac boosts Billy's confidence & allows him to have sex with her. McMurphy, however, while waiting (believing the encounter will be quick), falls asleep with the rest of the patients.Nurse Ratched and the orderlies arrive in the morning to discover the patients asleep and hung over and the ward and her office trashed. Though clearly upset and angry, she calmly commands the orderlies to lock the open window, escort Candy's friend out of the hospital and conduct a head count. When they discover that one patient, Billy, is missing, Ratched demands the others to reveal his whereabouts. Billy is discovered with Candy, who is immediately led out of the hospital.Ratched demands that Billy tell him who allowed him to have sex with Candy. Billy, his stutter noticeably gone, tells her that McMurphy did, and that the rest of the ward encouraged him. A passively angry Ratched then threatens to tell Billy's mother, citing her long-time friendship with her. Billy's stutter returns very quickly and, very upset, begs Ratched not to tell his mother. When she explains that he should have thought of the consequences, he breaks down into tears and is dragged away to Dr. Spivey's office, screaming. McMurphy, still in possession of Turkle's keys, unlocks one of the windows and is about to escape when Ratched's nurse assistant, Miss Pilbro, screams loudly.McMurphy and everyone else rush to Spivey's office where Billy had been led to. Having been left alone momentarily, he commited suicide, using a jagged piece of glass to slit his throat. After McMurphy sees what the ward has done to his friend and hears Ratched's orders for everyone to remain calm and return to their routine, he explodes into a violent rage, strangling Nurse Ratched until she is near death. She survives, but McMurphy is knocked unconscious by one of the orderlies and taken off the ward.Rumors float around the ward of McMurphy's fate. Some believe he'd escaped, others seem to know he was lobotomized. Late one night, McMurphy is quietly returned to his bed by orderlies. The Chief sneaks over to Mac's bed and finds him unresponsive; he also sees two scars on Mac's forehead, indicating that he'd been lobotomized. Unwilling to leave McMurphy behind, the Chief suffocates his vegetable-like friend with a pillow. He lifts the heavy marble hydrotherapy fountain that Mac was unable to before and, hurling it through a barred window, escapes to Canada."
tt0073540,"['Drama', 'Mystery']","The film begins in a (fictional) English girls' school in the Australian bush on February 14, 1900. The school is headed by Mrs. Appleyard (Rachel Roberts), an indomitable and unbending figure of authority. Her staff include the remote mathematics mistress Miss Greta McCraw (Vivean Gray), said to have a 'masculine' intellect; the young and beautiful Mademoiselle de Portiers (Helen Morse) who teaches French and deportment, and the jittery Miss Lumley (Kirsty Child), who is anxious to please Mrs. Appleyard.Amid lingering images of white-clad girls in whispering voices delighting in Valentine's cards, the character of Miranda (Anne-Louise Lambert) and her friend and admirer, Sara (Margaret Nelson) are introduced. Miranda's circle of friends includes Irma (Karen Robson), Marion (Jane Vallis), Rosamund (Ingrid Mason). Sara's affection for Miranda clearly stems from a deep romantic crush. Another pupil, Edith (Christine Schuler) hovers on the edge of Miranda's circle, desperate for acceptance. Sara, an orphan who is a kind of charity pupil, is disliked by Mrs. Appleyard, and is not allowed to join the outing, ostensibly because she has not memorized an assigned poem. Miranda shows worry that Sara dotes on her too much in which she tells Sara that she ""won't be here much longer"" (suggesting a premonition of her disappearance). The party leaves leaving behind Mrs. Appleyard and Sara.The girls ride to Hanging Rock, a 500-foot tall volcanic rock formation about 11 km northeast of the school. Mlle. de Portiers and Miss McCraw are the supervisors. Mr. Hussey drives the girls in his wagon on the trip to the formation. For some odd reason, everyone's timepiece and wristwatch stops at 12 noon when they arrive. Miranda cuts a cake in honor of St. Valentine and the party relaxes in the warm shade.Marion asks permission to take Miranda and Irma for an excursion on the rock and is accompanied by Edith. Their departure is witnessed by a fascinated young Englishman who attempts to follow them, but soon breaks away. After a brief nap (or swoon) on a plateau, they get up, and seemingly under a spell, three of them advance as one toward an inner recess, witnessed by Edith, who cries out to them not to go. She screams and runs downward. One of the teachers, Miss McCraw, leaves the picnic unnoticed and begins to climb the rock.Although the party was due back at about eight o'clock, it is 10:30 p.m. and after dark when Mr. Hussey's wagon arrives back at the school, where they tell Mrs. Appleyard about the mysterious disappearance. Edith remains hysterical and unable to explain what has transpired only that she saw Miss McCraw heading up toward the plateau without her skirt. The police investigation led by Sgt. Bumpher (Wyn Roberts) and Constable Jones (Garry McDonald) leads them to a young Englishman, Michael Fitzhubert (Dominic Guard) who was lunching at the rock with his family, his uncle Colonel Fitzhubert (Peter Collingwood) and Mrs. Fitzhubert (Olga Dickie). Michael, with Albert (John Jarratt), the Fitzhubert party's young local Australian valet, spent part of the lunch watching the picnic, but offer no clues in the investigation. Sara is devastated, but habitually treated coldly as the orphan she is by the teachers and students alike.The nearby town of Woodend quickly becomes restless as news of the disappearance spreads. The townsfolk are angry, demanding answers. Michael, who becomes obsessed with finding Miranda, gets Albert to accompany him to the Rock for another search after another search turned up nothing. The next morning, Albert travels up to the rock and finds a nearly delirious Michael whom he helps back down to the ground. Albert follows Michael's trail and discovers Irma, unconscious but unharmed.At the Fitzhubert home where Irma is treated for dehydration and exposure, she tells the police investigator that she has no memory of what happened on the rock, or of the fate of her companions.

During the presentation, Helga reacts violently to a premonition of a ""twisted mind"" and she says ""you have killed, and you will kill again!"" Helga also mentions a singing child. Someone in the audience gets up a leaves. Later, Helga tells Giordani that she may know who the killer is and that she will write it down and tell him tomorrow.At Helga's apartment, she is on the phone with her German publisher when she hangs up after hearing a children's song being played in the background. A minute later, the front doorbell rings. Helga gets up to answer it when she has a bad psychic vibe and backs away from the door. Just then the door bursts open and the killer (unseen except for wearing a brown raincoat and black leather gloves) bursts in and attacks her with a meat cleaver, stabbing her several times. Leaving her for dead, the killer then takes Helga's notes and begins to look through her papers while Helga tries crawling away.Down in the square below Helga's apartment, Marcus is talking with his constantly inebriated friend Carlo (Gabriele Lavia). Shorly after Carlo leaves, Marcus looks up and sees a bloody Helga crash through her apartment window. Marcus runs up to Helga's apartment, helps her dead body out of the broken window, and sees a person in a brown raincoat running away through the square. A little later, the police arrive and question Marcus about witnessing the killing. Marcus feels that something from the apartment is missing but cannot put his finger on what it is. Just then Gianna Brezzi (Daria Nicolodi) a fiesty photojournalist, enters the apartment, but is told to stay away by the lead detective. After his interogation, Marcus speaks with a drunk Carlo again in the square where he thinks he remembers a paint when initially entering Helga's apartment, but later was not able to locate it.At Helga's funeral, Gianna suggests that she and Marcus work together to find the killer on their own. Marcus sarcasticly thanks her for printing his name in the local newspaper and declaring him a witness which would make it easier for the killer to come after him. After discussing Helga's premonition with Giordani and Mario, and seeing Carlo to talk about the mysterious missing painting, Marcus goes to his aparment to compose some music. He soon hears the children's song, followed by the sounds of his door creaking open. As the phone rings, Marcus jumps up and pulls the door to his room shut, just when the unseen killer attacks. The killer leaves and whispers threats to him before leaving.The next day, Marcus goes to a record store and after going through albums of children's music, finds the song he heard. Mario tells him a folktake involving a haunted house in which a singing child is heard, followed by the shreiking of someone being murdered.In investigating the source of the music tune, the search leads Marcus to a novel which was written by a cerain Amanda Righetti (Giuliana Calandra), titled 'House of the Screaming Child' which describes a long-ago murder. In attempting to find Amanda Righetti to talk to her about her book, the unseen killer arrives at Righetti's villa first and murders her. The female author is stabbed in the spine, then dragged into a bathroom and drowned in a bath filled with scaldingly hot water. But Righetti manages to write a message on the wall of the steam-filled bathroom before expiring. Marcus finds the body, but aware that the police will think he did it, leaves the area without calling anyone.Marcus removes a photo of the supposed haunted house from the novel to help him in his search for the mysterious house. The photograph shows some exotic palm trees on the house grounds. Marcus tracks down the greenhouse owner who admits to selling a dozen or more Canary Island palms to that house, and procures the house's address from past records. Driving around, Marcus finally locates the house and learns from the caretaker who claims that no one have lived in the house before 1963 when the previous owner was killed. Marcus looks around and discovers a children's drawing on a wall long plastered over of a little boy holding a unknown bloody knife next to a murdered man.Meanwhile, Giordani investigates the Righetti murder scene after the police collect the body and leave, and on a hunch, turns on the hot water in the bathroom and sees part of the message left on the wall by murder victim. When Giordani returns to his office that night to investigate more, the unseen killer breaks in and kills him too - first by bashing his face against his desk, and then stabbing him through the neck.When Marcus learns of Giordani's murder, he makes plans to leave town but then discovers the clue that he overlooked in the photo of the deserted house: a window on one of the walls is missing. Marcus returns to the house after dark and after unsuccessfully trying to bash in the wall where the window was, which leads to him nearly falling off the scaffolding, he enters the house and using a pickaxe, bashes down an end-wall in a hallway and discovers the secret room with a rotting skeleton next to a Christmas tree. But the unseen killer arrives and knocks Marcus out. When he regains consciousness, he finds the house on fire, and Gianna by his side who arrived in the nick of time to pull him out of the house.Marcus and Gianna go to the villa caretaker's house to call the police and fire department when Marcus discovers that the caretaker's young daughter, Olga, had drew an identical drawing of the little boy with a bloody knife standing next to a Christmas tree with the murder victim. Olga tells them that she found the drawing and copied it from old file archives at her junior high school. Marcus and Gianna break into the Da Vinci Junior High School to search the archives for the drawing, when Gianna is stabbed by the killer and Marcus finds the painting, with the name on it which is Carlo, who appears before Marcus holding a gun and threatening to kill him for getting too close. Just then, the police led by the superintendent Calcabrini arrive and Carlo flees, but in a twist of fate, he gets sideswiped by a passing garbage truck which he gets hooked onto the fender and gets dragged down the street to his gruesome death.With the case apparently wrapped up with Carlo being the killer, Marcus drops off the severely wounded Gianna at the hospital, but in going back to the scene of the crime, tries to remember what he thought he saw. Carlo could not have murdered Helga Ulmann because he was with Marcus on the street when they saw the killer stabbing Ulmann. Marcus enters the murder victim's apartment and, after looking around, finally remembers what he saw in a mirror reflection that night: the face of the killer.The identity of the killer is finally revealed to be Carlo's insane mother Martha (Clara Calamai). Martha suddenly appears in the apartment and reveals everything to Marcus; when Carlo was still a child, he watched as his mother murdered his father when he tried to have her committed to a mental hospital. The young Carlo and mother then entombed the body in a room of their house.Wielding a meat cleaver, Martha chases Marcus around the complex and into the foyer with an elevator. Marcus gets hit in the shoulder by the cleaver, and, in the process, he kicks Martha toward the elevator shaft. Her excessively long necklace slips in through the crossed metal bars. She tries to pull herself away and, in doing so, the large pendant on the end of the necklace becomes lodged between two small metal bars. As Martha is desperately trying free her necklace, Marcus Daly realizes she is caught and presses the button to activate the lift. It travels downward and the necklace starts choking her tightly. Her hands are clad in black leather gloves, making her fingers much too thick to slip in-between her neck and the necklace to try and save herself before it's too late. The elevator provides so much force that the necklace ends up cutting through her neck, decapitating her... creating a huge 'deep red' bloodstain all over the marble floor."

Upon further investigation with binoculars, Roger and Frank conclude that they are watching an orgy. The revelry becomes violent, however, and the two men witness an occult ritual where a masked leader sacrifices a naked young woman by stabbing her through the heart. When Alice calls to Roger and Frank from the R.V., she unknowingly reveals them to the cultists, who chase after the men.After making their way back to the R.V., Roger and Frank tell their wives they witnessed a murder. As they attempt to drive away, the wheels become stuck in a river. Roger and Frank are able to push the R.V. free, but two men from the cult gain on them and smash the back window with logs as Roger fights them off.The next morning, the four vacationers stop at a police station in a small town and report their encounter to Sheriff Taylor (R.G. Armstrong), who insists that Roger and Frank return with him to the scene of the ritual. On the way, Taylor explains that drug-addicted hippies have destroyed the serenity of the area, and that he recently caught them skinning cats and smearing blood on their naked bodies, claiming to have seen the devil. When the police sweep the scene, they find evidence of a bonfire and bloodstains, but no discernible footprints. Although Frank discovers a sacrificed dog hanging on a tree, Taylor blames the incident on vagrants and suggests that the blood at the campsite belonged to the dog, not a young woman as Roger and Frank claim.Back in town, Kelly and Alice find a threatening note, written in English and Rune symbols, attached to the back window of the R.V. warning that any evil caused by the two couples will be returned nine fold.

To back up her cover story, Detective Bo Lockley (Michael Moriarty) has been given what should be an almost impossible assignment: without being told she is actually an undercover police officer, he is instructed to spend a few weeks trying to find Chicklet. Bo openly looking for and trying to find her will convince Stick that his girlfriend really is a runaway.Amazingly, Bo is actually an excellent detective and finds her in the sleazy underbelly of the city. Bo is then thanked by his supervisor, Richard 'Crunch' Blackstone (Yaphet Kotto) and told to go back to his previous assignment. Either infatuated with Chicklet or not able to just allow her to be abandoned by the system, he goes to Stick's loft to try and rescue her. In the process, Bo and Stick become engaged in a firefight, whereupon Stick is able to escape the apartment, and Bo ends up chasing Stick, running across town barefoot, carrying a handgun and dressed only in boxer shorts, into a department store, and are trapped in a Mexican standoff in one of the department store elevators.Eventually the police barricade the elevator, and Crunch grabs him when Bo and Stick leave through the elevator's emergency exit ceiling panel. Bo having been pulled to safety, the police then open fire on Stick, killing him.In the aftermath of the firefight and the subsequent killing of Stick, it is discovered that Officer Butler was killed in Stick's loft by Bo, and an investigation has to be made as to whether he was negligent. As a result of the investigation, it's determined that she was killed as a result of Bo trying to defend himself from Stick shooting at him, and thus the shooting was accidental. Bo, however, was so depressed by what he had done that he hung himself in his jail cell before he finds out that it was an accident.The movie is, in effect, a police report of an incident where a police officer was shot by another officer who later committed suicide in jail, and a suspected perpetrator being killed in a public place (the department store), being made to the Police Commissioner, which is where the title of the film came from."

Riffraff explains to Brad and Janet that they've arrived on a very special night as ""the master"" is having a party, where Brad and Janet meet the equally strainge house maid Magenta (Patricia Quinn), which leads into the infamous song ""The Time Warp"".The Criminologist comes on and explains the steps to the 'Time Warp' dance.Brad and Janet are ushered into a great hall with a throne and a jukebox at it's far end where conventionists of every size and description wearing tuxedos and party hats are dancing and singing the ('Time Warp'). During the song we are introduced to the gold-sequin-wearing, tap dancing Columbia (Little Nell). All of this is too much for Janet and Brad who try to sneak out carefully. Janet begs Brad to leave as the place is creepy, but Brad simply says that they should stay to watch more ""folk dancing."" Janet refuses as she's ""cold, wet and just plain scared!"", though Brad tries to reassure her.Janet turns around to leave and sees Dr. Frank N. Furter (Tim Curry) in full drag regalia, wrapped up in a black cloak. She screams and faints. Frank introduces himself though a song as a ('Sweet Transvestite') from Transsexual, Transylvania"". Brad asks him for help, explaining his plight, and Frank smirks and acknowledges that yeah, Brad needs help, and offers him a mechanic at first only to change his mind as ""Maybe the rain isn't REALLY to blame"" and instead decides to ""remove the cause but NOT the symptoms.""Frank then goes into an elevator and rises upstairs to the applause of the partying conventionists. Riffraff and Magenta strip Brad and Janet down to their underwear. Brad and Janet then are prodded into the elevator and taken upstairs to Frank's laboratory.Brad and Janet are led out into the center of an observing room where they are put on display by Dr. Frank N. Furter, now wearing a lab coat and long surgical gloves. The Transylvanian conventionists watch the events from an above balcony. Frank N. Furter then walks over to a box-like shape covered by a tarp and throws off the covering to reveal a tank. He shouts for Magenta and Riffraff to set the controls and start the machinery as the room darkens. Frank himself laughs maniacally as he turns knobs, dials, and wheels as fluids pour into the tank and a humanoid form appears slowly, skeleton first, much to Janet and Brad's terror.Carefully, Frank N. Furter leads out the humanoid figure wrapped entirely in bandages and cuts them away to reveal a full-grown man with blond hair, tanned skin, blue eyes and a muscular figure wearing only a skimpy golden bikini over his crotch. Riffraff spins some wheels he shouldn't have while cackling to himself, setting the blond man, known as Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood), loose. Frank chases Rocky through the lab crying his name as a bouncy song about the creation ('I Can Make You a Man'), Rocky feeling a sense of dread plays. Eventually Frank catches Rocky and scolds him for misbehaving, but says he forgives him as he's beautiful ('Sword of Damocles').Then, the deep freeze malfunctions and Columbia squeals, ""Eddie!"" A burly, heavyset biker named Eddie (Meatloaf) rides out on a motorcycle, dressed in black leather, singing about his former glory ('Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?/Hot Patootie') The conventionists eat it up, enjoying the show, but Frank becomes wrathful that Eddie stole his thunder and takes out a pickax, chasing Eddie into the deep freeze where he is hacked to bits. This puts everyone, even the giddy conventionists into a shocked and somber mood. Frank, tires to pick things up by talking about how beautiful Rocky is in a song ('I Can Make You a Man, reprise'), leading away his new creation to a ""bedchamber"" in a wedding-style procession.The Criminologist comes on again and mentions that Brad and Janet are in trouble now as they are being led away to separate rooms for the night.While separated, Frank N. Furter comes into Janet's bedroom, dressed as Brad, and seduces Janet. Then he goes into Brad's room, dressed as Janet and tries to seduce Brad. Brad puts up a little bit of a fight, but is talked into it. Afterwards, Janet feels frightened and used and goes to look for Brad. Meanwhile, Rocky escapes from the bedchamber and is running loose, chased by dogs through the rain outside the castle by the gleeful Riffraff. While wandering the castle lost and afraid, Janet encounters Rocky hiding in his tank at the lab. Seeing that he's injured, she tears her petticoat to bandage his wounds, pausing as she realizes she's aroused.The Criminologist comes on and mentions the complexity of human emotions and the dangers of lust. He fades away to Magenta and Columbia who are secretly watching Rocky and Janet in the tank via a monitor in their room.Janet tries to seduce Rocky, explaining that she used to be a virgin, but now she finds she really likes sex and wants it NOW ('Toucha Toucha Touch Me'). Rocky is more than happy to oblige. Meanwhile, Columbia and Magenta watch in secret from the closed circuited TV, laughing and playing with one another, making fun of the events unfolding before them.As the two women enjoy one another, Frank N. Furter beats up Riffraff for letting Rocky loose, while Brad watches with horror. An alarm goes off and Riffraff looks on another TV monitor and mentions that someone is outside by the main gate as they all look and see a middle aged man in a wheelchair buzzing the intercom at the front gate. Dr. Everett Scott (Jonathan Adams) has arrived at the castle. Brad recognizes his old teacher and is happy to see him, but Frank N. Furter is angry that the two know one another, recognizing Dr. Scott as a federal agent investigating UFOs, suspecting Brad and Janet are actually spies. Brad denies this, explaining that Dr. Scott is his science teacher from Denton High, but Frank doesn't believe him.Meanwhile, Dr. Scott enters the castle and finds himself alone in the 'zen room' filled with various smoldering insence. Frank N. Furter takes Brad to the lab where he turns on a powerful magnet to drag Dr Scott's wheelchair up to them... with Dr. Scott still inside it. The clunk of Dr. Scott's wheelchair arriving wakes the sleeping Janet and Rocky who sit up in shock. Everyone in the room is frightened, confused and hurt to see one another here. Magenta appears up and announces that dinner is ready. Attempting to handle things with grace, Dr. Frank N. Furter dismisses everyone for dinner, informing them that formal attire is optional as he stomps off enraged.Everyone meets in a grand dining room for a dinner of roasted beef and vegetables in honor of Rocky's Birthday. Frank demands that everyone sing Rocky ""Happy Birthday."" Dr. Scott reveals in a song ('Eddie's Teddy') that he's not here to investigate Frank and his household, but to look for his nephew, Eddie, who went missing with a cryptic cry for help in a letter being the last contact he had from him. Sure, Eddie was a no good kid, but he's still family. In response to this, the tablecloth is pulled off the table to reveal Eddie's hacked-up body in a glass case... and the fact that they were being served roast Eddie for dinner. Brad and Dr. Scott are paralyzed with terror, and Janet runs to Rocky's arms. Frank is outraged, slapping Janet. Janet runs away with Frank chasing after her, encouraging her through a song ('Once in a While') to stop sleeping with everyone else as she's now his.Janet, followed by Frank N. Furter, Rocky, Brad, and Dr. Scott end up in the lab again. Frank pulls a switch to ""glue"" everyone's feet to the floor but his. Everyone tells Frank he's a ""Hot dog."" In response, he simply flips a switch and turns them all to stone. Columbia comes in and tells Frank he's gone too far this time as now people are really hurt. Frank N Furter simply responds by turning Columbia to stone, too. He then tells Riffraff and Magenta to prepare for the floor show.The Criminologist comes on and hints that in this place where nothing's as it seems, the Floor Show is going to be something very shocking.The next scene we see the statue versions of everyone on stage, now all wearing fishnets, makeup, a thong and the same bustier. One by one they are unfrozen, and they each sing and dance a song ('Floor Show') about how they've changed since they came here. Rocky and Columbia sing about their past times ('Rose Tint My World'). Frank N. Furter, Brad and Janet sing their own version ('Fanfare/Don't Dream It'). Dr. Scott is accidentally unfrozen and realizes that this place is a trap and everyone should run while they still are sane enough to escape. Frank N. Furter comes out like a prized showgirl and sings a solo, starting an orgy in a swimming pool that is uncovered as he sings. After the orgy, Frank N. Furter sings a song praising his wild and untamed household ('Wild and Untamed Thing').This song, however is interrupted by Riffraff and Magenta, now wearing strange uniforms and armed with laser ray guns. Riffraff informs Frank that it's all over as his mission was a failure due to Frank becoming too extreme. He declares that Frank is now his and Magenta's prisoner as he has been made commander, and that they're going back to their home planet of Transylvania in the Galaxy of Transexual immediately. Frank is happy for this, singing about how long he's been wanting to go back to the homeland he was exiled from ('I'm Going Home'). Riffraff stops him again and explains that only he and Magenta are going home; Frank N. Furter is to be killed as Riffraff replies: ""say hello to oblivion"". Riffraff points a ray gun at Frank, but Columbia screams in an attempt to save Frank. Riffraff quickly turns around and kills her. Riffraff then kills Frank as he tries to run away. Rocky, seeing his creator fall, grabs Frank and climbs the set in the background of the stage, crying in rage and pain. It takes several shots from the ray gun, but Rocky is killed and falls into the pool where he and his creator float dead.Riffraff turns to Brad, Janet and Dr. Scott and tells them to leave now while they still can and they do so. Meanwhile, in a now empty house, Magenta and Riffraff celebrate going home as an incestuous relationship is implied. Brad and Janet, carrying Dr. Scott, escape just as the castle explodes and flies away under a rainbow and blue skies of dawn back to Riffraff and Magenta's home planet, leaving Dr. Scott, Janet, and Brad writing on the charred ground, still in drag from the floor show as it flies away into space. (In some versions the three of them sing one final song about loss of innocence called 'Superheros'.)The Criminologist comes back one last time with the somber, iconic lines describing the flying away of the house:""And crawling... on the planet's face... some insects... called the human race. Lost in time... and lost in space.... and meaning."""

tt0073705,"['Horror', 'SciFi']","At Starliner Towers, a modern high-rise apartment complex on Starliner Island located just outside Montreal, prospective tenants are welcomed by the smarmy manager Merrick. In one of the apartment, Dr. Emil Hobbes, attacks a young woman, named Annabelle, who wears a school uniform. He strangles Annabelle to death, slices open her stomach, and pours acid in before slitting his own throat.In another apartment, Nicholas Tudor, sits in front of a bathroom mirror, apparently suffering from stomach convulsions. Tudor goes to Annabelle's apartment, and recoils from the scene of carnage, but leaves without telling anyone about it.The two bodies are found by a resident doctor who calls the police. The resident doctor, Roger St. Luc, is quite calm about it as the paramedics carry the bodies away. St. Luc goes to the office of Hobbes medical partner, Rollo Linsky, who describes the project they were working on which Rollo explains it as: ""a parasite that can take over the function of a human organ"", and he also reveals Hobbes' penchant for pedophilia, telling St. Luc that he was once caught ""examining a young girl's breasts for cancer"" when the girl was 12 years old.Meanwhile, Nick Tudor's neglected and concerned wife, Janine, seeks advice from St. Luc about her husband's sickness and reluctance to see a doctor. At the same time, Tudor leaves work early and goes home to Starliner Towers after more convolutions. At his apartment, he vomits what appears to be feaces over the balcony, just as two old women pass below. It thumps onto one of the women's umbrella, startling them. They think a dead bird landed on them due to the blood-stained splat on the umbrella. The fecal parasite slithers away into the undergrowth.In the laundry room of the building, an old woman investigates a trail of brown slime leading from an open window to a washing machine. As she lifts the lid, the parasite hurtles out and clamps onto her cheek. She tries to pull it off but cannot.At Dr. St. Luc's office, an elderly man complains to the doctor about stomach lumps saying that he may have caught them as a sexually transmitted disease from ""the girl in 1511"" - Annabelle Brown.Meanwhile, a distressed Janine Tudor visits her friend Betts to confide in her about Nick's recent behavior. Betts tells Janine to give Nick some space while she clearly makes sly remarks to Janine about how she looks. When Janine returns to the apartment, Nick has passed out on the kitchen floor after throwing up blood.In a corridor, two children play door knocking pranks until a parasite appears in the mail box opener at one of the doors (the Tudor apartment) and the kids flee away in terror.Inside the Tudor apartment, Nick callously dismisses Janine's worry about his health. When he is alone, he lays on his bed and encourages his chest lumps to move, talking to them as if he is talking to a pet. Meanwhile, Betts runs a bath, listening to a radio announcement about the murder and suicide at Starliner Towers.In the building physician's office, Dr. St. Luc seems indifferent to the amorous advances from his nurse, Miss Forsythe. They are interrupted by the telephone. Linsky calls St. Luc from Hobbes office downtown where he found Hobbes notes, which far exceed their original project. According to Linsky reading one paper, Hobbes wrote: ""Man is an animal who thinks too much"", and had a vision about creating a parasite which was ""a combination of aphrodisiac and venereal disease that will hopefully turn the world into one mindless orgy"". He was also using Annabelle as a guinea pig for his experiment and that he infected with a parasite through sexual contact but when she got out of control he killed her since she could infect others with the parasites. St. Luc tells Linsky that apparently Annabelle was very sexually active and infected three or four men at Starliner Towers and explains about the few cases of stomach lumps already and mentions that Janine Tudor's husband may have been one of Annabelle's sexual partners. Linsky arranges to meet them later in Tudor's apartment to confirm and warns St. Luc about encountering anyone at the building complex behaving in a strange way.Meanwhile, Betts continues to relax while soaking in her bath, unaware of the parasite forcing its way up through the plughole and heading right for the nearest orifice. Betts screams and struggles as the bathwater turns red and thrashes in agony...At this point, the chaos really begins as it reaches inexorable ascendancy. Nurse Forsythe stabs a sex-crazed man who attacks her in her apartment. St. Luc arrives just as the infected man flees. He takes a sample of the infected man's blood for the lab to examine.At the same time, a parasite attacks an old French-speaking couple in the corridor before being impaled on the end of the old lady's walking frame. Soon, more assault by residents on others become more frequent. The old lady from the laundry room attacks a delivery man who shows up near her door. The infected delivery man then attacks a young woman and her little daughter in an elevator. Then the delivery man and infected woman and girl attack and infect the lobby security guard, and so on...Nick attempts to seduce Janine, but she resists when she feels the lumps moving in his stomach. At the same time, St. Luc finds the old French couple who tell him about their encounter with the parasite. While Nurse Forsythe keeps them company, the doctor the searches the basement dumpster where the old man claims to have threw the dead parasite, but gets ambushed by another infected man. Dr. St. Luc overpowers his assailant and unhesitatingly beats him to death.Afraid over what is happening to Nick, Janine is standing by her man as he sleeps... until a bloody parasite emerges from his mouth onto the pillow beside her. In a state of shock, she runs out of the apartment and into Betts... whom is also infected.Nurse Forsythe then leaves the elderly French couple and decides to try to leave from the building.St. Luc goes to Merrick's office and tells him to call the police. By now a zombie-like mob of people infected by the parasites is roaming all the corridors of Starliner Towers. The mob breaks into the old French couple's apartment and apparently infects them as well.In the basement garage, St. Luc finds Nurse Forsythe about to be raped by the infected security guard, and he shoots the man in the back, killing him with a gun that he takes from the guard. After attempting to escape from the car park, they are rammed by one of the 'crazies'. They try to get out on foot, but find the garage door closed and locked, and several 'crazies' approaching them. They are forced to flee back into the building. St. Luc and the injured Nurse Forsythe hide in the basement, waiting for the police to show up.In the lobby of the building, a young couple complains to Merrick (clearly infected at this point) about the disturbances. He ushers them into his office where the couple are immediately pounced on by a delirious group of orgyists and are infected as well.In Betts apartment, she comforts Janine, stroking her hair and leaning in close. She tells Janine that she always had a crush on her. As the two of them kiss, a parasite exchange takes place and Janine becomes infected.A little later, Linsky arrives at the Starliner Towers and hears distant noises, but nobody is around the lobby or anywhere else. He goes up to the Tudor apartment and finds the door wide open. Tudor is lying on the bed, his stomach seething with parasites. One of them lunges at Linsky who tries tearing them off with pliers. As Dr. Linsky stabbs the parasite with a kitchen knife, he is attacked and beaten to death by Tutor, who tears the parasite off the dead Linsky's face and crams it into his own mouth as an act of ownership.In the basement, Nurse Forsythe relates a dream she had about an old man saying: ""he tells me that even old flesh is erotic flesh, that disease is the love of two alien kinds of creatures for each other, that even dying is an act of eroticism"". A parasite appears crawling out of her mouth, and St. Luc knows right away that she is infected. He punchers her unconscious. As he carries her along a corridor containing storage lockers for the residents, the wooden wall panels burst apart and a sea of arms break through, reaching at them. St. Luc is forced to leave the infected Forsythe behind and runs to Tudor's apartment. He encounters Tudor in the kitchen kneeling over Linsky's bloody corpse. St. Luc shoots Nick Tudor dead. He then tries to escape from the building, but finds all the exits blocked. He encounters a gay couple trying to get at him, then an old man with a young girl in another apartment.St. Luc makes his way to the indoor swimming pool where he sees the infected Betts and Janine there fooling around. St. Luc finds an open patio door and walks out. Sensing that he is free, he runs away from the pool area and outdoor patio and up a grass river embankment only to be confronted by HUNDREDS of ""changed"" people slowly and silently advancing towards him. Forced to retreat back into the pool area, he is pushed into the pool where the infected Betts, Janine, and even Nurse Forsythe await. As the mob of 'crazies' jump in and attack him from all directions, St. Luc finally loses his struggle to remain 'human' and allows the mob to consume him.In the final scene, the time is 5:26 a.m. about an hour before dawn as a radio announcement describes a wave of unexplained sexual assaults across Montreal and the surrounding area which may have originated at Starliner Towers and that the authorities as well as the centers for disease control are currently investigating a possible epidemic of some kind. The final shots over the end credits show a long line of cars with infected people leaving Starliner Island and driving across the bridge leading to Montreal and the rest of the outside world...."
tt0073707,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Musical', 'Thriller', 'Western']","The Thakur recruits Veeru and JaiFormer police chief Thakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar) summons an old colleague and requests him to track down a pair of small-time thieves he once apprehended in the line of duty.
The two petty criminals, Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jai (Amitabh Bachchan), are close pals who work together and share everything. They had encountered the Thakur in the past (as seen in a flashback), when after being caught by him trying to rob a train, he let them free temporarily to help him fight off bandits. The three succeeded in doing so, but as the Thakur lay unconscious after sustaining a wound, Veeru and Jai disputed over leaving him for dead and escaping (Veeru) or letting him live but facing jail themselves (Jai). The call was decided over a coin toss, which Jai won.
Recollecting that experience, the Thakur explains that Veeru and Jai would be the ideal men to help him end the tyranny of Gabbar Singh(Amjad Khan) - an infamous dacoit (bandit) wanted by the authorities for a Rs 50,000 reward. But money is not what the Thakur is after.
Veeru and Jai are found and brought to Ramgarh. They are told by the Thakur that they are to bring Gabbar to him alive for Rs 20,000 plus the Rs 50,000 reward.
After some difficulty in trusting each other, the Thakur demands Veeru and Jai's word and eventually Jai promises that they will do the job and he and Veeru decide to stay in Ramgarh to repel attacks from Gabbar's large gang.The tyranny of GabbarThree of Gabbar's enforcers arrive in Ramgarh to collect supplies from the defenceless villagers. This time, however, they go back empty-handed, due to Veeru and Jai's intervention. The villagers show their gratitude by hailing their new heroes.
In Gabbar's camp, the tyrant interrogates the three men he sent to Ramgarh about why they were defeated by only two men. His psychotic nature is shown when he subjects his men to a twisted version of Russian Roulette where all three survive against the odds. This event amuses Gabbar who begins to laugh uncontrollably at the bizarre occurrence and the unlikelyhood of it happening. His cackles get louder and louder, as his henchmen join in. The three men who have survived this ordeal are bemused but then relieved and slowly begin to laugh as well. As the sounds of all of Gabbar's army laughing like fools reverberate around the rocky camp, Gabbar suddenly stops laughing and uses the three remaining bullets to shoot the three men dead.
Gabbar's plan to attack Ramgarh on Holi is put into action and in a much tougher battle this time, Veeru and Jai meet their match and are held at gunpoint. With his two recruits facing death, the Thakur has a chance to throw a gun to Veeru. But instead of helping, he simply stands stationary. With quick thinking, Veeru and Jai manage to save their lives but at the end state their intentions to walk away from Ramgarh, leaving the villagers to defend themselves, due to the Thakur's cowardice.
But before they can, the Thakur tells them the real reason of why he wants Gabbar and why he couldnt help them.
Some time ago, the Thakur had caught Gabbar and had him imprisoned only for the dacoit to escape and plot an evil revenge against him. Gabbar made his way to the Thakur's home and cold-bloodedly, killed his two sons, daughter, daughter-in-law and his only grandson. The only person in the family to survive this massacre was the Thakur's younger daughter-in-law, Radha(Jaya Bachchan).
The Thakur tracked down Gabbar but this time, the tyrant held the upper hand thanks to his gang and tortured him. Gabbar reminded the Thakur of his promise to come back and haunt him once he escaped and this was the day. Grabbing two swords, Gabbar maniacally approached the Thakur and ruthlessly amputated both his arms, although the Thakur survives it. The Thakur had shrouded this disability from Veeru and Jai, but now it was clear why he could not physically help them.Village lifeLiving in Ramgarh, the cynical young Jai and lively Veeru find themselves growing fond of the villagers, taking pity on their sufferings under dacoit tyranny. Some of the villagers evoke more than fondness. Veeru is attracted to Basanti(Hema Malini), a feisty, talkative young woman who makes her living driving a horse-cart. However, Basanti's aunt, who, thanks to Jai's meddling, is reluctant to let Veeru marry her niece and only after Veeru takes drastic measures does she finally agree.
Jai is drawn to Radha, the Thakur's reclusive widowed daughter-in-law, who very subtly returns his affections. The Thakur's servant, Ramlaal, tells of when Radha used to be full of life and colour until the day Gabbar killed her husband. After discussing it with Radha's father, the Thakur agrees that she can marry Jai.
The duo also befriend other villagers and instill a belief of freedom from Gabbar's villainous regime. Among these are the blind imam and his son, Ahmed, who has been offered a job in the city, but refuses to leave his father all alone. He is eventually talked into going and sets off on his horse. On the way, he has the bad luck of running into Gabbar's henchmen. Ahmed is killed and returned with a message for Ramgarh: Hand over Veeru and Jai or suffer the same fate as the dead boy.
As the villagers stand over Ahmed's body, they tell Veeru and Jai, that they can give away whatever wealth they have, but they cannot give away their children's lives. The Thakur, Veeru and Jai argue against ceding to Gabbar's threats, but only the imam, who has lost his son, convinces the villagers that they cannot simply give in to evil.The climaxVeeru and Jai fight back and send a message back to Gabbar: For every villager killed by Gabbar, Veeru and Jai will avenge them by killing four of his men in return. Gabbar, angered by this, swears death on Jai, Veeru, the Thakur, and all of Ramgarh.
The battle approaches its climax when Basanti and Veeru are captured and Jai follows. As Basanti is forced to dance by Gabbar to keep Veeru alive, Jai steadily gets through Gabbar's defences. Soon Jai is able to get into a position to shoot Gabbar and demands the release of his friends. Veeru and Basanti escape while Jai holds back the dacoits from a distance with a rifle. Once Veeru and Basanti are safe, Jai slowly draws back and heads for his friends, only to be wounded grievously by a bullet as he is running away.
Jai is reunited with Veeru and Basanti where they realise they are running out of ammunition. As Veeru is unaware of Jai's wound, Jai orders him to go back to the village where he can take Basanti and then return with ammo. Veeru does not want Jai to face the bandits alone, so he suggests that Jai should go. The two dispute once more and resort to what has been their only method of resolution over the years - the coin. As it was earlier in the film, Veeru loses the toss and goes back to the village.
Jai, slowly dying and with only a few bullets, manages to fend off advances by the bandits, who have hidden under a small bridge and have thrown a stick of dynamite that has failed to explode. Jai manages to get close enough to the dynamite and uses his last bullet to detonate it, taking out the bridge and most of Gabbar's men.
Veeru returns to find Jai dying and sadly talks with him before he dies in his arms. Some of the villagers rush to the scene, including Radha, who once again must endure the anguish of losing someone. As Veeru wipes a tear, he notices Jai's old coin in his hand and then it dawns on him that he had been tricked by Jai all along. The coin was double-headed and Jai had managed to manipulate every situation that they disagreed on to his favour. Angry at his friend for sacrificing his life to save him, Veeru becomes hell-bent on revenge and goes after Gabbar.
Veeru catches Gabbar and beats him up badly, about to finish him off. But before he can kill him, the Thakur appears and reminds him of the promise to bring Gabbar to him - alive. Veeru is ready to break his word to avenge Jai when he is told that it was Jai who made the promise.

Loneliness quickly sets in as Joanna, a mildly rebellious aspiring photographer, finds the women in town all look great and are obsessed with housework, but have few intellectual interests. The men all belong to the clubbish Stepford Men's Association, which Walter joins to Joanna's dismay. Neighbor Carol Van Sant's (Nanette Newman) sexually submissive behavior to her husband Ted, and her odd, repetitive behavior after a car accident also strike Joanna as unusual.Things start to look up when she makes friends with another newcomer to town, sloppy, irrepressible Bobbie Markowe (Paula Prentiss). Along with glossy trophy wife Charmaine Wimperis (Tina Louise), they organize a Women's Lib consciousness raising session, but the meeting is a failure when the other wives hijack the meeting with cleaning concerns. Joanna is also unimpressed by the boorish Men's Club members, including intimidating president Dale ""Dis"" Coba (Patrick O'Neal); stealthily, they collect information on Joanna including her picture, her voice, and other personal details. When Charmaine turns overnight from a languid, self-concerned tennis fan into an industrious, devoted wife, Joanna and Bobbie start investigating, with ever-increasing concern, the reason behind the submissive and bland behavior of the other wives, especially when they learn they were once quite supportive of liberal social policies.Spooked, Bobbie and Joanna start house hunting in other towns, and later, Joanna wins a prestigious contract with a photo gallery with some photographs of their respective children. When she excitedly tells Bobbie her good news, Joanna is shocked to find her freewheeling and liberal friend has abruptly changed into another clean, conservative housewife, with no intention of moving from town.Joanna panics and at the insistence of Walter, visits a psychiatrist where she voices her belief that all the men in the town are behind a conspiracy of somehow changing the women. The psychiatrist recommends she leave town until she feels safe, but when Joanna returns home, the children are missing. The marriage devolves into domestic violence when Joanna and Walter get in to a physical scuffle. In an attempt to find her children, she hypothesizes Bobbie may be caring for them. Joanna, still mystified by Bobbie's behavior, is desperate to prove her humanity but intuitively stabs Bobbie with a kitchen knife. But Bobbie doesn't bleed or suffer, instead going into a loop of odd mechanical behavior, thus revealing she is a robot.Despite feeling she may be the next victim, Joanna sneaks into the mansion which houses the Men's Association to find her children. There, she finds the mastermind of the whole operation, Dale ""Dis"" Coba, and eventually her own robot-duplicate. Joanna is shocked into paralysis when she witnesses its soulless, black, empty eyes. It is then suggested that the Joanna-duplicate strangles the real Joanna. In the final scene, the duplicate is seen placidly purchasing groceries at the local supermarket, along with the other ""wives"" all wearing similar long dresses, large hats and saying little more than hello to each other. The final shot focuses on Joanna's now-finished eyes."

When he finally arrives, Ben pleads with the ad agency director to see Willy; but the cantankerous old performer is so unfocused and disagreeable that he ruins any chance he might have had to land the job.Later, at Willy's apartment, Ben gets blamed for being unable to find work for his uncle. However, Ben tells Willy of an offer to do a spot on a upcoming TV special about the history of comedy. The network wants Willy to re-team with his former stage partner Al Lewis (George Burns) and perform their trademark ""Doctor Routine."" Willy refuses, claiming he feels betrayed by Lewis, who decided to retire. It is revealed here by Willy that he and Al were once a popular vaudeville comedy act known as ""Lewis and Clark"" and also called the Sunshine Boys. After 43 years together, they parted ways 11 years ago on unfriendly terms and have not spoken to each other since then. The break-up was due, in part, to Al's intent to retire and Willy's desire to continue performing.After delicate negotiations in which Ben visits Al in the New Jersey suburbs, where he now lives with his daughter's family, he persuades Willy to meet Al at his New York City apartment, discuss their differences, and rehearse the routine. After Ben leaves, Al enters and meets Willy for the first time in 11 years. The meeting is a disaster, and Al annoys Willy with his old habits. An attempt to rehearse the Doctor Sketch starts with the two grudgingly getting re-acquainted, but goes only as far as Al entering the doctor's (Willy's) office, before Willy decides to change the scripted long-established ""Come in"" to ""Enter!"" This results in a loud shouting argument and Al's stormy departure.Ben eventually negotiates a detente so the former partners will not have to speak with each other: simply show up for one technical rehearsal on the day of taping and then do the show. Ben tries to salvage the situation, despite the objections of Al's daughter to her father being bothered any more about the special and manages to get them in the studio. In the dressing room, Al and Willy do not speak to each other as persons, just like they did in the last year they did their sketches. There is unpleasantness when Willy carelessly dumps makeup jars on Al, followed by Willy's usual trouble with doors, in the dressing room.After Phyllis Diller finishes her scene and Steve Allen speaks his introduction, the Doctor Sketch starts. The technical rehearsal goes no better than the earlier confrontation in Willy's apartment. It flows smoothly until Willy starts shouting about Al's spitting on him and poking him in the chest. Despite Ben and the staff trying to restore order, Willy finally storms off the set, shouting accusations and abuse, and Al also leaves (finding it impossible to work with the man). In the stairwell, Willy's ongoing temper tantrum results in him being felled by a serious heart attack.Even though Willy is allowed no visitors, Al comes to the hospital to stand vigil. Later, Willy is discharged from the hospital and recovers at his apartment with the assistance of a private nurse that Ben hires. Willy constantly argues and verbally squabbles with the nurse.With the now-frail Willy no longer able to look after himself in his New York apartment, Ben and his wife visit the Actors Fund Home in New Jersey and arrange for Willy to move there. When Ben comes to tell Willy about the plan, Willy finally lets down his guard enough to express his fear that Ben will no longer make his regular Wednesday visits when he is all the way out in New Jersey. Ben assures his uncle that he will still come by, and that Willy will be surrounded by friends and be able to participate with his fellow show business retirees in putting on shows for the residents. As Ben leaves, Al shows up for a visit, and tells Willy that his daughter is going to be having another baby and the family will need the extra room where he has been living, so he has decided to move into the Actors Fund Home. In the final shot, as Al talks, Willy slumps in his bed with dread. Seemingly joined at the hip for eternity, the long-standing feud between Al and Willy will continue."

In the beginning, he is married to the hypersexual, demanding, and jealous SuperAngel (Shari Eubank), who constantly harasses him at work. She orders him home at once when she calls Clint and overhears a female customer, SuperLorna (Christy Hartburg), hits on him at work. Clint finds SuperAngel's constant accusations and arguing a turnoff and, back at home, they fight after he rejects her aggressive advances. A neighbor calls the police as Clint leaves for a local bar, where the bartender is the very scantily clad SuperHaji (Haji).Meanwhile, SuperAngel seduces Harry Sledge (Charles Napier), the cop who responded to the police call. He is impotent and unable to perform. She repeatedly taunts and insults him over this, which finally results in him killing her by stomping her brutally in a bathtub, then throwing a radio in the water which was plugged into the wall socket. Sledge burns down the house, then tries to pin the murder on Clint. Clint claims being in the pub all night, but SuperHaji has her revenge on him (from insulting her breast size earlier) by refusing to confirm his alibi. Clint is then forced to flee.In his rush to escape, Clint hitchhikes a ride from a man (John LaZar) and his girlfriend SuperCherry (Colleen Brennan). During the drive, SuperCherry comes on to him and puts his hand over her breast, but then pulls it back. She then tries to give him a handjob over his pants, but he continues to resist her advances. The driver takes offense to Clint rejecting his girlfriend, but she says he probably just wants a closer contact. She again attempts and fails to seduce him and he asks the driver to let him get out. The driver follows him out and beats and robs him. Clint is found by an old farmer who takes him to his farm to heal from his injuries and Clint agrees to work for the farmer for a week to repay him.The farmer has a younger Austrian mail-order bride, SuperSoul (Uschi Digard), who is hypersexual.

She immediately pushes him into his bed where she proceeds to mount and rape him, until he manages to overpower her. However, she does the same the following day and this time overpowering him after jumping him from behind in the barn.

tt0073800,"['Drama', 'History', 'Music', 'War']","Angelopoulos came to international attention with the release in 1975 of ""O Thiassos"" (""The Travelling Players""). The subject of this three-hour-and-forty minute historical epic is the adventures of a group of actors traveling across Greece from 1939 until 1952, performing ""Golfo,"" a traditional 19th Century Greek classic tale of unrequited love. In this way, the film covers the last days of the Metaxas dictatorship, the beginning of the World War II, the German occupation, the Liberation and the arrival of the English and the Americans, and the Civil War. Greece's political history and the actors' lives are being woven together along this journey.I have limited the synopsis to the film's timeline, with minimal commentary about some of the happenings. I hope this timeline will help clarify the contemporary Greek history for the reader, and therefore contribute to a better appreciation of the film.Following the credits, which appear on the background of a red theater curtain, hammering on the floor followed by three distinct thumps announces the beginning of the performance. An old accordion-playing man introduces the play (""Golfo, the Shepherdess,"" by Spyridon Peresiades). The film's main characters are based on Aeschylus' ""Oresteia trilogy"" (""Agamemnon,"" ""The Libation Bearers,"" and ""The Eumenides""), so we get a foreshadowing of their true natures: the father, Agamemnon (Stratos Pachis); the adulterous mother, Clytemnestra (Aliki Georgouli); the traitorous uncle, Aegisthus (Vangelis Kazan); the avenging daughter, Elektra (Eva Kotamanidou); the revolutionary son, Orestes (Petros Zarkadis); and the self-centered daughter, Chrysothemis (Maria Vasileiou). However, Orestes is the only character ever identified by name in the film. We can surmise who the other characters are by the vague mythical elements which surround them, and also by seeing the names listed in the film's credits.Winter, 1952. Cut to a gray winter morning. The nine travelling players are standing in front the Aegion train station, holding their suitcases. The players seem indistinguishable from one another. The troupe walks in the street, seeking a place to stay. Megaphones blare political slogans about Marshal Papagos, a candidate in the next presidential election. The group continues walking, but when they arrive at the town square, it is now fourteen years earlier, in 1939, and they are under the General Metaxas' pro-monarchy dictatorship. The group settles in a restaurant. Outside, Metaxas ""black shirts"" are parading and singing fascist songs. Aegisthus stands on a table and sings an old patriotic ballad, while his companions remain silent. The troupe stays at a nearby hotel for the night. Electra walks on the balcony, and happens by a room from which emanate lovemaking sounds. She peers through the window and sees her mother, Clytemnestra, in the arms of Aegisthus. A while later, a shocked and crying Electra sees her mother return to her own room.Clytemnestra and her husband are in bed, both asleep. Orestes enters the room and kisses his mother. A soldier, he has been called to the border. Although sleeping, Clytemnestra delivers a monologue that recalls an event that happened when Orestes was four years old. Orestes leaves the room and runs into his sister: they embrace and she cries. Later, Agamemnon, carrying his grandchild by Chrysothemis, speaks to Orestes in pessimistic terms about the future.The next scene shows Orestes, his friend -- as in the ancient myth -- Pylades (Kiriakos Katrivanos), and the Poet (Grigoris Evangelatos) walking along the railroad tracks. They speak of the threatening war. Arriving near a river bank, Pylades reads about the conditions for a true Marxist revolution. The three friends join in a chorus singing this Marxist speech, authored by Lenin.The actors are now in a ""kafeneon"" (a typical Greek bar), dressed up in traditional Greek mountain costumes for the performance of ""Golfo."" They stand before the window, advertising the upcoming performance with songs. They are lined up as the puppets in the traditional ""Karaghiozi""s Greek shadow-puppet theater. An accordion provides the accompaniment for the songs which always open such shadow plays. Eventually, the ""Golfo"" performance begins.Later that same night, Pylades is chased down the street by several of Metaxas' secret police. They catch him, and then beat him before pushing him into a car and taking him away. As the next scene opens on a lake at dawn, a boat carrying political prisoners approaches the dock. The police push Pylades and several new prisoners into the boat that will take them to some unknown place of exile. On the dock, Orestes, Electra, and the Poet are silent witnesses.October 28, 1940. The players are on a train. Agamemnon, facing the audience, makes the first of three monologues in the film. He recalls his arrival in 1922 from Ionia, Asia Minor, to Greece, as a refugee. This is quite different from Agamemnon, the King, who returned triumphant from Troy to Argos. The players end up in a small town, where they will be playing ""Golfo"" in a small theater. The play is interrupted by the announcement that at 5:30 in the morning, WWII commenced with the invasion of Greece by Italy. Early the next morning, Agamemnon, wearing a soldier uniform, is seen saying goodbye to Electra and Chrysothemis: the war is breaking up the group.Early 1941. On a gloomy, rainy day, Electra walks down a street. She is being followed by a young fascist Italian soldier. They enter a hotel and go to a room. Electra tells the soldier to strip. Excited, he complies, but when he is finally naked, he gradually becomes uncomfortable and embarrassed by Electra's stillness. Electra, fully clothed, rises and leaves the room. Quite a role reversal!April 27th, 1942. The German army has just entered Athens. The Third Reich flag is raised. The German occupation of Greece has begun.Autumn, 1952. Pylades comes to Elektra's bedroom and says, ""Let's go."" The players walk by the sea. In the background, we hear announcements of the upcoming election over megaphones. Going back to the same location, ten years before, there is a performance of ""Golfo"" being again interrupted, this time with the Germans' arrest of Agamemnon. Aegisthus has betrayed him. In the next scene, Agamemnon is waiting to be executed by a firing squad. He stands before a wall upon which one can read several inscriptions bearing the letters EAM. EAM (""Ethniko Apeleftherotiko Metopo""), the largest of the resistance movements, began operations within months of the German occupation, and was established by the Greek Communist Party, KKE (""Kommunistiko Komma Elladas""). As Agamemnon faces the audience, he identifies himself, ""I come from beyond the sea, from Ionia. And you?"" This is the traditional form for greeting strangers, going back to antiquity. Of course, the greeting is lost on the German soldiers. The soldiers fire and Agamemnon falls to the ground.1943. A line of people waits for some kind of food distribution. Chrysothemis walks to a house, carrying an empty bottle. She knocks at the door. A fat man opens the door and leads her down to the cellar. He taps one of his oil kegs, and waits for payment. Without a word or hesitation, Chrysothemis strips singing ""In your eyes there is a calm sea"" as the merchant sits in his chair, watching her. This scene directly parallels the earlier one between Electra and the fascist Italian soldier. As Chrysothemis leaves the merchant's house, she crosses paths with two men. Shots are heard, and we see the merchant who had come out to lock his door after Chrysothemis' departure slumping to the ground. We speculate that maybe these two men, obviously EAM members, were tipped off by Chrysothemis about this profiteer. Chrysothemis enters the hotel where the players are staying and puts the bottle of oil on the table around which the group is sitting. They all look at it, fascinated.1944. The travelling players walk down a snowy mountain road, singing cheerfully. Their happy song stops at a turn of the road, when they arrive at a large tree from whose branches hang two men. There is no explanation as to their identities. Perhaps they are partisans, hung by the Germans: we are just being confronted with Death. Later, in a rather comical, silent scene, the group surrounds a lone wandering chicken, which ends up in the cooking pot. Here, we are confronted with Hunger.The group is traveling in a bus which is stopped by German soldiers. They are forced out of the bus and are marched to an old castle that serves as a prison camp. Later, they are lined up against a wall to be executed. Aegisthus steps forward and pitifully tries to negotiate, but he collapses, and is carried back to the wall. We hear shots, and the prisoners fall to the ground. However, they are not shot: the prison camp is under attack by the partisans.It is dawn. A large group of people rushes into the prison camp waving a German flag. They climb the embankment and hurl the flag into the sea. Bells ring and everybody is joyous. Partisans on horseback arrive in the camp crying, ""Freedom to the people!"" The war is ended.In a town square, a large crowd is waving Greek, American, and Russian flags. Some shots ring and the crowd runs, leaving behind several dead. That same night, the traveling players try to leave town. They are in the middle of a fire fight between the government soldiers and the EAM partisans. Eventually, the group manages to escape.The group walks along the beach. They are stopped and searched by British soldiers. When the soldiers find that they have encountered a troupe of actors, they request a free performance. The players are only too happy to oblige, and eventually everybody ends up dancing with everybody else, to the music of the eternal accordion. However, the merrymaking is stopped by a single shot that kills one of the soldiers.1945.	Electra walks down the nighttime street. There is a variety of music in the air. She meets Orestes, Pylades, and the Poet, who all wear EAM uniforms. Inside a large building, a performance of ""Golfo"" is under way. Orestes goes onstage, where he shoots his Clytemnestra and Aegisthus to avenge his father's death. The audience stands up and applauds.Moments later, Electra is in her mother's room. She sits on the bed, wearing her mother's coat, when men burst into the room and take her away. They take her to a dark, empty tavern, and wearing clown masks, four of them hold her down while a fifth one rapes her, striking her from time to time. He interrogates her as to the whereabouts of Orestes. Electra reveals nothing. She wakes up by the bank of a river where the rapists have dumped her. She stands, brushes the dirt from her coat, and facing the audience, begins the second monologue of the film. She describes how, following the departure of the Germans, the civil war began. She recounts the battle in Athens between the government troops and the communist Partisans.In a town square are assembled British, American, and French soldiers. They are supervising the agreement which will end the Allied occupation. One by one, on horseback, the communist Partisans come and surrender their weapons.Electra is in her room. We hear Chysothemis' young son reading a war story. Chrysothemis is packing to leave the group, and her son. The sisters meet silently in the hallway. Three men enter Electra's room and ransack it. They leave three pictures of Orestes in his ""andartis"" (communist partisan) uniform on the table. Electra goes out in the night. Right-wing slogans are being broadcast from a PA system. As she passes a ""kafeneon,"" she sees several people being dragged out by right-wing thugs.1946. Electra walks into a nightclub: a sign advertises a special dance for January 1, 1946. She walks across the room and stands by the orchestra. An all-male group of right-wing government supporters is seated at a table. They are drably dressed in cheap suits and hats. Another group consisting of couples, dressed in a more eclectic and colorful fashion, is seated near the orchestra. They represent the Left. These two groups start a musical duel, each singing songs pertinent to its ideology. Finally, a right-wing man pulls out a hand gun and shoots into the air. The music stops. The left-wing couples indicate they are not armed and walk out of the establishment. The fascists stand up, and pairing off, dance. Electra leaves the hall.The group of right-wing men is walking through the empty street at dawn. When they reach the square, it is now 1952, and a royalist government rally is taking place. Electra and the travelling players are making their way through the crowd.1949.	In a street, a small band leads a jeep carrying soldiers. As the group nears, we see a soldier standing up, holding in each hand the decapitated head of a communist -- a common fate for communists captured during the civil war. Following the jeep is a group of communist prisoners. Among them is Orestes.1950. In the harbor, a boat seen earlier taking prisoners away to exile brings back some prisoners to be released. Pylades is one of them. He meets Electra and they walk together to a ""kafeneon."" There, Pylades delivers the third monologue of the film. He explains how he was captured in 1947 and sent to detention. Like so many, he was tortured so he would sign a confession, but he never did.Chrysothemis and an American soldier are getting married. The wedding is taking place on the beach. Chrysothemis introduces her husband to Electra and her now teenage son, but both remain silent. The wedding feast continues with American and Greek songs, and someone calls for a toast. At this, Chrysothemis' son rises and walks off, in obvious protest, dragging the tablecloth with him. Everything on the table crashes to the ground.1951. Electra travels to a prison by the sea. She is taken to the morgue, where Orestes' body is laid on a table. She stares at the body from the doorway for a while. She then approaches her brother's corpse and murmurs a line from ""Golfo,"" ""Good morning, Tasso,"" in remembrance of Orestes' role in the play. In the next scene, the players follow the Orestes' hearse to the burial ground. The group stands by the grave, and as two men shovel dirt onto the coffin, Electra suddenly applauds, and the whole group follows, as a salute to Orestes' brave life.1952. People enter an old theater, where the players are to present yet another show of ""Golfo."" Electra helps Chrysothemis' son, who is now dressed up as a Greek shepherd, assuming Orestes' former role of Tasso. It is now Pylades, banging the hammer against the floor, who announces the performance. The accordion plays. The show must go on.Autumn, 1939. In the town of Aegion, the traveling players have arrived, carrying their suitcases, as we saw them at the beginning of the film. The cycle is complete."
tt0073802,"['Mystery', 'Thriller']","Joe Turner (Robert Redford) is an employee of the CIA. He's not a secret agent, his job is to read, and he and his co-workers at the American Literary Historical Society read everything; books, comics, magazines, and they scan everything into a database to be cross-checked against real CIA operations. On a rainy December morning it's business as usual, so no one notices the non-descript man sitting in plain sedan across the street from Joe's building, checking off names of every employee as they enter.Inside, Joe looks for an answer to a letter he'd sent to the main CIA office at Langley. He has a theory about connections he's noticed between operations in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and other locations around the world, but so far there's no response. Noon approaches, and it's his turn to go out for lunch. Since it's still raining, he ducks out the basement door (which is against regulations) and cuts through several back alleys to the deli. Meanwhile, the sedan out front quietly pulls away after signaling to 3 men (one is a mailman) waiting in the street. They move in with quiet determination and knock on the front door. The mailman stands in view of the camera while the other two wait behind him.At the deli around the block, Joe picks up lunch for the others and then runs back. Since the rain has stopped, he goes to the front door, and buzzes the security intercom to be let in, but gets no answer. Pushing on the door, he finds it is unlocked, which it never is. Inside he finds a scene of carnage. Everyone has been murdered, shot to death in the few minutes he has been gone. Fighting down his shock and horror, he grabs a pistol from the receptionist's desk and flees.Suddenly, everyone on the street looks suspicious, and Joe realizes that whoever killed his coworkers is probably still looking for him. He finds a payphone and calls an emergency contact number at the CIA. ""This is...uh...'Condor'"" Joe says, fighting through the shock to remember his code name. ""The section's been hit. Everyone's dead."" Told not to panic, and to call back in two hours, a CIA response team quickly arrives and verifies Joe's story. Higgens (Cliff Robertson), the section chief in New York, wonders why in the world someone would take out a research office like this, and calls his supervisor at CIA headquarters.Joe calls back and is told to stay alive 1 more hour. One of the other workers had called in sick, so Joe goes to his apartment. He finds the co-worker in bed, shot to death, just before two men show up. Joe returns to his apartment building and is about to go in when a neighbor, sweeping the sidewalk, tells him that him that the two friends that he was expecting are waiting for him upstairs. Joe takes off without a word.When Joe calls the CIA back, he's to meet his dept. head in a specified back alley off 72nd street where he'll be picked up and brought in safely. Very skittish over the murder and close calls, Joe hesitates because he's never met his section chief (Wicks) or Director Higgins. They see in Joe's file that a college friend, Sam Barber, is a CIA accountant. Joe agrees to the meet if Sam is there. When Joe enters the alley, only Sam is visible. Suddenly, Wicks darts into view and shots ring out. His own department head is trying to kill him. Joe fires back and wounds Wicks and then runs away in a panic. Wicks is seriously injured, but steadies himself long enough to shoot Sam in the throat. Convinced he can trust no one, in desperation he kidnaps a woman on the street as she gets into her truck. Kathy (Faye Dunaway) is terrified, but drives Turner to her apartment. Terrified himself, he holds the gun on her as he tries to figure out what to do next.Gradually, Kathy begins to realize that Turner is in real trouble and doesn't want to hurt her, but she still doesn't believe his story. When 6pm rolls around, he turns on the evening news only to find that they are calling the incident in the alley an attempted robbery in which only Wicks was shot. There is no mention of Sam. Still unsure of Kathy's loyalty, he ties her up and sneaks over to Sam's apartment in her car. Sam's wife Mae (a former lover from college) has prepared dinner and drinks as if she and Sam were expecting him. When pressed, she reveals that the office (CIA) had called AFTER Sam met Joe in the alley to say he would be running late. Joe realizes that this is a trap and hustles Mae upstairs to the neighbors.Realizing the assassin is hard on his tail, he tries to get out of the building alive, and when he gets on the elevator, Joe finds himself next to a quiet man in a trenchcoat. This is Joubert (Max Von Sydow), a freelance assassin from Europe. (As we will learn, his hobbies include fine wine, classical music, and painting military miniatures from perhaps the Napoleonic Era.) Some inner sense tells Joe that this fellow is part of the problem, and Joe lags behind as Joubert walks out through the lobby. Convincing a group of loitering youth to walk out with him and screen him, he makes it back to Kathy's Bronco as the trenchcoated man waits nearby, holding a sniper rifle, seeking Joe in the crowd. Unable to get a clear shot, Joubert runs after the truck and uses his scope to get the vehicle's license plate number.Joe returns to Kathy's apartment just as her boyfriend is calling. Joe lets Kathy talk to the boyfriend, who is angry, at first, that she's not on her way their rendezvous. Kathy is on-the-edge but manages to hold up her end of the conversation. They hang up. Joe begins to feel guilty and tells her that he'll leave in the morning. They discuss her work (photography) and Joe pieces her life from his observations. Joe says he just wants to ""make it all stop"" for a few hours - the horror. They connect. They spent the night together.The next morning, Kathy is in the shower when THE Mailman (the guy who rang the bell at the building the day before) knocks at the door. Joe has been traced here via Joubert's writing down of the license plate the night before. The Mailman/hitman has a package for Kathy that must be signed for. Joe doesn't want to open the door but the Mailman has a well-rehearsed reply for every one of Joe's objections. (Joe yells through the window, ""She's not home!"" Mailman: ""That's OK, YOU can sign for it."" etc.) Joe opens the door but the Mailman's pen doesn't work (again, a rehearsed device to enable the Mailman to get inside and shut the door). As Joe goes looking for a pen he glances back at the Mailman's shoes. Suddenly, a stunned Joe realizes the Mailman is a hitman. He knows this because of the distinctive style of shoes he wears - one more thing Joe picked up in his voluminous reading. Thinking fast, he hurls hot coffee at the Mailman just as the nasty guy begins firing with a suppressor-equipped machine gun. The machine gun ends up on the floor. Joe's .45 is out of reach. A fight ensues - the Mailman is a martial arts expert with a nasty kick; Joe wields a fireplace poker and knows this man is a trained killer. Kathy emerges from her shower to find them fighting, provides a crucial bit of help to Joe, and retreats. The fight continues. Kathy's photo equipment plays a pivotal role. The fight concludes with Joe retrieving the .45 in the nick of time, firing two shots, and killing the Mailman/hitman. Kathy emerges to find her living room messed up and Joe sitting next to the dead mailman. She, needless to say, is terribly upset. Joe tries to console her. Joe searches the hit man and finds a couple of vital pieces of information including a hotel key (mentioned below). Joe and Kathy must now flee because the bad guys know where he is.Despite his fear, Joe has the beginnings of a plan, and Kathy agrees to help. They visit the NYC office of the CIA and Kathy pretends to apply for a job, then gets ""lost"" while she looks for Joe's section chief, Higgins. Once spotted, she helps Joe kidnap him while he eats lunch, and Higgins is hustled into the back of Kathy's Bronco. Interrogated by Turner, he confesses that he doesn't know what's going on any more that they do. ""This is obviously an inside operation"", he says, and it doesn't help that Wicks died, mysteriously, in the hospital. Joe confronts Higgins with the Mailman's ID and that he had a phone number that rang an office in CIA-Langley. Higgins begins to suspect that the lead assassin is Joubert, a former CIA assassin that now does contract work. Back at the office, Higgins does a search and finds information linking Joubert and the Mailman as partners in past CIA hits.Joe manages to put the pieces together by tracking down Joubert, the quiet man in the trenchcoat. Joe found a hotel key on the Mailman and finds Joubert in the same hotel. Tapping into the phone exchange in Joubert's hotel, he monitors the calls, and places an anonymous one himself to Joubert. ""Do you believe the Condor is an endangered species?"" he asks, and hangs up. Joubert quickly calls his controller, and Joe is able to track the call to a man named Atwood, a high-level supervisor in the CIA. From a telco trunk, he crosswires 50 phones to block a trace and calls to tell Higgins that he's found Joubert and asks who Atwood is. Higgins doesn't answer and Joe hangs up. One of Higgins supervisors is listening close by and tells him ""this"" needs to be ended, NOW. As he prepares to confront Atwood, Joe thanks Kathy for all her help, and they reluctantly part company.At Atwood's country home, the stereo suddenly comes on in the middle of the night, and when he investigates the noise in his study, Atwood finds Turner sitting quietly in a chair, holding a gun. Forced to confess, Atwood tells Joe that the hit on the section was due to that paper he'd sent to CIA headquarters. Joe demands to know why so many people had to die over some nothing book that suddenly became popular in the Middle East, Netherlands (Dutch), Mexico, Venezu......ohhhhh....OIL! Atwood is involved in a scheme to manipulate the world's oil markets and Turner's paper had hit too close to the truth. He and anyone else who might know about it had to be eliminated. Furious, Joe points the gun at Atwood.""Drop the gun,"" says a quiet voice; It's Joubert, standing quietly behind him. Realizing his defeat, Joe drops the pistol on the floor and waits for the inevitable, thinking that at least now he knows why all this has happened. Joubert, still holding his gun on Joe, takes a position next to Atwood, and like a cobra strike, turns and shoots Atwood in the right temple! As Joe stutters, Joubert places his gun in Atwood's hand and calmly begins to wipe down the room, asking what he had touched. Joe realizes that Joubert had a new contract to take out Atwood. Joubert confirms, ""Atwood had become an embarrassment,"" and that the contract that Atwood put on Condor has died with him.After leading him outside the house and handing back his pistol. ""Can I drop you somewhere?"", he asks in a friendly tone. Joe agrees to be taken back to New York. As they leave, Joubert advises that his life will never be the same again and there is no guarantee that ""someone"" won't decide that he's a liability in the future. He even describes how IT might happen, and offers that Europe is not a bad place to live. Impressed by how he handled the situation, Joubert suggests that he strongly consider a future as an assassin.With a new lease on life, Joe still has a few loose ends to tie up. Returning to New York, Joe waits for Higgins to walk past on the street, and they have a tense final confrontation. Higgins explains that the CIA does business this way because they need to. There is no other way. Turner disagrees, and as they stop in front of a distribution center of the New York Times, Turner tells Higgins that they've become too used to killing people as part of their job. He's told a reporter everything.""Ah, you fool,"" sighs Higgins. ""You've done more harm than you know."" As Turner walks away, Higgins calls after him. ""It didn't have to end this way Condor. You're about to become a very lonely man."" Joe seems not to care. He believes he's had his revenge on the CIA, and he fades away into the crowd as a Salvation Army Band plays Christmas music. But the haunting last words of Higgins linger in the air: ""How do you know they'll publish? How do you know???"""

Obra and Grady both state that there is no way Buford resigns until he either convicts or kills everyone who was involved in the ambush that led to his wife Pauline's death (in the previous movie).Buford's mother (Lurene Tuttle) and his children visit Buford who is still in the hospital recovering from plastic surgery that was needed to restore his face. Buford's mother asks him about re-election and confesses that she wishes he would retire. ""There ain't no shame in quitting, Buford,"" she tells him. To which he replies, ""I know , Mama.""Buford (now played by Bo Svenson) is re-elected and his first order of business is to bust up a still operating on the banks of the river. Buford and his deputies surprise the moonshiners and round them all up, except for Pinky Dobson (Luke Askew) who gets away in a boat.Dobson then goes to the mansion of local mob boss John Witter (Logan Ramsey). Witter is angry when Dobson brings Boston-based hit-man Ray Henry (John Davis Chandler) to the meeting. Witter makes Ray Henry wait in another room while he and Dobson privately talk about what to do about Buford. Witter grumbles about how Buford has cost him a lot of money by shutting down his prostitution and gambling operations. He puts pressure on Dobson to take Buford out. Dobson promises he will.Dobson goes to a car racetrack to talk to a driver named Stud Pardee (Richard Jaeckel) about helping him to get rid of Buford. Pardee strips two of Buford's lug bolts on his Impala and then entices Buford into a high-speed car chase. Buford's wheel does come off during the chase but he survives unhurt. Meanwhile, the only participant in the ambush that Buford recognized from police photos turns up with a bullet in his head. Witter brings in a beautiful woman named Marganne Stilson (Angel Tompkins) to win Buford's confidence and eventually kill him. ""Take a week,"" he tells Stilson. ""Take two weeks. Just don't press to hard or he'll be on to you. This man is no dummy.""An investigation reveals that the only blue and white Camaro in the county is owned by Stud Pardee. Buford gets a warrant, tracks down Pardee and proceeds to destroy his prized car while looking for contraband. After tearing apart the door panels, having Obra cut open his tires which costs $300 a piece and knocking out all the windows, Buford finds a pint of whiskey under Pardee's seat. Buford offers Pardee a drink. Pardees declines. Buford tells him, ""You look like you could use a drink."" Pardee takes the bottle and tries to drink it all down. Buford stops him, telling him, ""I need the rest of this for evidence."" Pardee tells Buford, ""You know you have a hell of a lot of enemies around here.""

The man asks Buford why he is has time to bother ""us poor blacks"" Buford tells him, ""Same as everyone else."" To which the man replies, ""Same as that big horse ranch on the hill?"" He says Buford looks the other way because A.C. Hand (Archie Grinalds) is a friend of his father's. Buford tells Obra to swear out a warrant for A. C. Hand because ""I don't want there to be any misunderstanding from anyone."" Buford raids Hand's place and tells him he's going to be facing time in the penitentiary.

Since it's his day off, Obra explained, it wouldn't cost the county anything. Buford is hesitant at first, but Obra finally convinces him. Obra is driving 100 mph in Buford's car when he discovers the brakes are out, and the steering has been tampered with. Obra dies in a head-on collision.

Buford says no problem and offers to take her there. Two snipers are waiting for him in a boat. Stilson suggests a picnic. Buford says it may be a little chilly for a picnic.

tt0073918,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","Harry Kilmer (along with friend George Tanner) were in Japan after the war in the Pacific ended. During this time Kilmer met and fell in love with a beautiful Japanese woman named Eiko Tanaka. But for some reason Kilmer cannot fathom and which Eiko will not tell him, she will not marry him. Finally he leaves Japan and returns home to the USA where he does some police and detective work to earn a living.Tanner continues a business relationship with some very shady underworld figures in Japan (the Yakuza) and in particular with the local boss Tono. In fact he is selling guns to this mafia like organization, but on one transaction he fails to deliver. As a consequence the Yakuza kidnap Tanner's daughter and Tanner turns to Kilmer to help him try to recover his daughter safely.So Kilmer returns to Japan to do what he can for his then friend. He visits Eiko of which their mutual love is quite apparent but who will still not marry him. We also meet her brother, Ken Tanaka who once was a Yakuza himself but resigned and became a respectable swordsman instructor in the ancient tradition of Japanese warfare by the sword. Ken is a master swordsman.Ken is a strange man (""he who never smiles""), and only reluctantly helps Kilmer to rescue Tanner's daughter. He does so because of the totally Japanese concept of obligation or rather burden called ""giri"", a social tradition of the old world of Japan.It is by this tradition, in fact, that Ken is bound to assist Kilmer since Kilmer did in fact, save Eikos life during those terrible days after the war. It is then that Ken takes up the sword once again to actually fight (rather than teach), and joins Kilmer in the rescue.The result is a bloody battle to (successfully) rescue Tanners daughter. Unfortunately two of the Yakuza men guarding the captive are killed in the fight, so now the Yakuza, and in particular the boss Tono put a price on heads of both Kilmer and Ken. And while Kilmer can just get on a plane and fly home where the Yakuza will not bother him, Ken is a different story and will definitely die at Tonos bidding.Kilmer decides he cannot do this after what Ken has done for him. He seems to feel the ""giri"" himself and, in fact, feels he is obligated to Ken. They talk it over and decide there is no choice but to try to kill Tono. It is either Ken or Tono, they figure.Kilmer and Ken then undertake the most dangerous venture, to break into and attack the secure Yakuza compound where Tono hangs out along his henchmen. This could be a form of suicide especially since Japanese (and Yakuza) tradition require that Tono die by the sword and not by a gunshot (Kilmer has two or three guns but Ken only his sword). As a Yakuza Ken can only use a sword.They break in and hold the mob at bay briefly. Ken says I come (only) for Tono, but this makes little difference to the mob and a battle ensues where between Ken's master swordsmanship and Kilmer's threatening (and sometimes deadly) gunfire they succeed in wiping out this mob. (Note that the Yakuza gangsters have only swords, no guns.)At some point earlier in the movie we learn of another strange Yakuza custom concerning the custom of ""giri"". If the person who is obligated cannot repay his burden he may make a symbolic offering by severing the one of his small fingers (his pinkie) at the joint and giving it to the person to whom he is indebted. If the person accepts the token of forgiveness of burden then the matter is resolved. We see this ritual twice as Ken offers this ""giri"" to his older brother (who is actually only a brother in the Yakuza sense), but who is socially a prominent businessman and one of enough influence to have covered up the massacres.(NOTE: The following is a serious spoiler-do not read it if you plan to see the movie): Ken (much against) his Yakuza brothers will, performs this ritual and is unhappily forgiven his burden by this brother. Kilmer on the other hand learns something from the brother he could never have imagined. It turns out that the reason Eiko could never marry Kilmer is that she is married to Ken. Ken is actually her husband, not her brother. He had hid in a cave after the war and only several years later found his wife, now comfortably set up with a small tea house business bought for her by Kilmer. Thus when Ken returns this totally torn man must honor Kilmer for saving and then helping his wife because of his ""giri"" and so tells Kilmer that he is her brother.In the end Kilmer takes a taxi to the airport but is himself torn by his ""giri"" to Ken. He tells the cab driver to turn around and goes back to see Ken. Kilmer tells him he came back because there is something important he must talk to him about. This is true, but while Ken goes for tea Kilmer himself performs the ritual of severing his pinky and in the tradition, putting it in a handkerchief, offers it to a shocked, but an emotionless Ken when he returns. Kilmer asks Ken to accept his token of apology for what HE HAS DONE (to Kens life however unwittingly), and asks him to please forgive Eiko as well. Ken, of course accepts, and says the words which seem to be the traditional response ""no man has a greater friend.""Finally the two men with bandaged pinkies go to the airport for a final goodbye and Kilmer leaves, very emotionally, for home."
tt0074084,"['Drama', 'History']","Born on the day of the death of renowned composer Giuseppe Verdi (January 27, 1901) two best friends, Alfredo Berlinghieri (Robert De Niro as an adult) and Olmo Dalcò (Gérard Depardieu as an adult) come from opposite ends of the social spectrum. Alfredo is from a family of wealthy landowners led by his abusive but populist grandfather Alfredo the Elder (Burt Lancaster), while Olmo is an illegitimate peasant son of an unmarried teenage peasant girl living off the estate whose grandfather Leo Dalcò (Sterling Hayden) is the foreman and peasant strong man who verbally and spiritually carries a duel of wits with both the peasants as well as his employer, but without ever reaching violence with Elder Alfredo's bidding. While growing up, the young Alfredo is somewhat rebellious and despises the falseness of his family, in particular his weak but cynical father Ottavio (Werner Bruhns), he befriends Olmo, who was raised as a socialist.The two become friends throughout their childhood, despite the social differences of their families. When Alfredo is around age 10, his grandfather, suffering from gout, dementia, and other ailments, commits suicide by hanging himself in the dairy barn. As a result, Alfredo the Younger's father, Ottavio, inherits the plantation.In 1917, the teenage Olmo enlists with the Italian army during World War I and goes off to fight on the front lines in northern Italy while Alfredo stays behind to learn how to run his family's large plantation. Olmo returns from the war over a year later and his friendship with Alfredo continues. However during Olmo's time away, Alfredo's father has hired Attila Mellanchini (Donald Sutherland) as his new foreman following the death of Olmo's own grandfather, Leo. Attila is sadistic man who becomes taken with fascism, especially after the fascists come to power in the early 1920s, Italy.Attila eventually incorporates his new belief system in his dealings with the Berlinghieri workers; he treats them cruelly and later cages them in the Berlinghieri compound and accuses them of treason against Fascist Italy. Several are killed by Attila himself. Alfredo's father, Ottavio, eventually dies from an illness and Alfredo inherits the vast estate as its sole heir. As the new padrone (master) of the plantation, Alfredo does little to challenge or halt Attila's evil actions.During the late 1920s and early 1930s, the intimacy and lack thereof in their respective relationships with others is highlighted in their love lives as both Alfredo and Olmo cannot seem to hook up with the right woman to be with. In one encounter, Alfredo and Olmo attempt to have a threesome with a local prostitute only to have her go into an epileptic fit which stops the threesome sexual encounter before it begins.Alfredo marries a gorgeous, demure woman, named Ada (Dominique Sanda), while Olmo marries Anita (Stefania Sandrelli), a fellow left-wing idealist who, like him, shares in the enthusiasm of the cause of workers' rights in the vein of socialism. Ada, however, sinks into alcoholism when confronted with the reality of the emptiness of her relationship with Alfredo.Anita dies tragically in childbirth, bringing another member into the community; a daughter whom Olmo names after his late wife. As Olmo takes on his fateful role of leader among the poor farmers and their families, he clashes with Attila several times as the years go on. Olmo's daughter, Anita the Younger (Anna Henkel-Grönemeyer), grows into a young and resourceful teenager whom is supportive of her father's socialist beliefs.The power, however, shifts after World War II, and the ruling class is at the mercy of the jovial and bitter peasants in the agricultural estate. On April 28, 1945, as the padrone, Alfredo is captured by a teenage peasant boy carrying a rifle. Attila is also captured when he and his wife, the equally cruel and sadistic Regina (Laura Betti), try to flee the region. Attila is stabbed (non-fatally) several times by women wielding pitchforks and is imprisoned in the Berlinghieri pig sty. He is later executed by the peasants (while they cut off most of Regina's hair), who have discovered that Attila had raped and killed a young boy (ironically, the son of one of the most fervent supporters of fascism as an antidote to socialism) several years prior in a fit of rage and had also murdered a wealthy landowner's widow, Mrs. Pioppi (Alida Valli), during the winter of 1939 whose husband had been economically ruined by Alfredo, in order to steal her land and home.Alfredo is brought before Olmo's workers tribunal to stand trial. Many workers come forth and accuse Alfredo of letting them suffer in squalor while he (and his social class) profited from their labors and on top of that, he did nothing to stop the sadistic Attila. Alfredo is sentenced to death, but his execution is prevented after Olmo explains that the padrone is already dead even though Alfredo lives... that is, the social system has been overthrown with the end of the war. As soon as the verdict is overturned, however, representatives of the new government, which includes the Communist Party, arrive and call on the peasants to turn in their arms. Olmo convinces the peasants to do so, overcoming their skepticism. Alone with Olmo, Alfredo declares to him: ""The padrone is alive."""

C., flashlight beams are visible through the windows of an office. Security guard Frank Wills discovers a piece of masking tape covering a door latch in the garage, and calls the police to report a possible burglary. Inside an office, one of the burglars announces through a walkie-talkie, ""We're home."" On the receiving end is a man watching from an adjacent window, who warns them of ""activity."" Three undercover police enter the building and arrest the burglars.The next morning, Harry Rosenfeld (Jack Warden) and Howard Simons (Martin Balsam), editors at the Washington Post, briefly discuss the burglary, including the large amounts of cash, 35mm cameras and walkie-talkies found in the burglars' possession, and the fact that they invaded the Democratic Party's national headquarters. Reporter Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) asks to cover the story, but it is given to Bob Woodward (Robert Redford).Woodward attends the burglars' arraignment and is surprised to learn that they have private council. The burglars, James W. McCord, Bernard Barker and three others, have a Mr. Starkey as their private attorney, even though they hadn't contacted anyone since the arrest.Back at the office, Woodward, Rosenfeld and Bernstein discuss the information they've gathered: McCord had worked for the CIA, though the CIA denies knowledge of him. That night, a policeman calls Woodward concerning some entries found in the address books of two of the burglars, which include the names ""Howard Hunt"" and ""WHouse."" Woodward calls the White House the next morning and asks for Hunt; he is referred to the office of Charles Colson, special council to the President. When he finally reaches Hunt, Woodward's questions are greeted with shock and evasiveness.Woodward continues his investigation, and is ultimately given an unsolicited denial of Colson's involvement in the Watergate burglary from the White House. Simons, realizing that the story is of national interest, believes it should be covered by a top political writer, rather than an inexperienced youngster. Rosenfeld disagrees, and partners Bernstein with Woodward. Bernstein begins his research by interviewing Karen, a former employee of Colson's. She describes both Colson and Hunt as very secretive, but she learned that Hunt was investigating Senator Edward Kennedy on behalf of the White House, doing extensive research at the White House library.At the news room, Bernstein contacts the librarian, who corroborates Karen's story, then suddenly denies any knowledge of Hunt. Woodward calls Deputy Director of Communications Ken Clawson at the White House, who denies that the librarian spoke to Bernstein. The reporters take their investigation to the Library of Congress but find nothing. The resulting news story is lacking in hard evidence, and Executive Editor Ben Bradlee keeps it off the front page.From a phone booth, Woodward calls an anonymous man, who refuses to discuss Watergate. The next morning, Woodward finds a note from the man in his copy of 'The New York Times' instructing him to contact him by placing a small red flag from a flower pot at the balcony of his apartment building. That night at 2:00 am, Woodward takes a series of taxis to an underground parking garage, where the anonymous man (Hal Holbrook) is waiting. Woodward promises the man that his identity will remain secret, then recounts the details of the investigation. The man advises Woodward to ""follow the money.""A few days later, The New York Times uncovers evidence of the Watergate conspiracy dating back to March 1972. Bernstein travels to Miami, Florida, where State Attorney Dardis has subpoenaed Bernard Barker's telephone and money records. Dardis's file contains several checks from a Mexican bank, and one from a Florida Bank issued to Kenneth H. Dahlberg for $25,000.Woodward contacts Dahlberg, an officer with the Committee to Re-Elect the President (CREEP), who gave the check to CREEP finance chairman Maurice Stans, who in turn gave it to Barker. At a meeting of Washington Post editors, feelings are mixed about continuing the Watergate investigation, with Rosenfeld as the strongest advocate. One editor admits that he simply does not find the story believable.At their next conference, Woodward and Bernstein inform Bradlee and Simons that the General Accounting Office (GAO) has discovered a secret fund containing hundreds of thousands of dollars among CREEP's accounts. Woodward's anonymous source, now referred to as ""Deep Throat,"" points to the money as the key to the investigation. Bradlee is losing faith in the story, but Woodward and Bernstein are undaunted.
They acquire a list of CREEP employees and attempt to interview several in their homes. One woman tells them to leave before they are seen, and is in tears as she closes the door.The reporters continue to visit CREEP employees, but virtually all refuse to talk; Woodward and Bernstein suspect an organized cover-up. After two weeks, they still have no solid evidence. Rosenthal further discourages them with the news that the GAO report will not be released until after Nixon is re-nominated for president, and only Hunt, the five burglars, and CREEP operative G. Gordon Liddy will be indicted for the Watergate burglary. Bernstein continues his efforts to interview CREEP employees, using any excuse to get inside their houses. One woman, a CREEP bookkeeper, admits that she had long been aware of the secret fund and mentions a list of 15 names with a dollar amount next to each. The list was destroyed, however. She refuses to disclose the names of the men who control the secret fund but she will identify initials.As Woodward and Bernstein transform the bookkeeper's comments into a story, they discover that former Attorney General and CREEP chairman John Mitchell controlled the secret fund, along with Liddy, Bart Porter, Jeb Magruder, attorney to the President Herbert Kalmbach, and one other. When the reporters visit the bookkeeper again, she indicates that they are being watched.Woodward and Bernstein next visit Hugh Sloan, who recently resigned as CREEP treasurer as an act of conscience. Sloan states that all CREEP activities are approved by the White House, and estimates the amount of the secret fund at close to $1 million. The two reporters describe John Mitchell's criminal activities to Bradlee, Rosenfeld and Simons; Bradlee is aggravated by the fact that none of the sources can be named, but still approves the story. Bernstein calls Mitchell at home to read him the story, in case he'd like to comment on it. Mitchell responds with vulgarity and threats, and issues a statement the next day denouncing the story, without pointedly denying it.Bernstein travels to Los Angeles to interview Donald Segretti, a young lawyer who, under the supervision of CREEP operative Dwight Chapin, sabotaged the campaigns of several Democratic presidential candidates. Back in Washington that night, Woodward meets again with Deep Throat, who explains that the Department of Justice was well aware of the infiltration and sabotage of the Democrats. As Woodward leaves the underground garage, he suspects that he's being followed and starts to run, though no one is behind him.Woodward learns from an FBI source that Segretti was paid from the CREEP secret fund by Chapin, who was hired by White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman, suggesting that Haldeman is the fifth man who controls the fund. Woodward and Bernstein visit Sloan for confirmation of Haldeman's involvement, but rather than confirming the story, Sloan says he has ""no problem"" with it. Bernstein calls his source at the FBI, who confirms that ""John Haldeman"" controlled the fund. Woodward is not convinced, nor is Bradlee, but Bernstein gets further confirmation from a contact at the Justice Department and Bradlee runs the story. The following morning, Sloan denies implicating Haldeman, and the Nixon administration publicly denounces the Washington Post. The paper is barraged with criticism, and Bradlee is angered by his reporters' blunder, but he stands by the story.At Woodward's next meeting with Deep Throat, he learns that Haldeman runs the entire operation, Mitchell has the entire U. S. intelligence community involved in his covert operations, and the cover-up exists mainly to protect these covert operations. He is also told that he and Bernstein are under surveillance and their lives are in danger. Woodward heads to Bernstein's apartment and shares this new information via typewriter to keep their conversation from being heard. They wake up Bradlee at his home and disclose what they've learned from Deep Throat. Bradlee states that, even though half of all Americans have no interest in the Watergate affair, the future of the nation may be riding on it.In the final scene, Woodward and Bernstein are soon back at their typewriters, relentlessly working on the story as Nixon is sworn in for his second term on January 20, 1973. Sometime later, the Washington Post teletype reports the convictions and sentences of the conspirators, and Nixon's resignation from office on August 9, 1974."
tt0074156,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Thriller']","The story takes place on a Saturday day and night in Anderson, a crime-infested ghetto in South Central Los Angeles. Members of a local gang, called 'Street Thunder', have recently stolen a large number of automatic rifles and pistols. At 3:10 am, a team of heavily armed LAPD officers ambush and kill six members of the gang. In the morning, the gang's four warlords swear a blood oath of revenge, known as a ""Cholo"", against the police and the citizens of Los Angeles. Each man cuts his arm and bleeds in a glass bowl.That afternoon, CHIP Officer Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker) goes out for a drive. Over his CB radio, he is disappointed to learn that his first night as a CHP police lieutenant will be spent supervising the decommissioning of the Anderson precinct, aka Precinct 13.At 5:11 p.m., special agent Starker (Charles Cyphers) arrives at the Los Cruces prison to transport three prisoners to the state prison in Sonora, California. The warden (John J. Fox) introduces him to the convicts: Wells (Tony Burton), a muscular African-American man; Cornell (Peter Frankland), an ill and skinny white man; and Napoleon Wilson (Darwin Joston), a violent, psychotic death row inmate, shackled to a chair in his jail cell. The warden knocks Wilson off the chair without provocation, then leads him outside where Wilson wraps his chains around the Warden's legs and pulls him off his feet, forcing the Starker and the guards to restrain Wilson in gunpoint.Meanwhile, Lawson (Martin West) and his young daughter, Kathy (Kim Richards), drive by the Anderson precinct looking for Kathy's nanny's house. They pass the gang four leaders, who screw silencers onto their automatic weapons and go out looking for people to kill.Later, Bishop arrives at Anderson and meets his skeleton crew: Julie (Nancy Loomis), a switchboard operator; Leigh (Laurie Zimmer), a secretary; and Chaney (Henry Brandon), an elderly police sergeant. Bishop is briefed by the departing police captain that only two shotguns are left in the precinct and he will be relieved at 4 a.m.; the precinct will close at 10 a.m.Meanwhile, on the prison bus, Cornell has a coughing fit so bad that Starker orders the driver to go to the nearest police precinct.At 6:18 p.m., Lawson stops at a phone booth to phone for directions, while Kathy runs over to an ice cream truck. The ice cream driver (Peter Bruni) is distracted by a black car that keeps circling the block. After Kathy skips away with her ice cream, the driver is pulled out of the truck by the white gang leader (Frank Doubleday). Realizing she got the wrong flavor, Kathy comes back to the truck and is shot by the gang leader, who then fatally shoots the driver. Lawson finishes his call and sees Kathy lying by the truck. Cradling Kathy's body, Lawson sees the black car drive away and the driver lives long enough to tell him that the gun is in a holder next to the steering wheel. Lawson grabs it, gets into his car and chases after the gang.Meanwhile, the police bus arrives at Anderson, and a reluctant Bishop allows Starker to use the holding cells, while he calls a doctor.At 7:00 p.m., Lawson chases Kathy's killers into a field until they jump out of their car and run. Lawson kills the white gang leader, then realizes he is out of bullets, and runs to Anderson precinct. Collapsing at the front desk, Lawson is so traumatized that he can only say he is being followed. Ethan Bishop puts Lawson into the Captain's office and tries to call a doctor, but the phones and the lights suddenly go dead. Bishop at first believes it is an outside power failure, but the streetlights remain on. Starker decides to leave; however, when Chaney and Bishop step outside, Chaney is shot dead. Bishop runs back inside, and rushes to the holding cells, but is too late to prevent Starker, the two prison guards and Cornell from being gunned down as they step outside. Napoleon Wilson steals Starker's keys, but Bishop makes Starker give them to him after he gets Wilson and Wells back inside and into the holding cells.Salvos of bullets greet Bishop as he returns to the lobby. When the firing stops, he looks outside and sees everyone is gone. Leigh explains there is no rear exit to the building, and all the surrounding buildings are abandoned. As Bishop gives her his revolver and orders her to watch the windows, the gang's three remaining leaders appear throw the glass bowl of blood at the door and then lay a white sheet with the Street Thunder emblem on the front in front of the building before walking away. Sobbing, Julie pleads with Bishop to give the gang Lawson, but he refuses.The shooting resumes, and Bishop hands Leigh the cell keys, ordering her to free the prisoners. As she opens the cells, a thug breaks down the outside door and shoots her in her right arm. She smashes the man in the face with the key ring and opens the cell. She releases Wells and Wilson. Now unchained, Wilson dispatches another gang member who tries to stab him, and helps Leigh fights her way back to the lobby and barricades the door.During the assault, gang members smash through the windows. Bishop dons a rifle while he tosses Wilson a pump-action shotgun while Wells retrieves a gun from a slain gang member. Together, Bishop, Wilson, Wells and Leigh kill or wound more then a dozen gang members attempting to force their way into the building through the windows until they withdraw. When the fighting is over, they discover Julie is dead. Bishop notices an acetylene tank and exclaims that they could have been blown to pieces.Looking outside, Bishop sees that all the corpses have been removed to make it seem like nothing has happened. When Wells informs them he is leaving, Bishop stands in his way and Wells pulls his gun. Leigh steps between them, telling Wells he will be gunned down if he goes outside, then notices Wells is out of bullets. A quick check shows they have only eight bullets left (three in Bishop's rifle, three in Wilson's shotgun and two in Leigh's pistol).At 8:18 pm, remembering that a tunnel runs from the basement to a manhole in the parking lot, Leigh explains someone could crawl out, and go for help. The two prisoners play a game to decide who goes out and Wells loses. He crawls out, hot-wires a car and drives off. When Wells stops at a phone booth, a gang member sits up in the back seat and shoots him in the head.Out of options, Wilson recommends they retreat to the basement as it is easier to defend when they see the gang members in the distance gathering for a final assault. As they descend the stairs, carrying the still-comatose Lawson with them, Leigh asks Wilson why he did not try to escape and Wilson replies that there are only two things a man never leaves behind, one is a helpless man, but he does not say what the second is.Bishop decides to make a final stand in the basement hallway; he wraps some flares around the acetylene tank, explaining that when the gang attacks, he will shoot the flares to detonate the tank. He and Wilson will use a huge metal sign to shield them from the blast.Meanwhile, two policemen patrolling the neighborhood call for backup when they find a dead telephone repairman hanging from a pole.Back at Precinct 13, the gang attacks by throwing Molotov cocktails through the windows and finally break into the building and eventually head down into the basement, but Wilson and Bishop use clubs to force them back. Leigh shoots a gang member coming in from the sewer entrance. When the hall is full, Bishop shoots the tank with his final bullet and it explodes.Outside the burning police station, when more police officers arrive and secure the station, the surviving gang members retreat. Venturing down into the basement, the police officers find dozens of dead and badly burned gang members strewn in the hallway, and the only survivors are Bishop, Leigh, Wilson, and the comatose Lawson. When a policeman tries to handcuff Wilson, Ethan Bishop pushes him away and says it will be a privilege if Wilson will walk out with him. The two leave the smoking basement."
tt0074174,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Family', 'Sport']","Morris Buttermaker (Walter Matthau), an alcoholic and former minor-league baseball player, is recruited by a city councilman and attorney who filed a lawsuit against an ultra-competitive Southern California Little League which excluded the least skilled athletes (including his son) from playing. In order to settle the lawsuit, the league agrees to add an additional team - the Bears - which is composed of the worst players in the whole Little League. Buttermaker becomes the coach of the unlikely team, which includes (among others) a near-sighted pitcher, an overweight catcher, a foul-mouthed shortstop with a Napoleon complex, an outfielder who dreams of emulating his idol Hank Aaron, and a motley collection of other ""talent"". Shunned by the more competitive teams (and competitive parents), the Bears are the outsiders. They play their opening game, and do not even record an out, with the score at 26 to 0 before Buttermaker forfeits the game.Realizing the team is nearly hopeless, he recruits a couple of unlikely prospects: First up, is sharp-tongued Amanda Whurlizer (Tatum O'Neal), a skilled pitcher (trained by Buttermaker when she was younger) who is the 12-year-old daughter of one of Buttermaker's ex-girlfriends. At first, she tries to convince Buttermaker that she has given up baseball, but then she reveals that she had been practicing ""on the sly"". Before agreeing to join the team, Amanda makes a number of outlandish demands (such as imported jeans, modeling school, ballet lessons, etc.) as conditions for joining. Upon hearing her demands, Buttermaker asks, ""Who do you think you are, Catfish Hunter?"" Amanda responds by asking, ""Who's he?"" Rounding out the team, Buttermaker recruits the ""best athlete in the area,"" who also happens to be the local cigarette-smoking, loan-sharking, Harley-Davidson-riding troublemaker, Kelly Leak (Jackie Earle Haley). With Whurlizer and Leak on board, the team starts gaining more confidence, and the Bears start winning games.Eventually, the unlikely Bears make it to the championship game opposite the top-notch Yankees, who are coached by aggressive, competitive Roy Turner (Vic Morrow). As the game progresses, tensions are ratcheted up as Buttermaker and Turner engage in shouting matches, directing their players to become increasingly more ruthless and competitive against each other, going as far as fighting, spiking on slide, or the batter getting hit on purpose.The turnaround point of the game comes after a heated exchange between Turner's son (and Yankees pitcher) Joey (Brandon Cruz) and the Bears at-bat catcher Engelberg (Gary Lee Cavagnaro). Turner orders his son to walk Engelberg, the only Bears hitter he cannot overcome, despite Joey's wish to give it a try. In response, Joey intentionally throws a wild beanball nearly striking Engelberg in the head. Horrified, Turner goes to the mound and slaps his son. On the next pitch, Engelberg hits a routine ground ball back to Joey who exacts revenge against his father by holding the ball until Engelberg has an inside the park home run. Joey then leaves the game dropping the ball at his father's feet.Buttermaker - realizing that he has become as competitive as Turner - puts the benchwarmers on the field, thus giving everyone a chance to play. In spite of this, the finish-up brings up the best team-play from the Bears. After loading the bases with smart tactics (two walks and a bunt) they nearly recover a four run difference, with the last runner getting taken out at the last moment.Having narrowly lost the game at 7 to 6, Buttermaker gives the team free rein of his beer cooler. Although they did not win the championship, they have the satisfaction of having come a long way. The condescending Yankees congratulate the Bears (in a sarcastic tone implying that they really not mean it) telling them that although they are still not that good, they have ""guts."" Tanner, the shortstop, replies by telling the Yankees where they can put their trophy. The Bears cheer and Lupus overcomes his chronic shyness enough to yell ""Wait 'til next year!"", then they spray their beers all over each other. The movie ends with a field celebration by the Bears that makes it look as if they won the game."
tt0074190,"['Drama', 'Music', 'Mystery']","Vera Baxter (played by Claudine Gabay) is a married woman with children who ""lies a lot"" (as she says several times); to herself as much as to others. We learn that Vera follows around her husband Jean in what initially seems to be an odd but functional relationship, where he travels to a new town, rents a place and has affairs with young women. Vera always rents a place nearby, keeping the kids and having momentary affairs herself once in a blue moon, out of loneliness. Vera just had an affair with Michael Cayre (Gerard Depardieu), who has followed her to the new flat she's considering renting because he's fallen in love with her, but Vera isn't responding to his calls. We learn the inklings of all this at a bar where a Cayre, a lady bystander (only named L'inconnue; The Unknown) and Monique (one of Jean Baxter's lovers) are talking.
Monique arrives at the villa and has a casual but intense chat with Vera. They speak of themselves and their relationships with Jean. It's revealed that Monique has been sent there by Jean (who unknown to Monique, is busy entertaining a different young lady) to tell Vera that he's supposedly going on vacation to Spain with Monique, and not take Vera this time. Vera informs Monique this isn't the first time she's heard such a promise, and Monique leaves. Vera phones her husband Jean (played in voice only by François Périer), and the conversation turns to her suggesting divorce, which Jean seems distressed by but unable to address in any practical way.
L'inconnue (Delphine Seyrig) arrives at the villa and overhears the majority of the conversation before Vera hangs up. At first the woman says she's been sent by Cayre to bring Vera back to the bar, but things really open up when she points out that Vera can tell her anything, as they don't know one another and any secrets will be kept. Vera once again launches into a story of half-truths, which the visitor easily sees through. By pointedly questioning Vera, and information L'inconnue learned from her chat with Cayre at the bar earlier, the woman helps Vera see that Jean is a contemptible cad who's been using his wife to keep his failing building business ventures afloat. In fact, Jean owed a gambling debt to Cayre, and offered a night with his wife as payment. It's soon implied that all Vera's affairs have been as controlled by her husband as every other aspect of her life. Vera asks to be left alone but L'inconnue says she heard Vera admit to considering suicide during the phone conversation, and so won't leave. Vera gazes longingly at the views of the sea outside the villa and uncovers the visitor's lie that Cayre is still at the bar waiting for her return; when he's actually left from the shame of the arrangement that made them met in the first place. Then she asks why the woman is doing this. The visitor says that when she first heard the name 'Vera Baxter', she felt she wanted to be the woman that name belonged to. Though Cayre is gone, Vera now knows that another kind of love exists in the world, and a kindness that even the visitor seems capable of. They walk through the villa and with truth alive and lies put to bed, Vera decides to leave and find out what the outside world will be like beyond the protective but corrupting influence of her husband."

Inadvertently, one of the party goers pulls off Frannie's wig, revealing a peculiar baldness. Everyone stares in shock, and Frannie, appearing possessed, runs out of the cabin. As the party disperses, Jerry ""Zippy"" Zipkin (Zalman King), a bright but aimless Cornell University graduate, stays behind and searches the surrounding woods for his friend Frannie. Soon, he hears women screaming from inside the cabin and returns to find that Frannie has killed them. Transformed into a deranged, powerful madman, the zombie-like Frannie leaps at Jerry and chases him outside. Along a dark road, Jerry pushes Frannie in front an oncoming truck, and Frannie dies. Jerry escapes from the scene, but is shot in the arm by one of the truck drivers who mistakenly thinks Jerry is a killer. During the police investigation, the detectives also believe Jerry is responsible for the cabin murders, despite a statement from his girlfriend, Alicia Sweeny (Deborah Winters), that he is innocent.At a hospital, Jerry waits in the office of his friend Dr. David Blume (Robert Walden) and notices the various diplomas on the wall, including one from Stanford University. Blume cleans the gunshot wound, but is skeptical about Jerry's story that the injury was accident. Taking aspirin for a headache, Blume appears unwell, but says he is just overworked.At a park, Jerry reunites with Alicia who says he appears guilty by running from the police. After Jerry explains that he needs to find out why Frannie become a monster, he sees a newspaper headline about a Glendale detective, John O'Malley, who killed his wife and two children. The man has the same bald, psychotic appearance as Frannie. At the O'Malley residence, Jerry connects similarities between the crimes and notices another Stanford diploma on the wall. Jerry briefly talks with a middle aged woman (Alice Ghostley) who was a long-term neighbor of O'Malley who describes how one day O'Malley went crazy and killed his family.Next, Jerry breaks into Frannie's studio and discovers a psychedelic photograph featuring Edward Flemming (Mark Goddard), who is now a prominent politician running for Congress. The caption underneath the photo reads ""Blue Sunshine."" While Alicia waits nearby, Jerry interrupts Flemming on the campaign trail to tell him that Frannie has died. Flemming remembers Frannie immediately, but claims no knowledge of the words, ""Blue Sunshine.""Meanwhile, Wayne Mulligan (Ray Young), the campaign manager, flirts with Alicia and mentions that he and Flemming went to Stanford together. Suddenly, Detective Clay (Charles Sibert), who is investigating the cabin murders by following Alicia, recognizes Jerry and pursues him, but during the car chase Jerry manages to slip away. When they rendezvous later, Jerry tells Alicia that Flemming is not being honest about ""Blue Sunshine,"" which Jerry believes is somehow connected to Frannie's disease. As soon as Alicia realizes that Frannie, O'Malley and Flemming all graduated from Stanford ten years ago, Jerry remembers the diploma in Blume's office and rushes to the hospital.Through the window of the operating room, Jerry observes Blume as he becomes edgy while performing a surgical procedure. When Blume returns to his office, Jerry pulls his hair to see if it will fall out and explains that Blume might have a disease affecting Stanford classmates from ten years ago causing baldness and homicidal behavior. Although unacquainted with O'Malley and Frannie, Blume admits that he knows Flemming very well, after befriending him in college on account of Flemming's drug connections. Thinking back, Blume recalls the name ""Blue Sunshine"" because it was an LSD-like drug that he bought from Flemming, but never took. Unsure of the purity, Blume resold the dose to strangers for a small profit to help pay tuition. Calling it a time bomb, Jerry thinks ""Blue Sunshine"" is finally exploding in the chromosomes of those who took it ten years ago, but he needs a way to prove it. When Blume suggests obtaining a blood sample to test for genetic damage, Jerry says he needs a means of temporarily subduing the infected individual, who possesses uncommon strength. Although reluctant, Blume says he will try to obtain a tranquilizer.At a campaign event in the park, Mulligan runs into Alicia and continues to flirt. When a truck zooms past them, Alicia notices that Mulligan is easily agitated by the noise and holds his hair to protect it from the gust of wind. For the sake of Jerry's investigation, she agrees to meet Mulligan the following night during the campaign's final rally at a shopping mall. Later, Alicia contacts Lieutenant Clay and asks for his help in apprehending an individual at the mall, which might prove Jerry's innocence.Meanwhile, Blume nervously slips Jerry the tranquilizer drugs and tells him not to come by the hospital anymore, since he is a wanted man. Before Jerry leaves, Blume recalls Wayne Mulligan as a guy in college who always wanted LSD. Next, Jerry buys a gun, loads it with tranquilizer darts and learns from Flemming's staff that Mulligan will be at Shopper's World for the final campaign event.At a discotheque near the rally, Alicia greets Mulligan at the bar. Sweating, he says he does not feel well and goes to the bathroom. When Clay arrives, he finds Mulligan bent over the bathroom sink. As Clay pulls him up, Mulligan's wig comes off and he throws Clay against a stall. Marching through the disco, Mulligan pushes and hurls people across the floor.

Alicia takes shelter inside the glass-enclosed DJ booth, as Jerry arrives and unsuccessfully tries to fight off the superhuman zombie. When Alicia turns up the volume of the disco music, Mulligan screams in agony and leaves the room.Jerry chases Mulligan through a closed department store. After Jerry shoots him with a tranquilizer dart, Mulligan staggers and collapses. The film ends with Jerry standing guard over Mulligan while waiting for the police to arrive so Jerry can present Mulligan to them and therefor prove his innocence of all the killings and have a living proof person of the after effects of 'blue sunshine'.A series of on-screen texts reveal that tests reveal widespread abnormalities in Mulligan's chromosomes as a result of the exposure to the ""Blue Sunshine"", and he is currently incarcerated in a sanitarium.

Walker, the handyman, answers their knock at the door and lets them look around. Davey plays outside while Ben and Marion find a greenhouse full of dead flowers. Roz Allardyce, a woman in her late fifties, greets the Rolfs, and the couple informs her that Ben's Aunt Elizabeth will also be joining them for the summer. After Roz and Ben negotiate the oddly low, one-time rental price of $900, they are joined by Roz's wheelchair-bound brother, Arnold. The two siblings rave about how the house is ""practically immortal."" Also, Arnold and Roz tell the Rolfs that their 85-year old mother is living upstairs, and they will have to take food to her every day over the summer. Davey, bleeding, comes inside after being hurt. Everyone except Arnold leave to help Davey clean the cut. When Walker passes by to throw out a dead potted plant, Arnold tells him that the plant isn't dead. Surprisingly, Walker notices a new leaf is growing in the pot.A few days later, the Rolfs come back with seventy-four-year-old Elizabeth to find the mansion's key and a note saying that Arnold and Roz had to leave. Ben is upset that they didn't include a number where to reach them. Marion goes to the upstairs parlor and knocks on Mrs. Allardyce's bedroom door. Getting no answer, she draws back the parlor curtains to let more light in and admires a table full of old photos and a music box. Noticing a tray of dirty dishes, Marion carries them downstairs. Marion tells Ben she didn't see Mrs. Allardyce and then declares that the third floor is off bounds to everybody except her. The old lady will be Marion's responsibility. Elizabeth then declares that all the clocks in the house have stopped working.The next day, Ben and Davey restore a dilapidated pool, and then find the Allardyce family graveyard while exploring the surrounding woods. Ben notices there are no graves more recent than 1890. A week passes and still Mrs. Allardyce doesn't respond to Marion's knocking. Also, her tray is barely touched. Marion opens the music box and a dreamy expression crosses her face as the music plays.Meanwhile, Elizabeth, Davey and Ben are at the pool. Ben dives in and finds a pair of broken glasses that he puts on. Davey jumps in and, although the boy can't swim, Ben lets his son somersault off his shoulders. Suddenly, Ben thrusts Davey down and holds him under the water. Ben doesn't let go until Davey hits him in the face with his scuba mask. During the night, Ben dreams he is a boy and is being driven to his mother's funeral by a skeletal chauffeur with an evil grin.The next morning, Marion goes to the pool where she is shocked to see that it looks brand new. In the living room, Ben apologizes to Davey. That evening, Marion finds Ben by the pool, which she suggests that she polished up to look new. At Marion's cajoling, Ben jumps in and, a minute later, she strips down and joins him. They embrace, but Marion quickly pushes him away and gets out. Ben follows and tries to make love to his wife on the front lawn, but when Marion sees lights on in the old lady's room, she runs away.Going into the parlor, Marion opens the music box and falls asleep. The next morning in the kitchen, Elizabeth complains to Marion that the summer vacation is wearing her out. Elizabeth also notices the new gray growing in Marion's hair. Then, instead of taking a nap, Elizabeth brings Mrs. Allardyce a picture she has painted of the house. Elizabeth can barely climb the stairs without collapsing. Responding to Elizabeth's knocking on the parlor door, Marion says that Mrs. Allaradyce is asleep. Out front, Ben sees a model T hearse drive up that is being driven by the grinning chauffeur from his nightmare. Ben covers his face and, when he looks again, the hearse has disappeared.At midnight, all the clocks reset by themselves and chime the hour. Waking up, Ben smells gas coming from a heater in Davey's room. Ben kicks the locked door down and carries Davey out to a hallway window. After turning off the gas, Ben smashes out a stuck bedroom window with a baseball bat. In the morning, Elizabeth confesses to Marion that she was in Davey's room, but did not touch the gas. Marion demands to know what else Elizabeth did, as someone locked the door and closed the window. When Elizabeth wonders if Mrs. Allardyce did it, Marion explodes. Later, Ben finds Elizabeth crying in her room and looking twenty years older.

tt0074291,"['Biography', 'Drama', 'History', 'Romance']","The film opens with a carnival in Venice as a prelude to a series of erotic encounters that follow Giacomo Casanova through the cities of 18th-century Europe. The organizers of the festival attempt to raise a gigantic bust from the water; this fails, which is taken as a bad omen. Casanova is then introduced, as he visits one of Venice's islands to copulate with a fake nun for the pleasure of a rich voyeur; Casanova succeeds in entertaining him, but is frustrated that the man finds no interest in his research into alchemy and his further scheming. As he rows back to the mainland, Casanova is arrested, judged and imprisoned by the High Court over his famed debauchery. During his time in prison, Casanova reminisces of his affairs with a dressmaker and later on with one of her junior employees, Anna Maria, who suffers from frequent fainting and requires constant bloodletting. He eventually consummates his desire for Anna Maria. Back in prison, Casanova escapes through the roof and exiles himself from Venice, being taken into the Paris court of Madame d'Urfé. The Madame, an aged woman, enthralled by Casanova's apparent knowledge of alchemy, wishes to transform her soul into a man's through ritualistic intercourse with him (an act that requires the presence of a younger woman in the room, so that Casanova can get aroused). Fortuitously, Casanova encounters his brother, whose girlfriend he entices away. Casanova then moves to the court of a hunchback, Du Bois, in between taking charge of a beautiful girl-""the love of his life""-Henriette. Du Bois puts on a homosexual theatrical performance for his guests that unsettles some of them; Casanova is brought to tears as Henriette plays some music. The lovers vow fidelity to each other, but the following morning Henriette has disappeared. Du Bois informs Casanova that an emissary of a far-away court has reclaimed Henriette, and she's left a request that Casanova not attempt to follow her. While in London, Casanova is robbed by two women and he attempts suicide by drowning himself in the Thames. A vision of a giantess and two dwarfs distracts him; he follows them to a frost fair, where he arm-wrestles the giantess-a princess-and later pays to watch her bathe with the dwarfs. Casanova resumes his travelling the following day. He attends a deranged party at Lord Talou's palace in Rome, where he wins a bet with a stagecoach driver, Righetto, over how many orgasms he can have in one hour. The competition brings him higher acclaim. In Switzerland he falls in love with an alchemist's daughter, Isabella, who fails to keep an appointment to go to Dresden with him; Casanova instead partakes in an orgy within the hostel he's been stranded in. In Dresden, he has a brief chance encounter with his estranged mother in a theater. He then moves to a court in Württemberg, where his desire to be taken seriously as a writer/inventor is frustrated by the court's orgiastic, wild nature. It is here that he meets Rosalba, a mechanical doll with whom he shares a dance and later on goes to bed with. Time goes by and an old Casanova finds himself librarian to Count Waldstein at his castle in Dux. Life at the castle is more than frustrating for Casanova, as he is made to eat with other servants and does not get the respect nor the food he claims to deserve. Waldstein's manservant, Faulkircher, and his lover Vidarol, make him an object of mockery and animosity. A portrait of him is hanged and defecated on. Later on, during a fervent poetry recital, a court member fails to suppress a giggle at Casanova, who, humiliated and disappointed, goes back up to his room. The final scene has a weary, bloodshot Casanova cringing in an armchair and recounting a recent dream. In this dream, Casanova is back in Venice. He catches a glimpse of the giant bust seen in the beginning of the film, buried under thick layers of ice in the lagoon. He chases the ghosts of his past lovers, all of whom disappear. An ornate stagecoach beckons him to join its passengers. He finally meets with Rosalba, the mechanical doll, once again. They quietly dance with each other."

He is a drifter who has travelled in a ship hidden with the cargo and has to leg it when he's discovered. Asks for a job as stivadore but is refused in not friendly terms, in spite of being in front of a long list of waiting-to-be-filled jobs, so he wrecks the car of the person who denies him a position. Wilbur Walsh (Bud Spencer) arrives just minutes away from Kirby, and is told the same: or he belongs to the only available union or has nothing to do. He wrecks the new car of the manager. The managers asks for another new car to be brought in. The manager happens to be Fred ""Curly"" Cline (Luciano Catenacci), a criminal - which it has never been proved.Walsh and Kirby's paths meet while they are running from the police, called because of the wreckage of the cars. They have to make amends and leave the place together. They wreck the third car, this time making the manager do it himself, helped by some of his thugs. Walsh is reluctant even to speak to Kirby, but he pesters him. In fact, he ends up calling the psychiatrict ward telling them that a fat man is about to commit suicide jumping from a bridge. The male nurses arrive with a straight jacket but it's impossible for them to put it on Wilbur Walsh. He punches them and then, sees Matt Kirby looking at the ""show"".They finally go to a humble diner where they strike conversation with two motorbike road officers who suggest that they join the police force. They seem to agree, but it's just a way to be in good terms with the local police, as they intend to rob a local supermarket, because after so many adventures they have no money or job. They haven't got any weaponry, but Walsh intends to stick out a finger from inside one of his jeans pockets, so that the bulk looks like a gun. However, when they reach the intended location of the robbery, they find out that they have been tricked, and the flat belongs to the police themselves. They sit down as though they are waiting for their turn to be enlisted. The two road officers appear and offer to take them to the place of enlistment, actually saving Walsh and Kirby from ending up in jail themselves.Feeling trapped, they have no other option than to comply and enlist. Capt. McBride (David Huddleston) soon makes Kirby the apple of his eye. The day that their training is finished, McBride says that he won't accept any resignations before six months' time, unless somebody ends up dead in a body bag. Without speaking about it, both Kirby and Walsh decide that their only way is to be such bad police officers that McBride will expel them from the force.The frist thing Kirby does is to bamp onto another car, with such luck that two runaway criminals were inside. One of their workmates suggests to McBride that that was ""beginners' luck"", but McBride thinks that it's attention and talent for law enforcement. He makes Kirby the patrol boss.Kirby flirts with a Chinese girl, Susy Lee (Laura Gemser), who takes them to her home. She and her father show them the photograph about Susy's disappeared boyfriend.To be dismissed, Kirby and Walsh treat Lieutenant Governor (Edy Biagetti) very roughly because of speed limit surpassing, although he was not resisting. The important man complains to McBride, but that only makes McBride more interested in the new officers, praising them by radio. Walsh and Kirby are becoming the stars of the force in Miami.The criminals have to act: Kirby and Walsh are breaking the status quo. Fred Curly hires Geronimo (Luciano Rossi) to hurt them badly for six months. They don't want Geronimo to kill them because that would anger the whole police body, so it's better to make them need a wheelchair for six months. Geronimo and his thugs (Ottaviano Dell'Acqua, Alex Edlin...) fight Walsh and Kirby in the Miami rugby stadium. Kirby and Walsh win, obviously.After talking to the Chinese man again, they start wondering why they find him everywhere. He advises Walsh ""the big dragon"" to follow the advise of ""the little tiger"", but Walsh says that that has only brought him trouble. They find the two patrolmen of the beginning who are jealous of their ascendent on McBride.Through radio, a car breakdown is announced. Walsh doesn't want to go because he's just started a hamburger - he doesn't want to share with Kirby, but when Matt comes back to say that the occupants are two blondes in skimpy clothes, Wilbur runs there. The two blondes are Countess Galina Kochilova (Jill Flanter) and Angie Crawford (April Clough). Galina tells Angie to leave the ""big guy"" to her, making the audience imply that it's some kind of ambushment. The two ladies flirt with the two police officers. As they behave shamelessly, Wilbur Walsh mends their car fast. Angie tells about the Countess having a mansion in Miami, and invites them for the weekend. Galina cannot smoke the way she thinks countesses should smoke to save her life, so she gets frustrated. A butler Pierre (Emilio Delle Piane) opens the door and asks for Walsh and Kirby's hats, which they found strange. They are ridiculous in their Sunday-like clothes. The two young women appear in bikinis and take the plastic flowers from the two men. The girls go swimming in the pool, which gives Walsh and Kirby time to notice a photograph of Galina with red hair. Both realise the girls are prostitutes, and that they are in the house where there is going to be an ambush, probably organized by Fred Curly. The girls tell Pierre / Piero to make the men drunk during dinner. The two men show their bad table manners at all times. The two men make the girls and Pierre completely drunk, even when the butler says that he is a teetotaller. Bad manners go around the table at that time. Wilbur asks about the photograph, and Galina says that it is the photograph of her sister Princess Lexia, married to General Molotov, a relative of the inventor of the Molotov cocktails. The two police officers are the only sober people. In the morning, they reach the harvour, and they find suspicious movements in the ship cargo. They do not stay with the goods; they follow the leading car, reaching the same warehouse in the harvour from where they were kicked out at the beginning. Another road officer (Duilio Olmi) asks them what they are doing around there. They show them their badge and ask him to stick around just in case. They see a politician with a briefcase knocking the door with a password, and they take notice of it. They use it to enter the place, knocking the doorman down. Probably, the bowling alleys are just the front for some criminal business. Inside, it seems like there is a meeting. Inside the bowls, there are drugs, Fred Curly and some other minor criminals. The Chinese man who died at the beginning probably stole something unbeknowst that it was something much more important and dangerous than what he had thought about. They enter and tell everybody to put their hands up. One of the criminals realises that the guns are unloaded. The 18 criminals run after Kirby and Walsh. Puches come back and forth in the bowling alley. There is a stupid thug (Riccardo Pizzuti) which keeps on coming back to tell their bosses that he's seen some suspicious strangers. At that moment, McBride and many more policemen arrive to detain the criminals. McBride congratulates Walsh and Kirby. McBride tells Kirby to shave for the last time. McBride will let them quit after they have written their report. Kirby and Walsh bring present to the children of the Chinese family. They finally tell them that their relative is dead. They also give them some money for the education of the children. Walsh is angry because he's given all his money to that family. However, McBride asks for blood donations from the A-B Negative group because the two patrolmen of the beginning have been hurt, and they go to assist them."

Held at gunpoint, Harry agrees to the thieves' demand for a police car, then speeds his vehicle through the store window and shoots and kills the three assailants. Back at the police station, Captain McKay (Bradford Dillman) reprimands Harry for ""excessive use of force"" and transfers the inspector to the personnel department.Harry grudgingly saunters into an examination board for hopeful inspectors, where a representative from the mayor's office, Mrs. Grey (Jan Stratton), announces that she is monitoring the board to ensure affirmative action. When Harry grills applicant Kate Moore (Tyne Daly) about her inexperience, Mrs. Grey accuses him of intimidation.That night, Bobby Maxwell and his militant organization, which includes Miki the hitchhiker, drive the stolen Western Gas & Electric truck to the Hamilton Firearms Co., planning to rob the arsenal to for the sake of ""the people.""

As Maxwell stabs DiGeorgio in the back, the officer misfires and hits Miki. Although Maxwell's minion, Lalo (Michael Cavanaugh), tries to save Miki, Maxwell shoots her dead. The group steals off with the contraband, running over DiGeorgio's partner in the process. Harry and his colleague Lt. Bressler (Harry Guardino) rush to the hospital, where DiGeorgio reports with his dying words that the attacker was a pimp that he and Harry questioned in an unsolved murder years earlier.Back at the police station, Capt. McKay receives a cassette tape from Maxwell's group, which identifies itself as the 'People's Revolutionary Strike Force' and threatens to blow up buildings around the city unless they are paid $1 million. McKay, who believes the Strike Force is composed of black militants, reinstates Harry to the homicide division to work the case. Harry notes that Miki, who was found dead at the crime scene, was a known prostitute, and argues that the killer is a pimp, as DiGeorgio reported. Harry is chagrined to discover that his new partner is Kate Moore, the young woman he interrogated at the inspector interview.When Harry and Kate attend a LAW rocket demonstration, Harry pulls the naive Kate away from the launcher's backfire, saving her life. The inspectors then visit the coroner's office to learn that DiGeorgio's murderer used killing techniques indicative of Special Forces servicemen in the Vietnam War. As Kate grows squeamish and runs outside, a bomb detonates in the building's bathroom, prompting Harry and Kate to chase a Strike Force operative named Henry Lee Caldwell (Tim Burris), whom Harry vaguely recognized on his way inside. During the pursuit, Caldwell drops his briefcase in a dumpster, but Kate retrieves it as Harry follows the militant across apartment rooftops. Caldwell falls through a skylight, lands on the set of a pornographic film and gets away until Harry detains him at a church.Sometime later, Harry delivers the dynamite that was stashed in Caldwell's briefcase to Lt. Bressler, who reports that the ""suspect"" is a member of the black militant group Uhuru, lead by Big Ed Mustapha (Alpert Popwell). Harry and Kate visit Mustapha's headquarters, where Kate fends off aggressive men while Harry learns that Caldwell left Uhuru to ""go white,"" joining the criminal organization of a fellow Vietnam veteran. Noticing that Mustapha's office is filled with stolen artifacts, Harry threatens to bust the radical leader for robbery unless he provides information about Caldwell's organization. Mustapha negotiates for the prison release of an Uhuru member, then reviews Harry's list of names which includes all of the pimps that he and DiGeorgio once interviewed; Mustapha identifies Bobby Maxwell as Caldwell's new leader. After Harry and Kate leave, Capt. McKay, Lt. Bressler and a SWAT team surround Mustapha's building and load Uhuru members into a paddy wagon.Later, McKay strategies with the mayor to credit Harry and Kate to for the Uhuru arrests, noting that the commendation of a female inspector will impress the electorate. When Harry realizes that Uhuru is being blamed for Hamilton Firearms Co. theft, as well as the ensuing threat of violence and the blackmail, which has now been increased to $2 million, he refuses to participate in the publicity stunt. As Harry states his case to the mayor (John Crawford), McKay suspends him and Kate runs after her partner, offering support. Harry lets down his guard, reporting that Maxwell, their primary suspect, will be impossible to find without Mustapha, and Kate suggests they post Mustapha's bail.Sometime later, Maxwell's Strike Force kidnaps the mayor after a San Francisco Giants baseball game by ambushing his limousine and raising the China Basin Bridge so he cannot escape. That evening, Maxwell's girl friend and second in command, Wanda (Samantha Doane), telephones a local radio station to announce the Strike Force's demands, leaving a cassette tape in the phone booth. After listening to the tape, which sets a $5 million ransom for the mayor, Capt. McKay and Lt. Bressler find Harry in a pool hall and demand cooperation, but Harry refuses their plan to negotiate with the terrorists.Harry later meets with Mustapha, who identifies the Strike Force and leads him to Wanda, who works as a masseuse. At the massage parlor, which fronts as a brothel, Harry learns that Wanda has left her job to become involved with a church, lead by Father John (M.G. Kelly). Kate later briefs Harry about the militant, radical priest, who gave rehabilitation seminars at San Quentin State Prison while Maxwell was an inmate.At John's church, Harry bullies the priest for information as Wanda, dressed as a nun, aims her gun from behind; however, Kate appears in the pews and shoots Wanda dead, saving her partner's life. Distressed by the violence, Father John tells the detectives that the mayor is being held hostage at Alcatraz.The inspectors take a boat to the abandoned prison island and a gunfight ensues. After finding the mayor and shooting his captor, Kate shields the politician from Maxwell and his henchmen. As she reunites with Harry, she warns her partner that Maxwell is aiming from behind and is caught in the crossfire, herself. As Kate dies, she urges Harry to carry on without her. Although Maxwell resumes control of the mayor and leads him up an observation tower, Harry pursues them from a distance with a LAW rocket. As Maxwell leaves the mayor on a lower floor to look for Harry from the top, Harry launches the rocket and kills Maxwell. Disinterested in the pompus mayor's promise of commendation, Harry stands over Kate's body as Capt. McKay arrives by helicopter. Unaware that the standoff has ended, McKay announces to Maxwell that he is delivering the Strike Force's $5 million ransom."
tt0074486,"['Fantasy', 'Horror']","The film starts with a man named Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) hovering in space. His brain, represented by a rocky planet visible through his head, hovers behind him. On the rocky planet's desolate surface, there is an overhead view of a building with a large hole in the roof. In the building sitting by a window with broken glass there is a Man in the Planet (Jack Fisk) who pulls levers to control Henry's functions which represents his central nervous system. This scene is going to represent Henry having sexual intercourse with a woman named Mary X (Charlotte Stewart). Henry's mouth opens and a spermatozoon slides its way out, then rests erect at Henry's side. The Man in the Planet pulls several levers and launches the sperm into a water hole which represents the vagina of Mary X. Some time passes and a creature is born in the depths of blackness and rises to the surface.The next scene starts with Henry looking at the camera. He then proceeds to walk home to his apartment through a slum in an industrial wasteland carrying a small brown paper bag. Henry stumbles past factories with heavy machinery roaring. There is carnival music heard in the distance, but there are no people or automobiles around anywhere. The sounds of a steam whistle, as well as a horn of a cargo ship are heard among the loud sounds of the machinery.When Henry gets to the lobby, he checks the mail and finds there is none. He then takes the elevator up to his apartment which is Room 26. Before he gets inside, the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall (Judith Anna Roberts), who lives in Room 27, informs him that Mary X called from the payphone in the hallway and invited him to dinner. While in his apartment, Henry turns on some lights, sets down the brown paper bag containing paper-wrapped groceries, puts on light jazz music from a record player, takes off his shoes and puts one of his socks on the radiator since it was wet from stepping in a puddle while walking home. While sitting on his bed, he then stares at the hissing radiator which represents thoughts of suicide. We see that there are electrical wires around the radiator. He glances out at the only window in his one-room apartment which only has a view of a brick wall of another building across the alleyway, symbolizing his claustrophobic, prison-like setting. In the background is a small picture of a mushroom cloud which shows the setting to be a post-apocalyptic future. He then throws a stone in a pot of water in his dresser which is meant to be a superstitious gesture, and looks at a torn picture of Mary.That evening after dark, Henry walks over to Mary's house through the industrial wasteland and through a railroad yard to meet her family and have dinner. Before he goes in, they mention Henry and Mary's strained relationship. While Henry is talking with Mrs. X (Jeanne Bates) in the living room, it's revealed that Henry works as printer at LaPell's Factory, but is ""on vacation"". Henry meeting the family is portrayed as very awkward throughout the scene. While Henry and Mary wait in the living room, Mary's father (Allen Joseph) works on cooking artificial chickens baking in the oven, while Mary's mother fixes a salad. An elderly woman, the Grandmother (Jean Lange), sits motionless in the kitchen. The family attempt to eat the artificial chickens and salad but everything goes wrong when the chickens start twitching and bleeding when Henry tries to carve them. After dinner, Mrs. X interrogates Henry about whether or not he had pre-marital sexual intercourse with Mary. He confirms that they did and it's revealed that Mary had a deformed, premature baby. Mrs. X orders that they must get married as soon as possible and pick up the baby from the hospital.The next scene cuts to sometime later after they get married and get the mutated, alien baby home. Henry goes down to the lobby and checks the mail to find a small worm in a stylish black box. Henry hides this from Mary first in his pocket and later in a cupboard next to the bed. He gets home and contemplates suicide again, this time more seriously.During the night, as Henry and Mary sleep, the baby cries continually. The sounds of a raging thunderstorm is heard from outside as well as sounds of more factory machinery and rumblings of a freight train are heard. Mary can't stand it and tells Henry that she is going back home, leaving Henry to deal with the baby.The Beautiful Girl Across the Hall is seen returning to her apartment in a disheveled state after an apparently bad date. (It is implied that she may be a prostitute).Over the next few days, Henry has trouble sleeping and hears the baby stop crying. He gets out of bed to check its temperature and after the temperature reads fine he looks back at the baby seeing that it is covered in sores and apparently sick. After he sets up a vaporizer, the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall comes over and seduces him and they literally melt into the bed. The Girl sees the mutated baby nearby crying.The lady in the radiator (Laurel Near) appears again on a stage singing ""in Heaven everything is fine"" while mutated worms (symbolizing sperm) fall from the ceiling and she steps on them. Henry goes on stage and a dead tree in some dirt is wheeled out which makes him appear uneasy and he steps to the side of the stage where he acts agitated. As he plays with a railing staring off into space, his head pops off and the crying mutated baby takes its place. His head forms a pool of blood and eventually falls into it, re-appearing out of the sky and landing in an alley in the industrial wasteland.A little boy (Thomas Coulson) sees Henry's severed head on the ground and takes it away with him to an eraser factory. When the boy arrives, Paul, (Darwin Joston), the taciturn mechanic working at the front counter, buzzes his ill-tempered Boss (Neil Moran) to the front where the Boss takes the little boy with Henry's severed head through another door and to a pencil machine operator (Hal Landon Jr.) in another back room where Henry's head is made into erasers for pencils.Upon waking up from the nightmare, Henry hears something outside his apartment. He then sees the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall being intimate with a man named Mr. Roundheels (Raymond Walsh). When he gets back inside his apartment, the baby makes strange cackling sounds as though it's laughing at Henry. Henry, apparently agitated moves over to the baby and begins to cut off the bandages covering its body causing the baby to breathe heavily. To Henry's horror, the baby's body splits open as it was either too fragile or Henry had cut into it. Henry decides to stab into the baby's heart with the scissors and collapses on the other side of the room. The baby's innards flow over the electrical wires which then produce sparks and short-circuit the lights. He sees the baby's head hovering about on a now very long neck, as the lights flicker in and out the baby's head becomes gigantic and it engulfs the camera.The man in the planet is seen pulling a lever and apparently being electrocuted. In the final shot, we see Henry standing in some kinds of white afterlife and embrace the woman in the radiator.================================================================================Alternate synopsis and possible reason for the weirdness:It is an alternate world in the early 1970's. The United States was attacked by either the Japanese or Russians in the late 1940's or early 1950's; the Japanese having revenge for what we did in World War 2 or the Russians fulfilling our Cold War paranoia. As a result, over 95% of the population was wiped out. Little or no attempt was made to rebuild America and technology was halted to a standstill. It would appear that all electricity seems to be run on steam generators and factories are self-running. Henry lives in a 1940's era apartment with a 1978 record player and iron frame bed. And the X home looks like a relic of that era as well.It is set in a small industrial town on the outskirts of Philadelphia or a small town in Pennsylvania in the early 1970's. The population of the town is probably no more than 100 people. Henry Spencer was a child when the atomic war happened. As a result of radiation poisoning and the trauma of the attack, he was socially awkward, prone to frequent hallucinations and fantasy worlds, and with autistic traits. The X family has many forms of mental illness. Mr. X is manic depressive/bipolar, Mrs. X is schizophrenic, Mary with epileptic fits and clinical depression, and Mrs. X's mother with dementia that became catatonia.Because nearly all animal life was wiped out, nearly all food is synthetic or genetically modified.As for the baby, 20 plus years of radiation poisoning had modified Mary's reproductive system. Bringing a child into the world has been discouraged for the past 20 years.The lady in the radiator, man in the planet, and his head being made into erasers are all illusions Henry has for his miserable existence. At the end, he kills the baby, then presumably kills himself, but to him, it appeared the baby ate him and he ended up in heaven with the woman of his dreams."

He presses her, saying that he wants her to have Heather's face, and promises to give her 2 and a half million dollars, half of the inheritance. He tells her that Thorndike loved Heather as much as he hated him, as he blamed Phillip for the death of his only daughter, Jenny. Jane has to learn the life and identify of the people who have met Heather. The only problem is that Heather was an excellent pianist, having played with the Atlanta Symphonic Orchestra at 16.

tt0074512,"['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","In the opening scene, ""Madame"" Blanche Tyler (Barbara Harris) holds a seance in the elegant Victorian home of Mrs. Julia Rainbird (Cathleen Nesbitt), the elderly matron of a wealthy family. Blanche's falsetto ""trance"" voice becomes a deep growl as she channels her spirit guide, Henry, who indicates a reluctant presence in the room. Julia believes it is her deceased sister, Harriet, who gave birth to an illegitimate son over 40 years earlier. His estrangement from the Rainbirds weighs heavily on Julia's conscience. She offers Blanche $10,000 to locate the missing heir, as a private investigator might draw attention to this family embarrassment. Blanche walks calmly to an awaiting taxi, driven by her boyfriend, George Lumley (Bruce Dern). Once inside, she tells him that, with the help of Henry, she has secured a lucrative assignment. George reminds her that she is ""as psychic as a dry salami,"" and is guided by his research, not Henry. She dismisses his comments as jealousy, but asks him to continue his investigation of the Rainbirds. George refuses, until Blanche tells him about the $10,000, which puts him in an amorous mood. When he takes his eyes off the road for a few seconds, the car narrowly misses a tall blonde woman dressed in black clothing and wearing dark sunglasses.The woman (Karen Black) enters a police station with a pistol. She is given a large diamond, then hands the detectives a written note, assuring them that her hostage, Victor Constantine, will be returned unharmed. The detectives lead the woman to a helicopter. She communicates using hand gestures, and when the pilot doubts that her gun is loaded, she shoots a hole through the plexiglass. After the helicopter lands on a golf course, the woman walks to a wooded area, where her male accomplice waits with Constantine (Nicholas Colasanto). The pilot runs to the woods as the kidnappers, Arthur Adamson (William Devane) and his wife, Fran, drive away.Inside the car, Fran complains about her six-inch high heels as she removes her hat and blonde wig, but also assures Arthur that she made no mistakes. Arthur smugly reminds her that the police will be looking for a tall blonde woman. He also indicates that he is planning another kidnapping. After returning home, they clean the secret room in the basement that held Constantine. Fran and Arthur find danger to be an aphrodisiac, and before they retire to the bedroom, Arthur hangs the diamond on the crystal chandelier near the staircase, where it will never be noticed. The next day, Constantine is questioned in his office by FBI Agent Sanger (Martin West) and a few police detectives, but is unable to describe the kidnappers.Meanwhile, Blanche gives a psychic reading to Ida Cookson, a close friend of Julia's. She wants to contact Michael, the Rainbird's deceased chauffeur, who facilitated the adoption of Harriet's son. George signals Blanche from the kitchen, and she feigns a trance as she leaves the living room. He needs her car for a meeting with Vera Hannagan, Michael's daughter.At a department store counter, George, under his alias Frank McBride, Esq., questions Vera (Marge Redmond), who tells him about her father's friend, Harry Shoebridge, and his wife, Sadie, who after several miscarriages, moved to a town called Barlow Creek and adopted an infant boy whom they named Eddie. Both later died in a house fire, and the son may have died with them.George finds the graves of the three Shoebridges at the Barlow Creek cemetery, all of whom died in 1950. He asks the gravedigger why the son's stone looks so much newer than that of his parents, and why there are two graves for three people. The gravedigger ignores George's questions and returns to work.George next visits Mr. Wheeler (Charles Tyner), the engraver, who made the stone for Eddie Shoebridge in 1965. Wheeler remembers that it was purchased by a tow-truck driver, and that people blamed Eddie for the death of his parents, especially because his grave is empty.At the County Registrar's office, George learns that a mechanic named Joseph P. Maloney (Ed Lauter) applied for Eddie's death certificate, which was denied.George parks across the road from Maloney's gas station for several minutes before entering. Maloney is openly suspicious, and when George questions him, Maloney admits nothing and copies George's license plate number as he drives away. Later, Maloney appears at Arthur's jewelry store, greeting the jeweler as ""Eddie."" Arthur leads him to the office, assuming that Maloney once again needs money. Maloney informs Arthur of George's visit, and that he has traced the car to Blanche's address. He offers to kill George and Blanche, just as he killed the Shoebridges at Arthur's request 26 years ago. As Arthur declines the offer, he is called away by a pair of police detectives inquiring about the ransom diamond, of which Arthur admits no knowledge. When he returns to his office, Maloney is gone and the window is open.That night, Arthur and Fran drive to Blanche's home, where they overhear George and Blanche arguing about sex, the search for Eddie Shoebridge, and a large sum of money. Fran suggests that the latter might be the reward offered for Constantine's kidnappers. Later, at the Rainbird home, Blanche reveals all of the information George has gathered, with Henry getting the credit. Julia remembers that Bishop Wood (William Prince), who baptized Harriet's child, might have more information. George attends the bishop's Sunday service, as does Fran, disguised as an older woman. She faints in front of the bishop, while Arthur, disguised as a deacon, sedates him. The kidnapping proceeds without interference. In the car, Arthur expresses his lifelong resentment toward the bishop, while congratulating himself on his brilliant plan. They agree that George's presence was no coincidence, and Arthur decides to have Maloney kill George and Blanche, despite Fran's disapproval.That afternoon, Maloney calls George and Blanche, claiming to have information on Eddie Shoebridge. They are to meet him at a diner in a remote, mountainous area. Blanche insists that they go, ignoring George's reservations. They arrive at the diner and wait inside, while Maloney quietly sabotages Blanche's car outside. After several beers, they decide to leave. As George navigates the car down the winding mountain road, brake fluid leaks from the rear wheels. Blanche panics as George narrowly misses oncoming vehicles and steep cliffs before running the car off the road, where it lands on its side. Neither is injured, although Blanche is standing on George's face. As they walk back up the road, Maloney drives by, offering a ride. George declines, knowing that Maloney sabotaged the car. Maloney leaves, but quickly returns with the intent of running over George and Blanche. He swerves to avoid an oncoming car, drives off a cliff, and dies in a fiery wreck.The next day, Fran enters Arthur's jewelry store, posing as a customer. She updates him on the bishop's ransom and delivers the news of Maloney's death, which makes Arthur smile. When he demands that she collaborate on the murder of George and Blanche, she is horrified and leaves.At Maloney's funeral, George forces Mrs. Maloney (Kathleen Helmond) to reveal Arthur's true identity. George informs Blanche, who begins her search without his assistance as he has to take a day-long shift at the taxi company. When she arrives at Adamson's Jewelry Store, Blanche convinces Mrs. Clay (Edith Atwater), the clerk, to give her Arthur's home address, which she includes in a note for George.At the Adamson house, Arthur and Fran are about to deliver the bishop when Blanche rings the doorbell. Believing she has left, they continue their preparations. The garage door opens as Blanche passes, and she excitedly tells Arthur about his inheritance, until Fran opens a car door and reveals the unconscious bishop. Blanche is trapped, and after a struggle, she is sedated and locked in the secret room. The Adamsons, convinced that Blanche's whereabouts are unknown, carry on without concern.While they drive home with their new diamond, George arrives at the house searching for Blanche. He enters through a basement window and hides when the Adamsons return. George overhears Arthur's plans to stage Blanche's ""suicide,"" despite protests from Fran. He quietly follows Arthur to the basement, where he wakes Blanche after Arthur leaves. When the Adamsons return for Blanche, she escapes and George locks them inside the hidden room. Thrilled as they are about the reward, George is sure that it would be increased if they can locate the diamonds. Blanche goes into a trance and leads George to the diamond hidden in the chandelier, convincing George that she is truly psychic. As he phones the police, Blanche winks and smiles at the viewers, thus breaking the fourth wall."

After being offered some obnoxious instruments, Johan and the King angrily send off the merchant, who accidentally leaves behind one of the instruments offered - a peculiar flute with only 6 holes! When Peewit almost takes notice, Johann and the King sneak the flute off into the castle to destroy it before he can find it. They throw it in the King's fireplace, but the fire emanates green smoke that permeates the King's room! Peewit is among those who try to put the fire out, and much to the dismay of Johan and the King, he finds the flute in the ashes. But once Peewit cleans the flute and goes around the kingdom playing it, he is delighted to make a surprising discovery; once played, the flute causes anyone who hears it to dance uncontrollably and subsequently pass out from exhaustion. Just as Peewit is enjoying tormenting everyone with this newfound gift, the same merchant as before is offering instruments to the owner of a bar in town. When he is worried to notice (and mentions) that the odd 6-holed flute he had was missing, he is overheard by a shady bearded fat man named Matthew Oilycreep (AKA: Matthew McCreep), who makes inquiries about the flute to the merchant, who recalls that he dropped it at the front of the kingdom while offering it to Peewit. Without a word, Oilycreep swiftly rides to the kingdom, where a big royal feast is being held, and a group of minstrels are playing for the kingdom (with Peewit unsuccessfully trying to get involved). Already invited as a guest, Oilycreep meets Peewit, who takes him to his room and shows him, as well as playing, the magic flute (but not before two mysterious tiny blue people, riding on a stork, unsuccessfully try to sneak it away from his room). Oilycreep asks Peewit to let him play it for a while. Peewit advises him beforehand to stop playing when he says so. But just as Oilycreep is about to play the flute, we cut to the minstrel band at the feast, and Oilycreep swiftly rides away into the dark.The very next morning, a very enraged Peewit is tied up in his room. The King's advisor Lady Prattle, concerned and shocked, goes to untie him, and Peewit then goes berserk, furiously running around and chopping objects with an axe. Upon bumping into Johan and the King, Peewit complains that Oilycreep has stolen his magic flute! The King doesn't take this seriously at first, but Johan intuitively knows how serious the situation is, and Peewit claims that Oilycreep will use the flute to rob people. Johan and Peewit jump into action, searching from kingdom to kingdom, while Oilycreep, of course, begins using the flute to steal the riches from the people, piling them up in his wagon! (During the confusion, the aforementioned tiny blue people again try and fail to retrieve the flute.) But once our two heroes finally confront him, Oilycreep plays the flute and makes short work of Johan and Peewit, leaving them behind. The two realize that as long as Oilycreep has the flute, he is unstoppable, so Johan decides to consult with a magic-savvy friend of his - the wizard Homnibus.While performing magic spells in his home, Homnibus is surprised to see Johan and Peewit, who are shown in by his young assistant Oliver. Over dinner, Homnibus regrets that he has no solution to breaking the spell of the flute, and says that the only ones who may know are the original makers of the flute, the ""Smurfs."" Although Homnibus does not know exactly where the Land of the Smurfs is, he decides to perform a spell on them called ""hypnokinesis,"" in which they will be put into a deep sleep, and their bodies will be spiritually copied over to another area (similar in concept to The Matrix (1999)). Once this spell is performed on Johan and Peewit, they awaken in a beautiful forest in the Land of the Smurfs. They meet one of the Smurfs, a tiny blue humanoid creature (just like the ones who tried to retrieve the flute), roughly 5 to 6 inches tall, wearing white pants & working cap. (And most of the time he speaks, a magic chime is heard in his voice.) The Smurf takes our two heroes to the Smurf Village, and find that the Smurfs are all nearly identical in appearance (and are 100 years old), except for their patriarch, Papa Smurf (who is 542), who has a white beard and wears red pants & cap in lieu of white, and the houses they live in are big mushrooms, the tallest ones are nearly as big as Johan. In the Smurfs' own language, nouns and verbs are replaced with the word ""smurf."" Putting it in song, Papa Smurf states that although all the Smurfs look the same, they can each be identified by their personalities, and introduces nearly a dozen of them: Greedy Smurf, Poet Smurf, Farmer Smurf, Lazy Smurf, Handy Smurf, Clumsy Smurf, Festive Smurf, Grouchy Smurf, the bespectacled Brainy Smurf (the only Smurf to look remotely different from the rest), and Hefty Smurf. Returning to urgent affairs, Johan asks Papa Smurf for a way to break the magic effect of the flute. While he regrets that is impossible, he has a better idea: to build a new magic flute, so Peewit can fight with Oilycreep on equal terms. The Smurfs get to work immediately, and all through the night, they chop down a special tree in the forest (at the center of which is the part needed to make the flute). While the Smurfs get to work on carving the flute from the wood, a song number ensues in which a bored Peewit realizes that he can ask for a glass of water as ""a smurf of smurf."" Johan is laughing in amusement at this, as the Smurfs cannot understand him, and bring him the wrong things, until they finally give him a glass of water, upon which a stressed-out Peewit angrily changes his mind! A while later, the new flute is finished, but Festive Smurf wants to throw a big party for their hard work, which they do, later that night, in the Smurf Village. After a very cheerful party with music, fireworks, and food, Papa Smurf is just about to give Johan and Peewit the new flute, until they are suddenly awakened from their sleep too soon by Homnibus, who was very worried, as they were asleep for 2 days! When they demand to be sent back, Homnibus tries the spell again, but is exhausted from his efforts and gets a headache, for which he must get rest. While Oliver tends to the wizard, Johan and Peewit are frustrated, worried about what Oilycreep is doing at that moment...At the same time, Oilycreep rides to the bleak kingdom of his crooked associate Lord Mumford (AKA: Earl Flatbroke), to whom he makes a fascinating proposal: For all the riches he stole from the people, Oilycreep wants to gather an army against the King's castle. He proposes to sail from the Port of Tromanack (AKA: Terminack) to an undisclosed island, where he will recruit men for his army. Unbeknownst to them, the same two Smurfs (who tried to get the flute back from Oilycreep earlier) were listening. Meanwhile, a dejected Johan and Peewit, still in Homnibus' home, are somewhat relieved to hear from Oliver that the wizard is nicely recovering, but is asleep. But miraculously, the Smurfs (riding storks; their means of travel) arrive in front of Homnibus' home. Papa Smurf, aware of what happened, personally presents the flute to Peewit, and much to the dwarf's delight, the flute works (having tested it on Johan)! After the two scout Smurfs intervene with news on the whereabouts and plans of Oilycreep, our heroes race to the Port of Tromanack, only to see that Oilycreep has just disembarked. Later, Papa Smurf (along with three other Smurfs he selected for this mission) comes to a despondent Johan and Peewit at the port, telling them that someone knows where Oilycreep is heading, and backtracks to Lord Mumford. This gives Johan an idea, and a short time later, Lord Mumford gets a letter, supposedly from Oilycreep (actually a forgery from Johan), telling him to meet him at the secret island. He then rides to the Port of Tromanack, and he, along with three sailors (two of which are a disguised Johan and Peewit), and the Smurfs in hiding, set off...During the voyage, Peewit is obnoxiously seasick, making a spectacle of himself on the boat (with Johan sarcastically teasing him). Eventually, they make it to the island, on which is a big village full of overindulgent people. Lord Mumford goes to a bar to meet Oilycreep, who is surprised to see him, and is puzzled at the letter he got that he didn't write. When they went to look for the sailors of the boat to find out who's responsible, Johan and Peewit look around town for the two villains. The duos finally cross paths, and without a word, both Peewit and Oilycreep immediately begin their duel of the flutes, and the resulting musical noise is so powerful it causes everyone in town (even Johan and Lord Mumford) to dance! At the end of the cataclysmic musical duel, both men are exhausted and out of breath, until Peewit has enough strength to blow out one last note that finishes Oilycreep, and then reclaims the other flute as well, thus emerging the victor.Having won the battle, Johan, Peewit, and the Smurfs return to the kingdom, bringing Oilycreep and Mumford to face justice, and return all the riches to the people. Peewit wants to keep the magic flutes, but Johan firmly stresses that both flutes must be returned to the Smurfs. Thus, Peewit secretly tries to carve a fake flute, so he can give it to the Smurfs while he keeps one of the real ones. Before the Smurfs go back home, they appear before the King. Johan and Peewit personally return the flutes to Papa Smurf, who thanks them for doing the right thing, as the flutes in their possession would only bring them trouble. One of the Smurfs even suggests that Johan and Peewit may have further adventures with them in the future (which, in the comics and even the Hanna-Barbera animated series, they do). As the Smurfs fly for home on their storks, everyone waves goodbye to them from the top of the castle, but behind everyone, Peewit begins to play what looks like the magic flute, and nothing happens. Peewit kept his fake flute by mistake, and gave the real one to the Smurfs! He throws a tantrum as we pan away from the top of the castle and the credits roll."

I remember he is an alcoholic with a ridiculous excuse for being one, namely that he saw his father drink one shot glass of whiskey every night by gulping it and so grew up thinking there is no way to drink except by gulping, though he consumes more than one glass. (What's your excuse?) And that he is blacklisted---did somebody rat him out in retaliation?"
tt0074567,['Drama'],"After a considerable period of unemployment, 24-year-old Joseph Marti is offered a position as a clerk in the technical office of the engineer and inventor C. Tobler, of Bärenswil. Tobler has invested his entire fortune in inventions that have failed to attract anyone's attention. In addition to taking dictation of what are for the most part high-flown pleas for assistance, Marti's duties include a range of household chores and services to his master's family. To this end he is given the tower chamber as his digs, where he spends his leisure time cursing his fate, developing his skills of resistance and rebellion and rehearsing in his mind the shy, confused moments he has spent with the young Mrs Tobler.
The viewer is drawn into the slow fall of the house of Tobler, into the pointlessly lavish round of parties, and suffers along with the assistant as he is subjected to a series of brutal psychodramas by Tobler, who is in the process of being mentally outstripped by his employee. There is also the hint of an erotic relationship, which serves Joseph as an excuse to make reproaches of maternal neglect.
As Tobler's bankruptcy grows ever more inevitable, his clerk takes on more and more of the characteristics of a household servant, receiving from his insolvent and dishonest master a weekly allowance instead of a proper salary.
After a half year in Tobler's service, Marti resigns. He leaves the ruined Villa zum Abendstern on New Year's morning, taking with him the repressed emotions of Mrs Tobler's farewell. And with that the assistant is thrown back upon his uncertain, dislocated existence, longing for a sense of belonging and a connection to his own kind."

Rynn is uncomfortable with his visit, and we can sense right away that his intentions are predatory. They have an uncomfortable verbal sparring match; Hallet attempts frighten Rynn, and then invites himself into her house. It is Halloween, and he has arrived ahead of his own children, who are out trick-or-treating. Rynn has no Halloween candy to offer, so she cuts them each a piece of birthday cake.

Mrs. Hallet says she wants to collect a case of empty jars that are in Rynn's basement; Rynn refuses to allow her to go into the basement and tells her to come back later for the jars.After this confrontation, Rynn goes to the town and looks up public records at the library, and she discovers that Mrs. Hallet was lying about her connections to the school board.

The car won't start, and it attracts the attention of Mario (Scott Jacoby), a boy who is passing by on a bicycle. Mario is around Rynn's age, and he is on his way to a birthday party where he is to perform magic tricks. Mario is a gentle young man who walks with a cane due to an instance of polio in his childhood. Mario promises to help Rynn later, and he returns later to help her hide the car. Rynn makes him dinner, and when his uncle drops by to check on Rynn, Mario tells him Rynn's father was there but has gone to bed. Rynn is grateful that Mario has helped her keep the illusion going, although she doesn't open up to Mario right away about the reasons for her deceitfulness.Frank Hallet also shows up that night and interrupts their dinner; he is looking for his missing mother. Rynn refuses to discuss it with him, even though he kills her hamster by burning it to death with a cigarette. He also humiliates Mario, until Mario suddenly turns on him by revealing a knife hidden inside his cane. Frank runs off, but it is clear he will return.Rynn then tells Mario her secrets. She allows him to go into the cellar and he sees the corpses of both Mrs. Hallet and Rynn's mother. Rynn explains that her father was terminally ill, and that he was concerned about Rynn's estranged mother showing up to collect her if it became known that he was dead. Rynn and her father conspired to make sure that his death would be as inconspicuous as possible; Rynn's rent is paid for the next three years, and her funds are secured in a safety deposit box in the local bank. Almost every aspect of her existence is accounted for, and the only variable was her mother. Rynn's father gave Rynn a vial of white powder and told her to put it into her mother's tea if she ever showed up looking for her. It was cyanide, and Rynn began to suspect this even before her mother collapsed and died. Afterwards she hid her mother's body in the basement.Mario seems to understand and accept Rynn's situation, and he becomes her co-conspirator. He helps Rynn to bury the bodies outside the house, but catches a serious cold in the process. Later Rynn is visited by Miglioriti again, and he is on the verge of exposing Rynn's lies about her father. Suddenly Rynn's father appears and talks to Miglioriti, who is now embarassed that he ever doubted the man's existence. Miglioriti doesn't know that he is actually talking to Mario, who is wearing a disguise including a rubber mask. Miglioriti leaves, satisfied that Rynn's father will take care of any further problems.Mario's condition worsens, and he is hospitalized for pneumonia. Rynn visits him but he is sleeping and cannot hear her. She now understands that even though she has tried to be entirely self-sufficient, she has come to depend on Mario.When Rynn returns home, she is confronted by Frank Hallet, who has emerged from her own basement, giving her quite a shock. Hallet still suspects that Rynn is responsible for the disappearance of his mother because he has found one of his mother's hairpins, and half of a bright red fingernail in the cellar. Frank seems to not really mind that his mother is gone, and he implies that he will use this information to blackmail Rynn into a sexual relationship with him.Rynn now knows what she must do. She offers to fix them some tea, and she puts cyanide into one of the cups. Before they drink, Frank becomes suspicious and makes Rynn drink the cup that was meant for him. Rynn, however, is too smart for that: she herself had taken the poisoned cup, knowing that Frank would switch them. Frank drinks the tea and Rynn watches as the cyanide kills him."
tt0074811,"['Drama', 'Thriller']","Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski), a quiet and unassuming Polish immigrant living in France, rents an apartment in Paris whose previous tenant, Egyptologist Simone Choule, attempted to commit suicide by throwing herself out the third-floor window and through a pane of glass below. He visits Choule in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Choule's bedside, Trelkovsky meets Simone's friend, Stella (Isabelle Adjani), who has also come to visit. Stella begins talking to Simone, who becomes aware of her visitors. Initially showing some signs of agitation upon seeing them, Choule soon lets out a disturbing cry, then suddenly dies. It isn't clear which of the two has caused this reaction. Apparently unaware that Choule is now dead, Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone, instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie (Bruce Lee's Enter The Dragon), where they fondle each other. Outside the theatre they part ways.As Trelkovsky occupies the apartment he is chastised unreasonably by his neighbors and landlord, Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas), for hosting a party with his friends from the clerical office where he works, apparently having a woman over, making too much noise in general, and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor. Trelkovsky attempts to adapt to his situation, but is increasingly disturbed by the apartment and its tenants. He frequently sees his neighbors standing motionless in the toilet room (which he can see from his own window), and discovers a hole in the wall with a human tooth stashed inside. He receives a visit and a letter from one Georges Badar (Rufus), who secretly loves Simone and has believed her to be alive and well. Trelkovsky updates and comforts the man and spends the night out with him drinking at various bars around the city. Gradually he changes his breakfast habits like Simone and shifts from Gauloises to Marlboro cigarettes.One evening, Trelkovsky has a run-in with Stella who is with some friends of hers at a local bar where they talk about the late Simone. After a gathering at friend's house, Stella invites Trelkovsky back to her apartment where she tries to seduce him. Trelkovsky is quite drunk and does not respond to her advances. He tells Stella about finding the human tooth in a wall in his apartment. He then tells a story about a man who lost his arm in an accident and wanted it buried. Trelkovsky instead passes out, leaving Stella to instead sleep beside him.The next day, Trelkovsky returns to his apartment where be becomes severely agitated and enraged when he sees that his apartment has been robbed, while his neighbors and the concierge (Shelley Winters) continue to berate him for making too much noise... despite the fact that he appears to tiptoe around the apartment and watches his TV set without sound. He complains about the robbery to Zy, but the landlord is unsympathetic and refuses to allow Trelkovsky to call the police for he wants the building to remain quiet and respectable. Over the next several days, Trelkvosky becomes hostile and paranoid in his day-to-day environment (snapping at his friends, slapping a child in a park) and his mental state progressively deteriorates as he isolates himself from society. One evening, he imagines himself being attacked by a derelict in the hallway of the lobby in his apartment building while imagining it to be one of his neighbors Madame Dioz (Jo Van Fleet). He buys a wig and woman's shoes and goes on to dress up (using Simone's dress which he had found in a cupboard) and sits still in his apartment in the dead of night.He begins to suspect that Zy and neighbors had driven the previous tenant, Simone, to commit suicide by harassing her, and in his increasingly twisted state of mind, believes that they are trying to subtly change him into Simone so that he too will kill himself. He has visions of his neighbors playing football with a human head in the apartment courtyard, and begins to see himself staring out of his own window and finds the toilet covered in hieroglyphs.After a night of drinking at a local bar, Trelkovsky runs off to Stella for comfort and sleeps over at her apartment and confides in her about his fear that his neighbors are trying to kill him, but she calmly tells him that it is all in his mind. The next morning, after Stella has left for work, he concludes that she too is in on his neighbors' conspiracy when a delivery man arrives outside her apartment with a packaged delivery. In his twisted mind, Trelkovsky looks through the peakhole of the front door and sees Zy there. After the delivery man leaves, Trelkvosky proceeds to wreak havoc in her apartment before departing, and steals her hidden supply of money.That evening, Trelkvosky is drinking at a local bar again when he makes the mistake of asking the barman where he can buy a gun. The barman and the manager throw him out of the bar from where the drunk Trelkvosky wanders into the street where he gets hit by a passing car driven by an elderly couple. The old man and woman stop and exit the car to check on him, and he is not wounded too seriously. An doctor appears and gives him a sedative injection due to his odd behavior. As a result, Trelkvosky perceives the elderly couple as landlord Zy and wife after which the couple return him to his apartment.By this point, a deranged Trelkovsky dresses up again as a woman and throws himself out the apartment window in the exact same manner of Simone Choule, before what he believes to be a clapping, cheering audience composed of his neighbors in the courtyard. The suicide attempt, in fact, wakes up his neighbors (whom Trelkovsky sees as humanoid monsters decending upon him). The neighbors arrive at the scene together with the police just in time for the wounded Trelkovsky to crawl up to his apartment and jump one more time.The end of the movie is enigmatic. Trelkovsky is bandaged up at the local hospital in the same fashion as Simone Choule in the very same hospital bed. When Trelkovsky looks up, two visitors come to visit him the next day. It happens to be Stella... and his own self standing before him in the exact same manner when Trelkvosky and Stella visited Simone in the hospital earlier. Trelkovsky then lets out the same disturbing scream that Simone had screamed. There is the possibility that this scene is not a flashback but that Trelkovsky is really Simone Choule and the whole supernatural cycle is about to start all over again."
tt0074812,"['Action', 'SciFi']","An opening title sets the scene:Sometime in the 23rd century... the survivors of war, overpopulation and pollution are living in a great domed city, sealed away from the forgotten world outside. Here, in an ecologically balanced world, mankind lives only for pleasure, freed by the servo-mechanisms which provide everything.There's just one catch: Life must end at thirty unless reborn in the fiery ritual of carousel.To maintain the ecology of the system of domes that makes up the city, both reproduction and death are carefully controlled by a monolithic master computer. Sex is readily available but there are no long-term relationships. You can dial up a sex partner on ""the circuit"" or visit orgy rooms filled with people of both sexes and clouds of aphrodisiac gas. Babies grow in glass boxes; implanted in each infant's left palm is a life clock, a penny-sized crystal that starts out white and changes color as the years go by. People dress to match their crystal: yellow for a child, green at 16, and red a few years later. Your crystal flashes red as you approach ""lastday"" -- your 30th birthday. On lastday, you're expected to report to an arena for Carousel, the ceremony that will, you have always been told, result in your renewal and rebirth. In fact, you stand in a circle with your age-mates, float to the ceiling when the gravity is turned off, get zapped with lasers, and disintegrate in a cloud of sparks. During the spectacle, ominous music is piped in while hundreds of younger folks applaud and shout ""renew!"" to cheer you on.If this doesn't sound good, your alternative is to become a runner. Runners are criminals and are hunted down and terminated by policemen known as sandmen, who wear black. The city dwellers believe that there is no renewal for runners.Logan-5 (Michael York), a sandman, is in the nursery, knocking on the glass that separates him from a pair of infants; he's trying to wake one up. He tells his friend and fellow sandman Francis-7 (Richard Jordan) that the baby is Logan-6, his son. Francis thinks hanging around the nursery is a little odd and teases Logan that he knows who the baby's seed-mother is. ""I'm curious, not sick,"" Logan retorts.Logan and Francis attend a Carousel but have to leave early when they receive a report of a runner. The runner is killed in a fall trying to escape them and Logan removes a silver ankh (&#9765) from the dead man's hand. At home that night, Logan browses the circuit and chooses a woman called Jessica-6 (Jenny Agutter), a green who wears a silver ankh on a choker. She declines to sleep with him, saying she went on the circuit because she was sad about losing a friend in that day's Carousel, but now regrets it; they argue about whether Carousel participants die, whether sandmen are killers, and whether it's wrong to run.The next day, Logan turns in the ankh he took from the runner. The master computer (voice: Lara Lindsay) recognizes the significance of the ankh. It tells Logan that 1056 runners are unaccounted for and are believed to have escaped the city and fled to a place called Sanctuary. Logan is to go under cover, find Sanctuary, and destroy it. To make him a plausible runner, the computer overrides Logan's life clock so that it begins to flash red immediately, though he's 4 years from his lastday. The computer doesn't answer when he asks whether he'll get his 4 years back.Remembering the ankh around Jessica's neck, Logan sends for her and attempts to convince her that he wishes to find Sanctuary. She agrees to help him after he lets a runner go. She leads him through an orgy room to a secret exit where they meet members of the resistance who are very suspicious of Logan, despite his flashing red life clock. They're right to be suspicious; Logan activates his communicator to lead the other sandmen -- who are unaware of Logan's undercover mission -- to the secret exit and the resistance cadre guarding it. Logan was counting on sending Jessica back to the city, but she's starting to fall for him and insists on coming with him to Sanctuary. When the sandmen arrive Logan won't risk Jessica's life; he runs in earnest, taking Jessica with him. Francis is hard on their heels.Using the ankh to unlock a door, Logan and Jessica escape from the city through the water system and find themselves in an icy cave. They have a close call with a homicidal robot named Box (Roscoe Lee Browne), who captures runners and freezes them -- they see a long corridor lined with people he's frozen. He seems to have been designed to capture food from the outside (""fish and plankton and sea greens and protein from the sea!""), but when it stopped coming he adapted and now harvests runners instead. When he tries to harvest Logan and Jessica, Logan fights back and brings down part of the cave, disabling Box. The fugitives find a tunnel that leads to the outside world. They're not sure what the bright thing in the sky is, but they're glad it's warm. Francis still follows at a distance.The Earth has healed since the disaster. In the wilderness outside the city, the runners are disappointed not to find Sanctuary right away and grow tired and thirsty looking for it. But the landscape is healthy, and soon they find a river to swim in. In the water, they notice that their life clock crystals have stopped functioning and turned white again -- the color of a baby's crystal. Jessica and Logan interpret this as indicating they are no longer bound by the rules of the city and its 30-year limit. They fall in love, and Logan abandons his secret mission. But there are no other people, not even other runners.They explore, finding their way to the overgrown ruins of Washington D.C. (shown on screen with award-winning post-apocalyptic special effects). When they discover the Lincoln Memorial, they are confused by Lincoln's appearance; ""That must be what it looks like to grow old,"" Logan says. Searching for signs of life, they find some gravestones marked ""beloved husband"" and ""beloved wife,"" and wonder what the strange words mean. Then in the ruins of the Capitol, they encounter an eccentric white-bearded old man (Peter Ustinov) and his many cats. The old man has no crystal in his hand; he reminisces about being raised by his own mother and father and recites passages from Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats by T.S. Eliot. This is all nonsense to Logan and Jessica, who have never lived in a family or seen a cat.After quizzing the old man about other people and finding he's never seen or heard of any except his own parents, Logan tries to convince Jessica that there is no Sanctuary. There's no evidence that anyone before them made it past Box. She can't accept it.They are discovered by Francis, who refuses to listen to what they have to say. He attacks Logan; after a fight, Logan kills him by bludgeoning him with an American flag. As he dies, Francis looks at Logan's white crystal and says ""Logan, you renewed!""The three of them bury Francis, and the old man gets Jessica to promise that she'll bury him when his time comes. When Logan hears that, he says they can't keep the promise because they have to go back to the city, destroy all the life clocks, and stop the killing. Jessica resists the plan until they hit on the idea of bringing the old man along; he'll convince the city people that life after 30 and life outside the city are possible.They hike back to the city, but are forced to leave the old man waiting outside while they re-enter the domes through the water system. They promise to bring the city-dwellers out to meet him. They fail; not only do the people ignore their news, but sandmen come and arrest them.The city's master computer interrogates Logan using a memory probe and becomes confused and overloaded by the memories it finds (""there is no Sanctuary ... all frozen ... an old man ... all ruined .... no Sanctuary""), which don't conform to the computer's expectations. The computer malfunctions and Logan fights off a group of sandmen to escape with Jessica, doing further damage to the computer in the process. The ensuing chain reaction wreaks havoc on the city. Fleeing the explosions, the inhabitants go outside and gather curiously around the old man, who is delighted to see them."
tt0074851,"['Drama', 'SciFi']","A humanoid space alien (David Bowie) plummets to planet Earth, landing in a lake in New Mexico. He drinks the water from the lake and thinks about his barren planet, where his wife and two children are dying of thirst. Frequent flashbacks by the alien show of his dying planet.Using the name Thomas Jerome Newton, the alien travels to New York City to speak to lawyer Oliver Farnsworth (Buck Henry). Farnsworth is amazed that Newton has nine basic patents. He will be able to earn $300 million within three years, but Newton tells Farnsworth that he needs more money, not explaining why. He enlists Farnsworth's help to build a great corporation, named World Enterprises. Newton explains that with World Enterprises playing fairly, the corporation would make some other corporation obsolete.Nathan Bryce (Rip Torn), a divorced Chicago chemistry professor, spends his free time seducing his young female students. He becomes fascinated with World Color's self-developing film, which can be purchased very inexpensively (free cameras are thrown in). He wonders who the reclusive owner Newton is and begins making inquiries.Using the alias 'Mr. Sussex', Newton travels to New Mexico. He checks into a local hotel where he meets Mary-Lou (Candy Clark) a maid who helps him when he becomes sick from a fast elevator ride. She becomes his constant companion and lover. She brings him a TV set and influences him to drink alcoholic beverages, partially gin. Eventually, Newton watches many television sets at once having become addicted and begins to drink gin incessantly. Still missing his family, he initiates a space program with all the money he has made in order to return to his home planet and to bring water to help his wife and children.Meanwhile, Farnsworth hires Bryce to come to New Mexico and work on the secret project space program that World Enterprises is funding. Bryce sets up his residence in a small cabin on the other side of the lake from Newton and Mary-Lou. He secretly takes X-rays of Newton and discovers that Newton's form is totally alien. Newton, who can see X-rays, confides in Bryce that he really is an alien. He says he has no intention of causing harm to Earthlings and only wants to help his dying world by sending some of Earth's water back to his planet for it to survive.Over the next year or so, the space project is taking too long. All Newton begins to do to drink and watch television. It is revealed that he has watched American TV for years on his home planet, but never guessed that it revealed nothing about the human condition. As he becomes more human, he feels his life and mission is futile.Newton's relationship with Mary-Lou begins to deteriorate when she demands more attention. He strips off his earthling guise, and she is terrified by his alien form. She can't make love to him anymore, although she continues to admit that she does love him. When Farnsworth bribes Mary-Lou to get away from Newton, she turns him down for she doesn't want money, she only wants ""Tommy"" as he is.Capitalist companies pressure Farnsworth to sell World Enterprises, but Farnsworth refuses. A little later, Farnsworth and his gay lover Trevor (Rick RIccardo) are killed when corporate hit-men throw them both from the window of Farnsworth's New York apartment.Newton completes the spaceship and attempts to take it on its maiden voyage amid intense press exposure. However, just before his scheduled take-off, he is seized and detained. The US government, which has apparently been told by Bryce that Newton is an alien, holds him captive in a locked luxury apartment, constructed deep within a hotel. During his stay, they keep him sedated with alcohol (to which he has become addicted) and continuously subject him to rigorous medical tests - notably one involving X-rays which causes the contact lenses he wears as part of his human disguise to permanently affix themselves to his eyes. Within that time, World Enterprises goes bankrupt. Bryce begins to work for Peters (Bernie Casey) the government agent who masterminded Newton's kidnapping.Toward the end of his years of captivity, he is visited again by Mary-Lou, who is now much older and whose looks have been ravaged by alcohol and time. They have mock-violent, playful sex that involves firing a gun with blanks, and afterwards occupy their time drinking and playing table tennis. Mary-Lou declares that she no longer loves him, while he says that he doesn't love her either. She leaves him. Eventually Newton discovers that his ""prison,"" now derelict, is unlocked, and he leaves.Unable to return home to his planet, a broken and alcoholic Newton creates an album recording with alien messages, titled 'The Visitor', which he hopes will be broadcast via radio to his home planet (which his wife and the entire population may have already died from thirst). Bryce, who has since married Mary-Lou, buys a copy of the album and meets Newton at an outside restaurant in town. Newton is still rich and young looking despite the passage of many years. However, Newton has also fallen into depression and alcoholism and the film ends with an inebriated Newton passing out in his cafe chair."
tt0074860,"['Crime', 'Thriller']","Thomas ""Babe"" Levy (Dustin Hoffman) is a history Ph.D. candidate and avid marathon runner researching the same field as his father, who committed suicide after being investigated in the Communist witch hunts of the Joseph McCarthy era. Babe's brother, Henry James Levy (Roy Scheider), known only as ""Doc"", poses as an oil company executive but in fact is a U.S. government agent working for a secret agency headed up by Director Peter Janeway (William Devane). Babe is not aware of his brother's true occupation.Doc is often supposedly out of the country on business for extended periods of time, but comes to New York under the guise of a visit to Babe. The brother of a Nazi war criminal possesses a safety deposit box key, but is killed in a traffic accident (after a road rage altercation with a short tempered middle-aged Jewish American motorist). Doc suspects that the criminal, Dr. Christian Szell (Laurence Olivier) will be arriving to retrieve an extremely valuable diamond collection. Szell later sends a burly assassin named Chen (James Wing Woo) to kill Doc in his Paris hotel room, but Doc fights the hit man and breaks his back.Babe enters into a relationship with a young woman named Elsa Opel (Marthe Keller), who claims to be from Switzerland. One night while out on a date Elsa and Babe are mugged in a park by two men dressed in suits. Some time later, Doc takes the couple to lunch, where he tricks Elsa into revealing that she has been lying to Babe about her background. Though Doc suspects she may have some connection to Szell, he tells Babe only that she is seeking an American husband so that she can become a U.S. citizen.After Szell arrives in America, Doc meets him to tell the former Nazi he is not welcome in the country, and also to warn Szell to stay away from Babe. Szell casually accepts the pronouncement, but then swiftly knifes Doc, wounding him severely. Doc is able to make it back to his brother's apartment, but collapses and dies in Babe's arms without telling him anything. The police interrogate Babe for hours, until government agents led by Peter Janeway arrive. Janeway asks Babe what Doc told him before he died, and informs Babe of his brother's career as a U.S. government agent. Babe insists that his brother did not tell him anything, but Janeway feels that Doc struggled all the way to Babe's apartment to give him vital information of some kind.Babe is later abducted from his apartment by Szell's henchmen, Karl and Erhardt (the two men from the park). In an infamous sequence, Babe is tortured by Szell, a skilled dentist, who repeatedly asks ""Is it safe?"" Confused by the question code phrase he does not understand, Babe denies any knowledge, but is tortured. The dentist offers him oil of cloves, an anesthetic, as positive inducement to cooperate. Eventually, Babe loses consciousness and Szell pauses his torture.Babe is then rescued by Janeway, who apparently kills Szell's bodyguards and takes Babe from Szell's hideout. As he drives, Janeway explains that Szell is in America to sell off his large cache of diamonds, which he had taken from Jews he had exterminated at Auschwitz during World War II. Janeway continually presses Babe about Doc's dying words, but Babe again insists he knows nothing. Frustrated, Janeway reveals himself as a double agent working with the Nazi criminal all along, and he turns Babe over to Karl and Erhardt (Janeway had only faked killing them). As it turns out, Szell is one of Janeway's highest level informants, and had informed on other Nazi war criminals in return for immunity.Delivered back into Szell's hands, the Nazi criminal has a curiously kindly conversation with Babe before calmly explaining why he is holding Babe for questioning. Szell suspected that Doc would attempt to rob him of his diamonds, or rat on him to authorities; thus his desire to know if it's ""safe"" to withdraw the diamonds, i.e., whether Doc told Babe any incriminating information. Still unable to extract anything from Babe, he proceeds to drill into one of Babe's healthy teeth. Babe eventually escapes again, this time on his own, with Janeway and Szell's two henchmen giving chase in a car. Though exhausted and barefoot, he is able to outrun his pursuers in part by remembering famous ""marathon man"" Abebe Bikila, who ran barefoot.After inviting a neighborhood acquaintance and his toughs to break into his apartment and steal his pistol (the same pistol his father used to commit suicide), Babe phones Elsa, who agrees to meet him with a car. She drives him to a country home as a hideout. Babe guesses that she has set him up; she confesses that Szell's dead brother owned the home, and that she was one of Szell's couriers. Janeway and Szell's men arrive, but Babe avoids an ambush by taking Elsa hostage. In another twist, Janeway kills Szell's men and offers to let Babe kill Szell in revenge for Doc's death if Janeway can have the diamonds. Babe agrees, but as he leaves to find Szell, Janeway attempts to shoot Babe, but kills Elsa instead when she tries to alert Babe. Angered, Babe guns down Janeway.Back in New York, Szell attempts to determine the value of his diamonds. However, he chooses an appraiser in the Diamond District in midtown Manhattan, where many of the shop owners are Jewish. A shop assistant who is also an Auschwitz survivor believes he has recognized Szell as a wanted Nazi criminal. After Szell hurriedly leaves the shop, an elderly Jewish woman also recognizes him, but passersby think she is senile. Trying to cross the street to get closer to Szell in order to expose him she is hit by a taxicab, causing a crowd to assemble to assist her. Amidst the confusion, the shop assistant appears again, directly confronting Szell. Becoming increasingly paranoid, Szell slits the man's throat with a retractable blade concealed in his sleeve.Szell retrieves his diamonds from the bank, but is taken hostage by Babe as he attempts to leave, who inconspicuously forces him into Central Park and into one of the pump rooms at the south end of the Reservoir. Babe holds Szell at gunpoint on a scaffold and seizes the diamonds; rather than kill Szell, Babe informs him that he will allow Szell to live and keep as many diamonds as he can swallow. Szell initially refuses, prompting Babe to begin throwing the diamonds into the water below them. Szell relents and swallows one diamond, but then refuses to cooperate further. Szell goes on to insult Babe, and after he spits in Babe's face, a fight erupts in which Szell tries to stab Babe. Babe throws the remainder of the diamonds down the scaffold steps towards the water; Szell dives for them, but stumbles, and fatally falls on his own knife blade. Picking up his gun, Babe exits the pump room and heads out into Central Park. Stopping by the Reservoir, he throws the gun into the water."

While Teresa is grateful to David for saving her, Mary and Jane do not thank him and tell David that he is now a marked man having crossed Craig, Bruce, and Paul.Humiliated by this latest encounter with David, the bullies approach Mark and tell him that he only has one more chance to talk to David to mind his own business. At nightfall, they drive down the Pacific Coast Highway where they find David's car. Venturing down to the beach to find David, Mark sees him with Teresa skinny dipping in the ocean. Filled with anger and jealousy, Mark goes back to the bullies in Paul's van and lies to them by saying that he tried to talk to David, but he wouldn't listen. The three bullies decide to take matters into their own hands.One evening, David is repairing Rodney's car when the bullies appear and kick the jack out and it lands on top of David, in which one of the wheels crushes his left leg. After several weeks in the hospital, David returns to school, now limping from a leg cast under trousers. But worse for David, he can no longer jog which is the one outlet for his anger. Most of the students avoid and snub David for attempting to make a stand against the bullies. Arthur tells David a great big ""I told you so"" about wanting to take on Craig, Bruce, and Paul. Even Mark is mean and nasty towards David for his flirtation with Teresa. When Mark confronts Teresa later and tells her that he saw her and David that night on the beach, she tells him about how David saved her from being raped earlier that day. She also tells Mark that although she really wanted to have sex with David that night on the beach, he refused to make love to her out of loyalty to Mark. Mark feels guilty over it realizing that he inadvertently got back at David for nothing.But David, having turned psychotic from this latest encounter, secretly plots to kill the three bullies in the same manner he believes they tried to kill him: by making it look like an accident. David begins his lethal plan of revenge when he breaks a cable on one hand glider to one of the bullies: Bruce. During the bullies Saturday hand gliding excursion, Bruce loses control of his hand glider when the cord for the steering breaks, and it rams into power lines, electrocuting him.Craig is the next victim when David intercepts a letter from the janitor to Craig about the school swimming pool being cleaned. That evening, Craig, a championship swimmer in training for the next Olympics, arrives at the school for his private practice sessions when David turns out the lights to the pool area. He tricks Craig into diving into the empty swimming pool.Paul is the final victim when David attacks him the following day in his van and rolls it down a cliff where it hits the rocks and explodes, killing Paul instantly. Mark arrives on the scene and discovers that David is responsible for Paul's death as well as Craig's and Bruce's as well. David challenges Mark to stop him, but Mark loves David too much to fight him. David, however, despite knowing that Mark knows the truth, agrees to let him live out of his love for Teresa.For a time, everyone at the school is grateful to David and is on friendly terms now that the three bullies are gone from their lives. But soon, they all tries to enlist the help of their hero and savior David so they can obtain power. From Arthur taking charge of the geeks, Oscar with the fat guys, to Rodney with the jocks, and Spoony with the punks, they take on one another for power. Soon, fights and arguments break out all over the school as Oscar, Arthur, Rodney, and Spoony quarrel with one another over territory rights. David, disgusted at the fighting and that the oppressed have become the new oppressors, plots to get rid of all the students.A few days later, David commences ""the massacre at central high"". Arthur is killed when David switches his hearing aid with another one that produces high decibel sonic pulses, which blow Arthurs eardrums out. Oscar is next when he opens his locker and a pipe bomb that David had placed earlier, explodes, killing him and several of his fat boy members. The students panic as more pipe bombs go off, killing and wounded many students. Rodney attempts to flee from the chaos in the parking lot by getting into his car and upon starting it, it explodes, killing him and a number of other jocks and other students with him. Only Spoony manages to escape and hides out in the wilderness with his two girlfriends, Mary and Jane. But David follows them and kills them as well by blowing up a face of a cliff and crushing the three of them in their tent under an avalanche of rocks.Mark, aware that David is behind all the carnage, tells Teresa that they must try to stop David before he kills more people for he has clearly been driven to the edge by everything that has happened. Mark gets a gun and with Teresa they go after David. They arrive at David's house and confront him in his workshop where he is constructing more pipe bombs. David challenges Mark to shoot him and put and end to his killing spree that he is now addicted to since he cannot jog anymore. But Mark can't do it. David then subdues Mark and locks him and Teresa in his workshop and goes to the school, where a student-alumni dance is taking place. David hides a large bomb in the basement of the school and plots to blow up the dance with all the remaining students and teachers inside the gym.Mark and Teresa manage to break out of David's workshop room and head over to the school. Realizing that the only way to stop David is by playing on his last sympathies he has towards them, they enter the gym where they party is being held and begin to dance. David sees them and tries to get them to leave the building before the bomb goes off. The refuse and dance, saying that if David really wants to kill everyone in the school, he will have to kill them too. Realizing that they will not leave and that both Mark and Teresa are sorrowfully willing to sacrifice their lives for him, David rushes (not very fast because of his limp) to the basement and retrieves the bomb. He takes it outside where it explodes killing him, and blasting out all the windows in the school and gym. Mark and Teresa agree to tell the police that the missing Spoony had planted the bomb and that David had given his life to save everyone."
tt0074896,"['Biography', 'Drama', 'History', 'War']","Handsomely-mounted historical epic concerns the birth of the
Islamic faith and the story of the prophet Mohammed -- who, in
accordance with the tenants of Islam, is never to be depicted (as this is against certain Islamic schools of thought). In Mecca in the 7th century, Mohammed is visited by a
vision of the Angel Gabriel, who urges him to lead the people of
Mecca to cast aside the 300 idols of Kaaba and instead worship the
one true God, speaking out against the corrupt political and military
leaders who rule Mecca. With the help of his uncle, a brave warrior
named Hamza (Anthony Quinn), Mohammed and his followers return
to Mecca to liberate the city in the name of God. The Message
(originally screened in the U.S. as Mohammed, Messenger of God)
proved to be highly controversial during its production and initial
release. Unfounded rumors had it that Mohammed would not only be
depicted in the film, but that he was to be played by Charlton Heston
or Peter O'Toole. This resulted in protests by some Muslim, until director Moustapha Akkad hired a staff of respected Islamic clerics as technical advisors. The Message was shot in two
versions, one in English and one in Arabic (entitled Al-Ris-Alah), with
different actors taking over some of the roles due to language
requirements."
tt0074899,"['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'War']","Six months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. Navy still has not fully recovered from the losses it suffered. In April of 1942 the US staged a desperate stopgap measure to bring pressure on Japan by launching Army bombers under the command of James Doolittle from the USS Hornet to bomb Tokyo and other cities. While the raid achieved relatively little in terms of damage, it has sent a wave of panic among Japanese leadership, and the commander of the Combined Fleet, Isoroku Yamamoto, sees it as opportunity to implement a planned attack on the island of Midway, near the Hawaiian Islands, a plan designed to bring out what is left of the US Pacific Fleet and finish it off before American industry (which has long scared Yamamoto given its greater strength over Japan's) can fully commit to rebuilding American strength. The proposed operation encounters resistance from Admiral Nobutake Kondo, who doesn't believe Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo can survive another attack by the First Air Fleet's carriers against a target certain to bring out land-based bombers.While the command corps of the Imperial Navy debates Yamamoto's plan, US Navy Captain Matthew Garth, a go-between for the Navy's Pacific command - aka CINCPAC - is consulting Navy intelligence chief Captain Joseph Rochefort, who spends his full time in a dank underground chamber decoding Japanese radio traffic with a staff of assistants. Rochefort has been getting some traffic about an area of interest to the Japanese known only as Objective AF.Garth, meanwhile, has a more personal issue to deal with, as his son, a Navy pilot, has fallen in love with a Japanese girl on Oahu, at the worst possible time given the wholesale internment of Japanese on American soil.Rochefort's codebreaking allows the Pacific Fleet to learn of a Japanese invasion force heading for Port Moresby. Two of the Fleet's four available carrier groups - the USS Lexington and Yorktown - are dispatched to the Coral Sea, where they engage two of the First Air Fleet's carriers, Division Five, the Shokaku and Zuikaku, and a smaller carrier. The Lexington is attacked by some two hundred Japanese planes and sunk, while the smaller Japanese carrier is sunk and some damage is wrought to the rest of Division Five. The Yorktown is also heavily damaged and some 100 US aircraft are lost.After the Yorktown returns to Pearl for repairs - a three-month job compressed to three days via 1,200 technicians working around the clock - Captain Garth and Joe Rochefort meet Admiral Chester Nimitz with after-action reports from Coral Sea. It is here that Rochefort broaches a theory that Objective AF in Japanese code traffic may be the Island of Midway, near Hawaii; Rochefort asks that a dummy message about a shortage of fresh water be sent from Midway in the clear. Deciding no harm can come of it, Nimitz has his aide LTC Earnest Blake have the message sent.Days later a transmission from the Japanese warbase on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands is intercepted by Pearl and it confirms that AF is indeed Midway. Garth awakens Nimitz with the news.Meanwhile Yamamoto has laid out his plan - a Northern force is to invade several Aleutian Islands to draw US attention from Midway, where the First Air Fleet - now down to four carriers, the Akagi, Kaga, Soru, and Hiryu - will attack Midway; Admiral Kondo's invasion fleet will then occupy the island and the US will have no choice but to counterattack with their remaining carriers, under the presumed command of aggressive Admiral William F. Halsey. There is no concern for the understrength nature of the First Air Fleet given that Division Five was considered the weakest unit of the Imperial Navy's carrier force. Admiral Nagumo, though, does have some misgivings that the plan depends on the US reacting as expected.Nimitz meanwhile gets bad news - Halsey has been hospitalized and will not be available to defend Midway, so he hands command to one of his cruiser commanders, Raymond Spruance. Atop this, Nimitz has to deal with Vinton Maddox, a ""scalp-hunter"" from Washington who believes the Japanese are feeding radio traffic to deceive Hawaii into being outmaneuvered by a Japanese strike at Hawaii itself or even California.Captain Garth is assigned to the USS Yorktown, now operational despite Coral Sea damage, under Admiral Frank J. Fletcher, while Admiral Spruance commands the carriers Enterprise and Hornet. Also assigned to the Enterprise's air group is Matt's son, Tom, angry that his father tried to intervene on behalf of his girlfriend.In early June long range reconnaisance seaplanes spot the two Japanese armadas, and as expected Nagumo's air fleet attacks Midway, slaughtering the island's small group of fighters and strafing and bombing the area. Nagumo, though, has ordered scout planes to probe the area he expects American sea forces to be - northeast of Midway, as they indeed are. But a scout plane is late getting launched, a fateful delay when the Midway attack commences and returning aircraft arrive to the fleet almost out of fuel and some sustaining damage - just as the tardy scout plane picks up the US fleet and Nagumo's assistant Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi recommends an immediate attack on the US force even with aircraft not properly armed for anti-ship action.The Midway attack has brought out the air armadas of the three US carriers, but attack by torpedo planes is intercepted by Japanese fighters; Group Eight from the USS Hornet is massacred and only Ensign George Gay survives, while Group's Six and Three achieve no success either; Tom Garth and other fighter pilots do succeed in shooting down several enemy fighters but Tom's plane is pierced by fire and the cockpit blows up in flame, severely injuring Tom.Amid the martyrdom of the Torpedo Groups, Raymond Massey and Max Leslie of the Enterprise and Yorktown's dive bomber squadrons reach the enemy force just as Nagumo has begun to launch his planned attack on the US fleet; caught completely by surprise, the Japanese carriers are pummeled by dive bombers and their flight decks, stacked with launching aircraft and bombs carelessly stacked aside, are ripped to shreds. Within a minute or so, the Akagi, Kaga, and Soryu are shredded and left in flame, with only Tamon Yamaguchi and the Hiryu left to attack the USS Yorktown."
tt0074906,"['Drama', 'Western']","The action takes place in Montana in the 1880s among the tributary streams that eventually flow together into the Missouri River, an area known as the Missouri Breaks. Tom Logan, (Jack Nicholson) is the likable leader of an amiable gang of horse thieves. They make their living stealing horses or rustling cattle from ranchers, laughing all the way, spending their money on whiskey and whores.Logan and his gang are particularly upset by the hanging of a friend by rancher David Braxton (John McLiam), an egomaniacal gay local land baron who took the law into his own hands. Braxton has horses, and a daughter, worth stealing.Logan's men pull off a daring train robbery, only to lose much of the money. The gang retaliates against Braxton by hanging his foreman Pete Marker (Richard Bradford) on the same noose.Posing as an aspiring cattle rancher, Logan buys an abandoned ranch next to Braxton's to serve as a relay station for moving stolen horses across the plains.While his men ride off across the Missouri River and north of the border to steal Canadian Mounted Police horses, Logan plants crops at their new farm and enters into a relationship with Braxton's virginal daughter, Jane (Kathleen Lloyd). He knows how to court a woman by brewing Chinese tea in the Wild West. Jane is on bad terms with her father and has taken a shine to Logan in any event,
seems to be fascinated by the bad guys and demands sex, saying: ""Do you want to have sexual intercourse?"" while flirting with Logan. Braxton, obsessed with his rustling problem, his daughter, and avenging his friend's murder, sends for Robert E. Lee Clayton (Marlon Brando), a notorious regulator from Medicine Hat, Wyoming, who, for a price, will take care of rustlers personally, one at a time. Regulators were mercenary frontier agents famous for their ruthlessness and their ability to kill without warning from long distances with their trademark Creekmore rifles.
Clayton arrives with a fancy wardrobe, a perfumed scent, an Irish brogue and a rifle with which he is deadly accurate from afar. Clayton bursts in on the funeral of the murdered foreman dressed like a western dandy in fringed leather coat and scarf, bellowing and yanking the corpse up out of the open casket to borrow a few of the ice cubes used to keep the body from decomposing as a compress for a tooth-ache.Clayton is portrayed comically, but he is a sadistic, perverse, and psychotic killer who comes across as much more lawless than the criminals he's hunting.Quickly suspicious of Logan, who doesn't strike him as much of a farmer, Clayton dons a variety of disguises to pick off Logan's gang, one by one.Impersonating a preacher ""Jim Ferguson,"" Clayton tries to cajole Little Todd into confessing that he is part of the gang. He kills Todd by dragging him with a rope through the raging Missouri, seemingly aware of the fact that Todd cannot swim.Clayton spies on Logan with binoculars and taunts Braxton about his daughter's affair with a horse thief. Braxton attempts to discharge him but Clayton is determined to finish what he starts.He amuses himself by shooting two more of Logan's partners from a distance and then by wearing a granny dress while brutally killing Logan's closest friend, Cal (Harry Dean Stanton) with a handmade weapon.Logan knows it's kill or be killed by Clayton. He also wants vengeance against Braxton for having hired the regulator in the first place, despite his feelings for Jane. Now it's up to Logan to hunt down Clayton. One night after a campfire goes dark with Clayton serenading his horse, Logan gets his revenge catching up with him while he's asleep and then slitting his throat: ""You know what woke you up? You just had your throat cut!"" Logan then comes after Braxton. There's a shootout where Braxton, who everyone now believes is infirm with a stroke, pulls out a gun while he's sitting in a wheelchair and shoots the unawares Logan. Logan then shoots back killing Braxton.Logan abandons his farm and packs up to leave the area and Jane, although he acknowledges that he and Jane might renew their relationship another time, another place."

The invitation reads, ""You are cordially invited to Dinner and a Murder at 22 Lola Lane, Saturday evening 7 P.M.""On Saturday night, the Charlestons are lost in a fog. Dick tries to call his host, but Twain's telephone line has been cut by an unseen culprit.
Sidney Wang and his adopted Japanese son, Willie (Richard Narita), stop to read a map and encounter Dick.In another car, Tess Skeffington (Eileen Brennan) recites Twain's dossier to her employer/paramour, Sam Diamond. The car runs out of gas and Tess is required to hike five miles to the nearest station.In another car, Milo and his personal chauffeur Marcel Cassette (James Cromwell) are trying to find the address and also are having trouble driving through the fog.When Sidney and Willie arrive at Twain's door, they barely miss being struck by a falling gargoyle. They are greeted by Jamessir Bensonmum (Alec Guinness), the blind butler, who takes them to their room, where ""a cozy fire"" is consuming the bed. The Charlestons arrive next, sipping martinis to ease the shock of their close call with a falling gargoyle. Bensonmum leads them to their room, which is covered in dust and cobwebs. In the kitchen, Bensonmum informs Yetta (Nancy Walker), the kitchen maid, of her duties. His effort is wasted, as she is deaf and mute, but he cannot see the note explaining her condition.Bensonmum returns to the living room to find Milo, who complains that Marcel has received a minor injury from a falling gargoyle. Sam is less passive about his gargoyle encounter and threatens Bensonmum at gunpoint. The guests gather in the drawing room for cocktails and deduce that the world's greatest detectives have been brought together for a reason. Sam and Tess enter, followed soon after by Jessica Marbles and her wheelchair-bound nurse, Miss Withers (Estelle Winwood). The group is summoned to the dining room. Bensonmum serves soup from an empty tureen. He apologizes and goes to the kitchen to fire Yetta, still unaware of the futility.After narrowly escaping death from poisoned wine and falling swords, the guests meet their host, whose entrance is accompanied by flashing colored lights. Twain announces that he will prove himself to be the world's greatest criminologist. A murder is to be committed at midnight, and both the killer and the victim are currently at the table. Twain wagers $1 million against their reputations that none of the five detectives will be able to solve the crime. With the push of a button, he seals them inside the house, and then makes a dramatic exit. Yetta storms into the dining room and ""screams,"" although she produces no sound. Sidney, Jessica and Milo go to the kitchen, where they discover the body of Bensonmum, and notice a butcher knife missing from the knife rack. Locked out of the dining room, Milo retrieves the key from Bensonmum, but the body has disappeared and only the butler's clothes remain. They find the dining room deserted, but Twain, watching from the moose head on the wall, assures the detectives that no one has left the dining room and instructs them to leave the room and re-enter. They follow Twain's instructions and find all the guests in place. The sound of gunshots emanates from the kitchen, prompting Dick and Sam to investigate. Bensonmum's body has reappeared, but without clothing.While Dick uses the bathroom, Sam returns to the dining room, which is again deserted. When he opens the bathroom door, Sam sees a cobweb-covered bed occupied by the Charlestons' terrier. Dick reappears when Sam closes the door and reopens it. Sam enters the dining room and tells the other guests of his experience, which leads them to deduce that Twain has ""two of everything"" in the house. Milo leaves the room to demonstrate by knocking three times. Dick returns, followed moments later by Milo, who has been squeezed into Bensonmum's suit.As the clock is about to strike midnight, Dora notices that Yetta has disappeared and there is a knock on the door. Twain stands in the doorway and falls forward, revealing a butcher knife and multiple stab wounds in his back. Dora concludes that Yetta is the culprit, but Sam discovers a case containing Yetta's components, proving the maid to be an automaton robot. Dora then asserts that one of the guests must be the murderer.The guests assemble in the drawing room, where they posit their theories. Dick believes the murder was an elaborate suicide. Sidney suspects Dick, explaining that the Charlestons are destitute and have been borrowing money from Twain at seventeen percent interest. Dick draws attention to Jessica, explaining that Twain, her former fiancee, left her at the altar. Milo suggests patricide, and Tess admits that Twain was her uncle, but he was also Sidney's adoptive father. When Twain realized, after 19 years, that his son was Asian, Sidney was forced to leave home. Wang counters by reminding Milo of Marie Louise Cartier, Milo's poodle, which Twain hunted and killed. Tess divulges that Sam also hated Twain because he had photographs of Sam wearing women's clothing from the night they met in a gay bar, although Sam argues that he was undercover.When they retire to their bedrooms, the Wangs are threatened by a deadly snake. At the same time, the Charlestons are frozen in fear as a scorpion crawls toward them. In their bedroom, Jessica and Miss Withers smell poison gas. In their room, Sam and Tess receive notice of a hidden time bomb ticking down. As the bomb is heard exploding, Milo and Marcel are trapped in their room and are about to be crushed by a descending ceiling.In the drawing room, the very much alive and not-blind Bensonmum crosses the detectives' names off of a list. However, each of the guests appears in the room having miraculously cheated death for various reasons, and offers his or her solution in hopes of winning the $1 million wager. Sidney relies on the old adage, ""the butler did it,"" while Jessica knows Bensonmum to actually be Irving Goldman, Twain's attorney. Dick suggests that Bensonmum is an accountant named Marvin Metzner, but Milo believes him to be Twain's daughter, Rita, whose hatefulness stems from her manly appearance. Sam announces that he and Tess are actors, and Bensonmum is the real Sam Diamond, who created this ruse to prove his superiority to his colleagues.After humoring each of them, the butler removes his mask and reveals himself to be the very much alive Twain himself. He berates the detectives for exploiting their readers with nonsensical surprise endings and other unscrupulous devices. Their reputations will be ruined when the world learns that Twain outsmarted them.As the guests leave, without the $1 million, Sam admits to Tess that he really is Sam Diamond, while Dick explains to his wife that everything they've experienced was fake, including the fog. When Willie asks Wang if there had really been a murder or not, Wang replies: ""Yes. Killed a good weekend!""Alone in his home, Twain pulls off yet another mask to reveal the mute Yetta, who lights up a cigarette and laughs diabolically while rings of cigarette smoke fill the screen.End credits."
tt0074958,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'R']","The following synopsis has mostly been taken from the film's wikipedia page:Howard Beale (Peter Finch), the longtime anchor of the Union Broadcasting System's UBS Evening News, learns from the news division president, Max Schumacher (William Holden), that he has just two more weeks on the air because of declining ratings. The two old friends get roaring drunk and lament the state of their industry. The following night, Beale announces on live television that he will commit suicide on next Tuesday's broadcast. UBS fires him after this incident, but Schumacher intervenes so that Beale can have a dignified farewell. Beale promises he will apologise for his outburst, but once on the air, he launches back into a rant claiming that life is ""bullshit"". Beale's outburst causes the newscast's ratings to spike, and much to Schumacher's dismay, the upper echelons of UBS decide to exploit Beale's antics rather than pull him off the air. In one impassioned diatribe, Beale galvanises the nation, persuading his viewers to shout out of their windows ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!""Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) heads the network's programming department; seeking just one hit show, she cuts a deal with a band of radical terrorists (a parody of the Symbionese Liberation Army called the ""Ecumenical Liberation Army"") for a new docudrama series called the Mao Tse-Tung Hour for the upcoming fall season. When Beale's ratings seem to have topped out, Christensen approaches Schumacher and offers to help him ""develop"" the news show. He says no to the professional offer, but not to the personal one, and the two begin an affair. When Schumacher decides to end the Howard as the ""Angry Man"" format, Christensen convinces her boss, Frank Hackett, to slot the evening news show under the entertainment division so she can develop it. Hackett agrees, bullies the UBS executives to consent, and fires Schumacher at the same time. Soon afterward, Beale is hosting a new program called The Howard Beale Show, top-billed as ""the mad prophet of the airwaves"". Ultimately, the show becomes the most highly rated program on television, and Beale finds new celebrity preaching his angry message in front of a live studio audience that, on cue, chants Beale's signature catchphrase en masse: ""We're as mad as hell, and we're not going to take this anymore."" At first, Max and Diana's romance withers as the show flourishes, but in the flush of high ratings, the two ultimately find their way back together, and Schumacher leaves his wife of over 25 years for Christensen. But Christensen's fanatical devotion to her job and emotional emptiness ultimately drive Max back to his wife, and he warns his former lover that she will self-destruct at the pace she is running with her career. ""You are television incarnate, Diana,"" he tells her, ""indifferent to suffering, insensitive to joy. All of life is reduced to the common rubble of banality.""When Beale discovers that Communications Corporation of America (CCA), the conglomerate that owns UBS, will be bought out by an even larger Saudi Arabian conglomerate, he launches an on-screen tirade against the deal, encouraging viewers to send telegrams to the White House telling them, ""I want the CCA deal stopped now!"" This throws the top network brass into a state of panic because the company's debt load has made merger essential for survival. Hackett takes Beale to meet with CCA chairman Arthur Jensen, who explicates his own ""corporate cosmology"" to the attentive Beale. Jensen delivers a tirade of his own in an ""appropriate setting"", the dramatically darkened CCA boardroom, that suggests to the docile Beale that Jensen may himself be some higher power describing the interrelatedness of the participants in the international economy and the illusory nature of nationality distinctions. Jensen persuades Beale to abandon the populist messages and preach his new ""evangel"". But television audiences find his new sermons on the dehumanisation of society depressing, and ratings begin to slide, yet Jensen will not allow UBS executives to fire Beale. Seeing its two-for-the-price-of-one value, solving the Beale problem plus sparking a boost in season-opener ratings. Christensen, Hackett, and the other executives decide to hire the Ecumenical Liberation Army to assassinate Beale on the air. The assassination succeeds, putting an end to The Howard Beale Show and kicking off a second season of The Mao Tse-Tung Hour.The film ends with the narrator stating:""This was the story of Howard Beale, the first known instance of a man who was killed because he had lousy ratings."""

The police strongly recommend that he provide the kidnappers with shredded blank paper instead of the demanded ransom, and he agrees to the plan. This leads to a bungled car chase in which both kidnappers and victims are killed in a spectacular explosion. Courtland blames himself for the deaths of his wife and daughter.15 Years later. Courtland is morbidly obsessed with his dead wife, and regularly visits a monument he has had built in her memory. The monument is a replica of the church (Basilica di San Miniato al Monte) where he and Elizabeth had met many years before in Florence, Italy. His real estate partner Robert LaSalle (John Lithgow) convinces Courtland to tag along on a business trip back to Florence. While there, Courtland revisits the church, and suddenly comes face to face with a young woman named Sandra (Bujold again in a dual role) who looks exactly like his late wife. The already slightly unhinged Courtland begins to court the young woman, and subtly attempts to transform her into a perfect mirror image of his dead wife.Courtland returns to New Orleans with Sandra so they can marry. On their wedding night, Sandra is kidnapped and a ransom note is left behind by her abductors. It is an exact replica of the kidnappers' message from fifteen years before. This time, Courtland decides to deliver the demanded cash. He withdraws massive quantities of money from his accounts and business holdings, financially ruining him and forcing him to sign over his interest in the real estate business to LaSalle. In the process, he discovers that his entire ordeal, including the original kidnapping, had been engineered by LaSalle as a way to gain sole control of Courtland's company share holdings. The now nearly insane Courtland stabs LaSalle to death.Knowing that Sandra must have been a willing accomplice in the plot against him, he goes to the airport to kill the escaping woman. On the plane, Sandra has a flashback to her part in the scheme; she is in fact Courtland's daughter, allowed by LaSalle to survive the explosive traffic ""accident"" from years before that had killed her mother. LaSalle had told her lies about Courtland over the years, convincing her that her father had not paid the ransom because he didn't love her. Sandra, who now loves Courtland, attempts suicide on the plane and is taken off the flight in a wheelchair. Courtland sees her and runs toward her, gun drawn. A security guard attempts to stop him but Courtland smashes the briefcase full of money against the guard's head, knocking him unconscious. The briefcase breaks open and all of the money flies out. Sandra, seeing the fluttering bills, stands up and shouts: ""Daddy! You brought the money!"" Courtland now realizes for the first time who Sandra really is, and father and daughter fall into a deep embrace."
tt0074995,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'PG']","Set during the spring and summer of 1953 in rural Mississippi, Billy Joe McAllister (Robby Benson) flirts with Bobbie Lee Hartley (Glynnis O'Connor) as she crosses the Tallahatchie Bridge after the school bus lets her off as she walks on her way to her family's farm along a dirt road. Bobbie Lee reminds him that her father, Glenn (Sandy McPeak), still thinks of her as a child, even though she is 15-years-old and has been wearing a brassiere for two years. A friend since childhood, Billy Joe teases her about ""Benjamin,"" the imaginary friend in whom Bobbie Lee has always confided, and offers himself as a replacement. Bobbie Lee says nothing but is delighted by Billy Joe's attention.That evening, Brother Taylor (Simpson Hemphill), the local Baptist preacher, has dinner with the Hartleys, and Bobbie Lee is asked by her parents to play a hymn on the piano. Later, Billy Joe is at a saloon with some co-workers from the local sawmill where exotic dancer Belinda Wiggs (Frannye Capelle) is giving a performance, but he becomes uncomfortable and leaves. Meanwhile, Bobbie Lee is in her bedroom reading aloud from 'Torrid Romance'.The next morning, Bobbie Lee and her mother, Anna (Joan Hotchkis), pack eggs for market while Glenn loads cans of milk onto his pickup truck. Anna empathizes with her daughter's sexual curiosity and, although she knows her advice is inadequate, reminds Bobbie Lee that ""when the sap rises, a girl has to count to ten."" While driving their wares to market, Glenn and Bobbie Lee are trapped on the bridge by a pickup truck containing three drunken hick boys from Alabama. Glenn's inability to pass or shift into reverse results in a shoving match between the two trucks, which leaves Glenn's vehicle balanced precariously on the edge of the bridge. Bobbie Lee runs to Dewey Barksdale's (James Best) sawmill to get help from James (Terence Goodman), her older brother, who works there. As she returns to the bridge with James and sawmill workers Tom Hargitay (Eddie Talr) and Billy Joe, they are hindered by the Alabama boys, who veer continuously across the narrow road. Glenn is rescued, but his truck is badly damaged, which infuriates James.On Sunday morning, outside the local church, congregants compliment Brother Taylor on his sermon denouncing premarital sex, while Billy Joe tells Bobbie Lee of his intention to call on her that evening. She warns him of her father's strictness, but Billy Joe is undaunted. Toward evening, Bobbie Lee complains to Glenn about the family's need for electricity and indoor plumbing, before introducing the subject of ""gentleman callers."" When he asks her age, she answers, ""32B,"" referring to her bra size. Glenn promises to allow callers in two years, when she is ""34"". Bobbie Lee is exasperated and goes outside for a walk. While complaining aloud about the backward ways of her community, Bobbie Lee encounters Billy Joe. They walk to the side of a pond where they share their first kiss, before falling in.At the sawmill the next day, the teasing that Billy Joe endures from James and Tom reinforces his desire to move to another town. Meanwhile, a mother-daughter discussion of womanhood is interrupted when Glenn surprises his family with a new toilet for the house. The following afternoon, Billy Joe forces his way onto the school bus and makes public his intentions toward Bobbie Lee. She pretends to be embarrassed, but after they get off the bus, Bobbie Lee hints that her father may become more open-minded once the toilet is installed.That Saturday night, Barksdale's sawmill hosts a musical event called the Okolona River Bottom Jamboree. While people dance inside, a group of prostitutes create a makeshift brothel in an adjacent structure. After getting Billy Joe intoxicated on beer, Tom brings him to the brothel. In the parking lot, James discovers the truck belonging to the Alabama boys, and a brawl ensues, resulting in a broken jaw for one of the boys.On Tuesday morning, Trooper Ned (John Roper) and Trooper Bosh (Will Long) appear at the sawmill, along with Billy Joe's father, Dan McAllister (William Hallberg), who is looking for his missing son. Later that afternoon, Bobbie Lee finds Billy Joe by the pond. He has been hiding in the woods for the last three days, ashamed of a sin he committed at the Jamboree. When they both admit to loving each other, he asks her to meet him on the bridge at dusk to consummate their relationship.After dinner, Bobbie Lee finds the rag doll she named ""Benjamin"" and brings it with her to the bridge. When she arrives, Brother Taylor is fishing nearby, and Billy Joe, who is extremely tense, accidentally drops Benjamin into the river; this is witnessed by Brother Taylor. Once the preacher has left, they head to a wooded area, but Billy Joe is unable to perform. He bursts into tears and admits to having intercourse with a man, and must therefore be a homosexual. Bobbie Lee refuses to believe it and wants to resume their lovemaking, but he declines and sends her home. She tries to encourage him with the news that her father will allow gentleman callers. Billy Joe promises that he will do better next time.The next morning, the sheriff and his troopers pull Billy Joe's body from the river. At the funeral service, Brother Taylor professes that at least one among the congregation knows the reason for Billy Joe's suicide. Sometime later, while Bobbie Lee collects eggs in the chicken coup, James informs her that the McAllisters sold their house and have moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi. James falsely believes that his sister is pregnant by Billy Joe, as does almost everyone else in town, and is concerned that her reputation is ruined while Billy Joe becomes a folk hero. The neighbors have stopped speaking to Bobbie Lee's mother, and Glenn's deacon-ship with the church has been terminated after 20 years. James recommends that his sister seek an abortion, but Bobbie Lee says nothing in her own defense.One morning at dawn, Bobbie Lee leaves the farm with her suitcase and encounters Dewey Barksdale on the bridge. When she explains that she is leaving on the next bus, he tells her to stay and defend herself, aware that she is not pregnant. Barksdale admits that he was the man who seduced Billy Joe, and was on his way to tell her family. Bobbie Lee asks Dewey to keep his secret, believing that the truth would ruin both his life and the late Billy Joe's reputation. She is less concerned about herself, admitting that the scandal makes her feel like the heroine in a story from Torrid Romance. Barksdale requests the honor of driving Bobbie Lee to the depot.In a montage set one year later, James is married to his girlfriend Becky Thompson, Glenn has died from influenza, Anna is in mourning, and Bobbie Lee throws flowers off the Tallahatchie Bridge as a tribute to Billy Joe."
tt0075005,"['Horror', 'contentRating', 'R']","Rome, Italy, June 6, 1966, 6:00 am. Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is an American diplomat who hurries to a local hospital where his pregnant wife (Lee Remick) is going into labor. When he gets to the hospital, he is informed that his child was a stillbirth. A priest named Father Spiletto (Martin Benson) then offers him the choice to adopt a baby boy just born at the same time who has no parents. Thorn is reluctant to do so but knowing his wife will be devestated by the news of the death of her real child he agrees to the adoption.The boy is called Damien and moves to England with his mother and father when his father is appointed US ambassador to England. When Damien (Harvey Stephens) is celebrating his fifth birthday party, the family's nanny hangs herself in front of everyone and at the same time, the house is being watched by a rottweiler dog. In the background, a news photographer named Keith Jennings (David Warner) is present taking pictures.A few days later, a new nanny, named Mrs. Baylock (Billie Whitelaw) is sent to replace her but it is clear that she is not as she seems.Mrs. Baylock immediately challenges Kathy Thorn's authority when she is instructed to dress and ready Damien to attend a church wedding with them, but she does as she is told. As Thorn leaves the house, he is badgered by Jennings about circumstances around the previous nanny's death.The Thorns travel to the church one Sunday and Damien becomes more fearful as their car approaches the church. He has a violent reaction in which he injures his mother trying to get away. The car pulls away hurridly and while the Thorns discuss Damien's reaction and whether he should be examined by a doctor, they realize he has never been sick a day in his life.Later, in his office, Thorn is visited by a priest, named Father Brennan (Patrick Troughton), who claims to have been present during Damien's birth in Rome five years ago. He begs Thorn to accept Christ, because only then can he fight the son of the devil. The priest is escorted out by security and Jennings takes note of the visitor, snapping pictures. While developing the pictures of the day, Jennings notices the priest has a dark object like a javelin over his head in the pictures he appears in, but the anomaly doesn't appear anywhere else on the film.The next scene shows Kathy Thorn with Damien, traveling through a safari park, and various animals react with fear or anger towards Damien. It climaxes in a harrowing scene where a group of baboons attack the car that Kathy is driving forcing her to speed away.Meanwhile, Robert Thorn is followed by the priest that met with him earlier and is pulled aside at a public event; the priest tells him that his wife is in danger and he needs to talk to him. Jennings is also at the event, taking pictures. The pictures again show the dark anomaly above the priest.The next day, when Thorn meets with the priest again, Father Brennan again tells him that Damien is the son of the devil, born of a jackal, and will kill everyone around him and will kill his wife's unborn child as well as his wife. The priest instructs Thorn to go to Israel to the city of Megiddo to find a man who can tell him how to kill the son of the devil. Brennan tells Thron about an ancient prophecy that an antrichrist will be born, grow to manhood, and take over the world and lead it into death and destruction. Thorn thinks he is crazy and says never to bother him again. As the priest leaves the park, a sudden rainstorm comes up and the priest is impaled by a church spire in a freak accident while trying to get into a nearby church.Thorn goes home and his wife tells him she is pregnant. Startled by this news, he also receives a phone call telling him to examine the newspaper's cover story about the priest's bizarre death. Kathy has been agitated by Damien of late, causing her to visit a therapist, and tells Robert she wants to terminate the pregnancy. Disturbed by this, Thorn decides to go to the therapist to discuss Kathy's concerns. While Thorn is out, Damien's mother falls over a bannister after being knocked over by Damien, injuring her and thusly killing her unborn child.Jennings calls for Robert Thorn to meet him and he shows him the photographic anomalies with the old nanny and Father Brennan. Thorn tells him about the priest's warnings. Jennings said he is now involved because he found an anomaly on a picture of himself in which he has no neck. Jennings takes Thorn to the priest's residence, which he has access to due to the police investigation into his death, and they find an odd collection of crosses and Bible pages everywhere.Thorn and Jennings travel to Italy together to find the priest that gave him Damien at the hospital. They quickly learn that the hospital where Damien was born burned down in a mysterious fire five years ago, along with all the birth records. They go and find the priest, Father Spiletto, living in a remote monestery only to find him in very grave health. He is severly burned and has movement only in his left hand. Using a piece of charcoal, the priest points him in the direction of Damien's true mother.Thorn and Jennings travel to a local cemetery that lies in ruins, the former site of a shrine dedicated to the devil-god Techulca. They find the gravesites of both Damien's mother and the Thorns' baby... the mother's grave contains a jackal's remains, and the other grave contains a baby whose skull was crushed. Thorn realizes his baby was murdered (apparently by Spiletto and the Satanic conspirators) in order to swap its place with Damien. As they leave the cemetery, they are attacked by a pack of dogs led by a black rottweiler, and manage to escape.Robert calls his wife who is in hospital and tells her to come to Italy. However, she is thrown out of the hospital window by Mrs. Baylock as she gets up out of her bed.Back at the hotel, Thorn receives a phone call and finds out his wife has apparently jumped to her death from her hospital room. In his grief, he tells Jennings that he wants to go to Megiddo and that he wants Damien to die.Thorn and Jennings travel to Jerusalem and find that Megiddo is an archaelogic dig, almost completely underground. A man appears and takes them to Carl Bugenhagen (Leo McKern), the man the priest told Thorn to find. Bugenhagen is an elderly English archeologist who tells Thorn that he has been expecting him. He insists on talking to Thorn alone as Jennings is forced to wait outside the dig site. Bugenhagen gives Thorn seven special daggers, explains their significance and how to kill Damien. He also tells Thorn that Damien will have the mark of the Beast, three sixes, somewhere on his body.Thorn and Jennings leave, and Thorn flings the bundle of knives away saying he won't kill a child. Jennings goes after the knives, saying he will do it, and is suddenly killed in a freak accident when a truck mysteriously shifts into reverse by itself and a sheet of glass slides off the truck and decapitates Jennings in front of Thorn.Thorn flies home alone... with the knives, determined to kill Damien. When he returns to his house that night, he finds a rottweiler dog waiting for him, he succeeds in trapping it in the basement. Thorn then takes some scissors and searches the sleeping Damien's scalp for a birthmark in the form of a series of three sixes. Upon doing so, he discovers the sixes and all doubt about Damien's true identity are diminished. Mrs. Baylock then attacks him and as he takes Damien down the stairs. He fights her briefly before stabbing her with a kitchen knife. He then drags Damien into his car and speeds off to the local church.A police officer sees him speeding and pursues him. Thorn drives to the church with several police cars on his tail. He goes into the church and takes Damien kicking and screaming to the alter. He is about to stab him with the daggers, but he is shot by a police officer.The film ends with Robert Thorn and his wife's funeral in Arlington National Cemetery. Damien is seen having has been adopted by Robert's brother... who is the president of the United States. Damien looks into the camera and smiles somewhat menacingly as the prophecy of the antichrist is being fullfilled...."

tt0075066,"['Comedy', 'Crime']","At a psychiatric hospital, former Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is largely recovered from the murderous insanity that saw him repeatedly attempt to kill the thorn in his side, Inspector Jacques Clouseau (from the previous Pink Panther films, A Shot in the Dark, and Return of the Pink Panther). He is about to be released but Clouseau (Peter Sellers), who is now Chief Inspector and has arrived to speak on Dreyfus's behalf, comes to visit and his clumsiness and proneness to accidents drive Dreyfus insane again.Soon thereafter, Dreyfus escapes from the asylum, intent on killing Clouseau, who apparently had become a deranged good-cop-gone-bad. His first attempt involves planting a bomb under Clouseau's apartment whilst Clouseau destructively duels with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk), who is under orders to keep Clouseau alert by randomly attacking him. The bomb merely destroys Clouseau's apartment whilst Clouseau himself is unharmed, largely because Clouseau has been distracted by an inflatable costume and a telephone call. Cato ends up in the hospital.Using his knowledge of the underworld, Dreyfus frees Anthony Tournier (John Sullivan), a bank robber Clouseau had recently arrested, from prison. Other criminals with a grudge against Clouseau flock under their banner. His next step is to kidnap nuclear physicist Professor Hugo Fassbender (Richard Vernon) and the Professor's daughter Margo (Briony McRoberts), forcing the professor to build a ""doomsday weapon"" in return for his daughter's freedom. Because Hugo Fassbender fears to have his daughter harmed, he agrees.Clouseau travels to England to investigate Fassbender's disappearance, with typically chaotic results, as Scotland Yard Section Director Alec Drummond (Colin Blakely) and Superintendent Quinlan (Leonard Rossiter) painfully learn. Meanwhile Dreyfus broadcasts himself to the world to announce his ultimatum: destroy Clouseau or he will destroy mankind. Disintegrating the United Nations headquarters in New York City before the disbelieving eyes of the world, he blackmails the leaders of the world, including the President of the United States (a thinly veiled impersonation of Gerald Ford, advised by a similarly poorly camouflaged Henry Kissinger), into assassinating Clouseau.Forced to take Dreyfus's threat seriously, several nations send assassins to kill Clouseau at the Oktoberfest in Germany (whose antics include two accidentally shooting each other in bathroom stalls and one shooting another and then getting shot). Many of the nations, however, instruct their assassins to kill other assassins if necessary in order to win Dreyfus's favor and possibly get hold of the Doomsday Machine. This, combined with Clouseau's typical bumbling fashion, enables Clouseau to evade each assassination attempt just as it is about to happen, so that the assassins all kill each other instead. The assassins of 26 nations are killed in the attempt, so that the only survivors are the Egyptian (an uncredited cameo by Omar Sharif) and a Soviet Union operative. The Egyptian assassin, sneaking into Clouseau's hotel room, shoots a man he believes to be Clouseau (who is in fact Tournier, who had taken it upon himself to kill Clouseau). The Russian operative, Olga Bariosova (Lesley-Anne Down), who has sneaked into Clouseau's room, seduces the Egyptian, similarly mistaking him for Clouseau. His passionate sexuality convinces her not to assassinate him; when the real Clouseau makes an appearance, he is surprised to discover a beautiful woman in his bed who confuses him further by declaring her undying passion for him, and by finding a dead man in his bath. A tattoo on Tournier, combined with Olga's dismissively revealed knowledge, reveals to Clouseau Dreyfus's location at a castle in Bavaria, Germany.Dreyfus is elated at Clouseau's apparent demise, but his joy is soured by a bad case of toothache. Clouseau, who has arrived in the village near Dreyfus's castle and has unsuccessfully attempted to breach the castle, thwarted every time by a drawbridge that appears to be mocking him, eventually infiltrates Dreyfus's castle hideout disguised as a dentist, intoxicates Dreyfus with nitrous oxide, and pulls one of Dreyfus's healthy teeth. Realizing the deception and laughing hysterically, Dreyfus orders Clouseau killed, but Clouseau escapes.Enraged, Dreyfus means to seek vengeance on the world by destroying England; as he prepares for this, Clouseau, who has been thrown into the castle's barnyard, is literally catapulted onto Dreyfus's doomsday machine. Clouseau's weight redirects the disintegrator so that the beam hits Dreyfus (causing his feet to disappear) and Dreyfus's castle. As Dreyfus's henchmen, Fassbender, and his daughter, and eventually Clouseau himself escape the dissolving castle (Clouseau nearly thwarted by the drawbridge), Dreyfus himself plays ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" on the castle's pipe organ, laughing insanely and gradually disintegrating. The castle then disappears entirely, taking Dreyfus with it and destroying him once and for all (or so it seems).Returning to Paris, Clouseau is reunited with Olga, who has dismissed Cato for the evening and intends on completing her seduction of Clouseau. This is interrupted first by Clouseau's apparent inability to remove his clothes without a struggle, and then by Cato, who chooses this time to once more follow his orders and attack Clouseau and Olga. The consequent struggle ends when all three are hurled by a reclining bed into the Seine. Immediately thereafter, a cartoon image of Clouseau emerges from the water, which has been tinted pink, and begins swimming, unaware that a gigantic version of the Pink Panther character is waiting below him with a sharp-toothed, open mouth (a reference to the film Jaws made obvious by the thematic music). The film ends when the animated Clouseau gets chased by the shark in the water (which was actually the pink panther) as the credits roll."

Angry and dejected, Rocky leaves the gym.Rocky goes back to see Adrian at the pet store which is about to close for the night. Rocky asks her if she wants to go to see a basketball game, but she refuses the invitation. He then asks to walk her home and she again turns him down. He warns her about the people walking the streets at night and suggests that she take a taxi home.Rocky then goes to the Lucky 7 Tavern for a beer or two where he sees his best friend and Adrian's older brother, Paulie (Burt Young), cursing up a storm in the restroom after the mirror has been broken. Rocky tells him about Adrian and he shouts at Rocky that she's a loser and can't take care of herself. Paulie asks Rocky if he would like to take Adrian out on a date since she seldom leaves their house, and Rocky agrees. Paulie takes his beer and leaves. Rocky remains sitting at the bar drinking his own beer and watches TV and sees that the heavyweight boxing champion of the world, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is on TV. Rocky and the bartender talk about him until Rocky leaves.On his way home, Rocky notices a group of teenage kids standing on the corner drinking and smoking cigarettes and sees that one of them is Marie (Jodi Letizia), an underage teen girl he knows. He pulls her out of the group and walks her home. On the way, he tells her about respect and the kind of people that she should be hanging out with. After reaching her house, she calls Rocky ""Creepo"" and he heads back home.The next day in New York City, Apollo Creed and his trainer Tony are meeting with Miles Jergens (Thayer David), a fight promoter, discussing the possible fighters for him to match in the biggest fighting event set to take place on New Year's Day. When it looks like there are no possible fighters, Apollo has a epiphany: he'll take on a small time underdog fighter, giving him a shot at the title. Everyone agrees with the idea and the plan is set in motion.Meanwhile, Rocky is dropped off at his house by Gazzo and Buddy after his latest collection job, and they talk about Adrian. Rocky wonders how they knew about him and Adrian. Gazzo mildly replies: ""I hear things"". Buddy further insults Rocky by calling Adrian a retard and how retards like the zoo and Rocky attempts to lunge at him, but Gazzo separates them. He gives Rocky $50 for his date with Adrian. Before leaving, Buddy tells Rocky to take Adrian to the zoo and speeds off.At Apollo's office, he and Tony are looking through a book of local club fighters of Philadelphia and they come across Rocky who seems to be the perfect fighter. Apollo takes a liking to his nickname, ""The Italian Stallion.""That same evening, on the night of Thanksgiving, Rocky and Paulie are walking home and Paulie keeps imploring Rocky to get him a job with Gazzo as a collector, because he hates his current job at a meat packing factory. They reach Paulie's house where Adrian is making Thanksgiving dinner. She comes out of the kitchen to greet Paulie but doesn't realize Rocky is with him. Rocky says 'hello' and she walks back into the kitchen. Paulie goes to talk to her and she runs into her bedroom embarrassed. Paulie gets her out and tells to go out with Rocky for the night, but Adrian claims that it's Thanksgiving and she's cooking a turkey. Paulie goes to the kitchen and grabs the turkey out of the oven and throws it out the back door. Adriana begins to cry and Paulie yells at her to go out. Rocky tells him to forget the date but Paulie instructs him to go talk to her. Rocky walks over to her door and talks to her through the door but doesn't get any feedback. He asks her if she wants to go out with him and have a good time and she opens the door all dressed up ready to go.On Paulie's advice, Rocky and Adrian head for the local ice rink. They look around and see that it's empty and the maintenance man (George Memmoli) tells them that the rink is closed for the night. Rocky bribes him $10 and they have the rink for themselves for 10 minutes. Adrian's skating as Rocky is running along side her telling her about the fights he's been in and how it's special to him.After their date, Rocky and Adrian go back to his apartment where she is hesitant about going inside. Rocky implores her that its okay and she follows behind him. Inside his apartment, Adrian feels uncomfortable admitting that she's never been in a man's apartment before. Rocky admits he doesn't feel comfortable neither and he's kind of nervous too. She wants to leave but Rocky stops her, trying to cheer her up giving her compliments. He tells her that she wants to kiss her and he does and the two end up kissing in his corner by the door.The next day, Rocky heads for Mickey's Gym and Mick tells him that Jergens' office called, possibly asking for sparring partners. Rocky says the same thing to himself and a frustrated Mick yells at him. Rocky asks why after all this time Mick's been giving him the cold shoulder, but Mick refuses to reply. Rocky demands to know and Mick yells at him across the gym that Rocky had the talent and the heart to be a great fighter but instead became a ""leg-breaker"" for the local loan shark and bookie Tony Gazzo. Rocky defends his occupation and that it's a living, but Mick retorts that it's a waste of life and he again calls Rocky ""a bum"".Rocky goes to see Jergens and tells him that he is willing to help out with the sparring training with Creed and tells him that he'd give it his all. Jergens then offers Rocky a proposition into fighting with Creed on on New Year's Day, however, Rocky declines. Jergens tells Rocky that it was him that Creed chose to fight and that its a once in a lifetime shot to win the heavyweight boxing title. Rocky takes a minute to consider it.Back at Paulie's house, Rocky, Adrian, and Paulie watch a TV interview with Apollo and Rocky about the upcoming fight and they see that Apollo's been taunting Rocky through the whole session. Paulie tells Rocky that he should break his legs and that he should be able to win the fight. Rocky says that the taunts don't bother him. Adrian tells Paulie has a good chance of winning. Paulie gets up and storms out of the room cursing loudly. Rocky gets ready to leave and Adrian follows him outside. Before leaving, Rocky admits to Adrian that the stuff said on TV actually hurt him inside.The following evening, Rocky meets with Gazzo outside Pat's Steakhouse grill where they get some steak sandwiches to eat and to talk about Rocky being chosen to fight Apollo. Gazzo gives Rocky $500 for training expenses and wishes him the best.A few hours later, Mick, having heard about Rocky's shot at the title goes to see Rocky at his apartment and he begins telling him about his old days as a featherweight fighter during the 1930s and all the injuries he endured. He tells Rocky that he wants to become a manager for him. Rocky tells him that he asked for help years ago but Mick turned him down. A defeated Mick gets ready to leave as Rocky is sitting in his bathroom. After Mick leaves, Rocky starts shouting to Mick about his asking to help him. Mick is half-way up the street and Rocky runs up to him and apologizes to him.Early the next morning, Rocky gets up at 4:00 a.m. and prepares for a morning run. He drinks a half-dozen raw eggs. Rocky starts his run through the Philly streets and at the end, attempts to run up the stairs of the Philadelphia Art Museum but can't reach it all the way because he's out of shape and out of breath.Later, Rocky goes to see Paulie at the meat processing plant where he works. They talk about Adrian, with Paulie, speaking derogatorily, asks if Rocky is sleeping with his sister. Rocky becomes annoyed to the point where he admits the truth about why he can't talk to Gazzo about giving Paulie a job working for him: Paulie talks too much. Rocky says he's ready to leave because of the cold and the smell of the meat factory, a frustrated Paulie begins hitting a huge side of beef hanging from the ceiling, taunting Rocky. Rocky steps over and beings throwing punches into the meat, breaking the ribs. Paulie jokes at Rocky saying if he did that to Apollo Creed he'd be put in jail for murder. Rocky takes the meat that Paulie's prepared him for the week and leaves.At Paulie's apartment, Adrian cares to Rocky's cut up hands from hitting the meat. She begins to get intimate with him but he keeps backing her off, telling her that there's no ""foolin' around"" during training. Adrian near upset gets up and goes to the kitchen, Rocky gets up and follows her and apologizes and they embrace.Rocky begins training with Mick and Mike the janitor at the gym. Two girls walk in and ask for Rocky's autograph, Mick dismisses them harshly and tells Rock that ""women weaken legs"" and to lay off ""the pet shop dame"": Adrian. Rocky tells him that he really likes her, and Mick shouts back at Rocky telling him to let her train him for women are a distraction to his training. Rocky takes a second and agrees with Mick and will not fool around anymore.A few days later, Rocky is jogging back to his apartment building where Adrian is waiting on the steps with a surprise for him. She has purchased and given Rocky Butkus, the big Bulldog Mastiff from the pet shop. Rocky begins jogging around with Butkus days later. One day, Rocky and Butkus run to Paulie's workplace to find a TV news van in the back. Rocky finds Paulie and he tells Rocky that he needs publicity but Rocky, now mad, wanted privacy. Rocky and Paulie go inside and meet with the news reporter and they ask Rocky for a demonstration on how he trains with the meat. He begins to jab at the meat as the news camera looks onto him. Tony, Apollo's trainer, is watching the interview and sees that Rocky means business.On Christmas Eve, Paulie is walking home, clearly drunk. Rocky and Adrian are already there watching a Christmas movie on TV. They start talking about Paulie about what he did with the publicity stint back at the slaughterhouse. A drunken Paulie, overhearing the conversation, enters the room and threatens the both of them to leave his house. When they refuse to leave, Paulie grabs a baseball bat and threatens Rocky that he'll break both his arms. He begins swinging at a lamp and then breaks the end table next to Rocky and Adrian. Paulie begins ranting that he never done anything wrong to Rocky and he even let him go out with his sister. Paulie then admits the truth about why he hates Adrian so much and then begins smashing more things with the bat. Paulie shouts at Adrian that she owes him, but Adrian yells back saying that it is she who takes care of Paulie. Another insulting remark by Paulie about Adrian sends her running to her room crying. Rocky angrily grabs Paulie ready to punch him, but he quickly realizes that Paulie is too drunk and weak. Rocky lets go of Paulie and walks into Adrian's room to comfort her. She asks Rocky if he'd like a roommate and that she is moving out of Paulie's house.A couple of days later, Rocky is at the gym training again with Mick and Mike. After the session, Mick introduces Rocky to their cut-man Al Silvani. Rocky gets out of the ring as Mick and Al talk, and he begins hitting a heavy bag. Paulie walks in and offers Rocky an advertising job for him. Rocky tells him if he can make money off his name, do it.The famous montage of the movie starts with Rocky running around Philadelphia, then in the gym, hitting a speed-bag, doing push-ups and sit-ups. Then in the meat factory as Rocky hits the meat once more. Rocky then runs up the stairs of the Art Museum and this time, he is able to make it all the way to the top.The next night, Rocky and Adrian are in bed at his apartment but Rocky can't sleep, he gets out of bed, puts his coat on and walks to the Spectrum arena. Rocky stands in the center of the ring and looks around to see that the place is well decorated and ready for the fight. Jergens shows up and Rocky tells him how the stripes on his shorts are wrong in the giant painting of him but Jergens dismisses it, saying he believes Rocky is going to give the world an incredible show. Rocky goes back home as Adrian slowly awakes as Rocky lays down on the bed upset. He tells her that he won't be able to beat Apollo and how no one has ever gone the distance with him before.New Years Day, 1976. On the night of the fight, Rocky and Apollo are both getting prepared. When Rocky gets the cue that it's time, he leaves Adrian down at the locker room as she wishes him good luck. Rocky starts making his way towards the ring as some of the crowd cheers for him. Among the court-side crowd is Paulie with a call-girl, as well as Gazzo with another woman at his side. When he reaches the ring. Rocky, Mick and Mike watch as Apollo comes out dressed like George Washington as a dedication to the American Bicentennial. He reaches the ring and dons an Uncle Sam hat. Both fighters receive instructions and rules for the fight. They return to their corners and wait for the bell. The fight begins and Apollo begins throwing punches at Rocky but most of them miss. Apollo apparently isn't taking the fight seriously as he begins to throw a hay-maker at Rocky but he dodges it and swings at Apollo knocking him down. The crowd goes wild and Apollo gets back up and the fight continues with the two of them throwing punches at each other and dodging most of them.As the rounds progress, both Rocky and Apollo become increasingly cut-up and bruised. Rocky's right eye is so swollen he can't open it. Apollo is getting tired and hurt badly with Rocky throwing punches to the body. At Round 14, Apollo finally knocks Rocky down and Mick instructs him to stay down until the count is up. Adrian comes out of the locker room and watches the ring and believes in Rocky and hopes he'll get up. Rocky gets back up and Apollo, dancing around the ring, sees with distress that Rocky is standing and wants more. Apollo, now exhausted, throws a punch a Rocky, but Rocky ducks and jabs him twice in his right chest breaking his ribs. The bell rings signaling the end of the round and the fighters are brought back to their corners. Rocky claims he can't see anything and tells Mick to cut him in order to open his eye.The bell for the 15th and final round rings, and Rocky and Apollo take their time until Apollo tags Rocky in the face. Rocky moves in as Apollo is now protecting the right side of his ribs. More punches to the faces occur on both of them until Rocky gets the last 10 seconds of the round and beats Apollo senseless and pinning him to the ropes. By this time, the whole crowd is cheering Rocky on by chanting his name over and over. The bell rings signaling the end of the fight. Apollo tells Rocky that there won't be a rematch and Rocky responds that he doesn't want one. The ring is stormed by reporters and both the fighters managers. A reporter asks Rocky questions about the fight as Rocky shouts for Adrian. While Adrian makes her way to the ring, Jergens announces that the fight came out to be a draw and it was a split decision on who won. Apollo is allowed to retain his status at the heavyweight champion and technically wins by default. A blinded Rocky doesn't seem to hear, or be bothered by, the result of the fight as he continues to shout for Adrian.Adrian makes it to ringside to see Paulie being restrained from entering the ring. Adrian sneaks in and runs to Rocky, the two embrace and declare their love for each other."

tt0075222,"['Comedy', 'contentRating', 'Passed']","The film is set in Hollywood, in present day Los Angeles and is a silent film. Mel Funn (Mel Brooks), a great film director, is now recovering from a drinking problem and down on his luck. He sets out to Big Picture Studios to pitch a new script to the Chief, aided by his ever-present sidekicks Dom Bell (Dom DeLuise) and Marty Eggs (Marty Feldman). His big idea: the first silent motion picture in forty years. At first the Chief (Sid Caesar), who is in danger of losing the studio to the (literally) rabid and greedy New York conglomerate Engulf & Devour (Harold Gould and Ron Carey), rejects the idea, but Funn convinces him that if he can get Hollywood's biggest stars to be in the film, he could save the studio.Funn, Eggs, and Bell proceed to recruit various people for the film. Their first target is Burt Reynolds, whom they first surprise in his shower. This does not go well, but they are able to sign him on by appearing at his house in disguise (and almost getting him killed by a steamroller). They recruit James Caan despite a disastrous lunch in his broken trailer, and then torture Liza Minnelli at the studio commissary (fortunately, she already badly wanted to be in the movie). They then disguise themselves as Flamenco dancers to get close to Anne Bancroft at a nightclub, and sign her on as well after a comical dance sequence. News breaks out that the Chief has taken ill and is in the hospital. While there, Mel phones Marcel Marceau in Paris who apparently declines the offer, delivering the only line of dialogue in the film, in French: ""Non!"" When asked by the others what Marceau said, Funn explains he doesn't understand French. Paul Newman is seen on the hospital grounds. After leading them on a wild Hollywood-style chase in electric wheelchairs, he asks to be in the film. Funn and company reply with the typical Hollywood-esque ""We'll get back to you."" In the next shot, a newspaper ad indicates that they ""ink"" Newman to do the movie.In the process of their search for stars, the trio have a number of brief but funny misadventures, including a mixup between two German Shepherds (one trained as a seeing-eye dog, the other most assuredly not), a flying blueberry pie, and several (mostly unsuccessful) efforts by Marty Eggs to seduce various women. Their most notable encounter involves a Coca-Cola machine that dispenses cans by launching them like grenades.Engulf and Devour, meanwhile, worry that Funn will save Big Picture Studios and they will be unable to buy it. They attempt to ""stop Funn with sex"" by sending voluptuous nightclub sensation Vilma Kaplan (Bernadette Peters) to seduce Funn and pretend to be in love with him. Funn falls head over heels, but when Eggs and Bell reveal the truth to him on the day before filming begins, the director returns to drinking. Ironically, moments after this turn of events, Vilma is seen calling Mr. Engulf with the news that she is quitting: she has fallen for Funn for real. We see Mel stopping by a liquor store and buying what first appears to be an advertising prop in the store's window, but is actually a genuine giant bottle of liquor. After a misadventure involving a Skid Row hotel room and a murphy bed, Funn ends up in an alley where he dispenses booze from his giant bottle and is proclaimed ""King of the Winos"". After a few hours of hitting the local gin mills, Vilma and Funn's associates find the would-be ""King"" passed out in a pile of his ""subjects"", but several hundred cups of coffee sober him up. Funn's silent movie is completed in record time. Unfortunately, the only copy of it is stolen from the theater by Engulf & Devour just before its big premiere.Vilma volunteers to stall the movie theater's audience with her nightclub act while Funn and his associates go out to steal back their film. They succeed, but are chased by Engulf and Devour's thuggish executives. They are eventually cornered, but fortunately they are near the violent Coke machine, which they use against their foes. Most of the executives, including Mr. Devour, are disabled by the exploding cans of Coke, allowing Funn, Eggs, and Bell to escape. They hurry the film to the theater, where it is shown for the first time. In the meantime, Eggs has gotten himself tangled up in the film and he is immediately rushed up to the projection booth with the film wrapped around him. After the movie is over, the audience applauds wildly and leaps to its feet while balloons and streamers fill the air. ""They seem to like it,"" Funn says.The film ends with the jubilant audience filing out of the theater past Funn, Eggs, Bell, Vilma, and the recovered studio chief. At the end, a title card is shown: ""This was a true story."""
tt0075223,"['Action', 'Comedy', 'Crime', 'Romance', 'Thriller']","George Caldwell (Gene Wilder) is a divorced and mild-mannered book editor that wants to relax and take a train to Chicago for the next 2 days so he can ""be bored for a while"". Shortly after getting on the train, he meets a friendly vitamin salesman named Bob Sweet (Ned Beatty). Not long afterward, a woman named Hilly Burns (Jill Clayburgh) wants to have dinner with him. He accidentally barged into her compartment next door to his while she was disrobing. The two of them share over 2 bottles of champagne together and stay in the diner until closing. Hilly is working as a secretary for a Professor Schreiner, a semi-reclusive history professor that is about to give a speech at a university.Briefly we see a small group of thugs beating up a bearded man. George and Hilly retire for the night and make love. Just as she is caressing him, he sees a man fall from the roof of his window off the train. George reacts in horror and Hilly believes he drank too much and hallucinating.George wakes up the next day and finds a book and shows Hilly the photo on the back cover of it, who was the bearded man he saw murdered last night. Hilly says that's Professor Schreiner and still refuses to believe George. She tells him where his compartment is so George can see himself that he's okay.George passes by Bob Sweet in the dining area, who wants to have breakfast with him, but George says he'll be right back to join him. He knocks on the door of Professor Schreiner's compartment and a sinister looking 60-ish man with a cigarette in his mouth (Ray Walston) answers the door. George says he wants to see the professor and the man tells him he's sticking his nose where it doesn't belong and that he and Hilly are in trouble. George refuses to comply and tries to let himself in. The man tells Reace (Richard Kiel, Jaws in the James Bond movies), a thuggish seven foot tall man that doesn't speak, to get rid of George and without hesitation, Reace opens a door and throws George off the train.George is somewhere in Arizona or New Mexico and frustrated at having been thrown off the train being stuck in the middle of a desert. He finds a farm in the middle of the desert and meets an eccentric, but very warm and friendly old woman named Rita Babtree (Lucille Benson). She takes George to her single engine crop duster airplane and gives him the thrill of his life a ride in the plane to the next town. He was going to give the local sheriff information about the incident he's witnessed, but by the time they arrive at the train depot, the train is already taking off. George runs to the train and the convention crowd in the back catch him and get him on. They are now approaching the Rocky Mountains on their journey.George is back on the train. It is now lunchtime and he sees Hilly in the dining compartment with an elegant looking man having lunch with her. Bob Sweet encounters George telling him he wanted to have George join him for breakfast, but now it's lunch. George confesses he was ""squeezing tits"", which he did when he was at Rita's farm milking a cow and Bob jokes with him about being a horny devil. He tells George that man Hilly is having lunch with is Roger Devereau (Patrick McGoohan), a millionaire art dealer in Chicago.George is now back in his compartment, then opens the door to Hilly's and she tells him she was worried about him, embraces him, and that what he witnessed was a hallucination. Devereau comes into Hilly's compartment and introduces himself to George apologizing about the incident with him being thrown off the train. Edgar Whiney, the sinister looking man George encountered at Professor Schreiner's compartment is surprised to see George and blames Reace for throwing George off. Then a bearded man (Stefan Gierasch) comes into the compartment telling Deverau the papers have been found. He introduces himself as Professor Schreiner. He tells them he is tired from the stress of the searching for the missing papers and will rest and have a scotch. George apologizes for intruding into their business affairs and goes back into his compartment. Whiney snickers and Devereau slaps Hilly across the face afterwards.George is in the bar and getting drunk. Bob Sweet comes back in acting like he assumes George is having woman problems. George tells him about what has happened since last night, Bob keeps asking him questions about the people he's dealt with, George is perplexed as to why Bob is asking him all these questions and tells him Schreiner was met just a little while ago and wanted to have a scotch and lie down. It turns out Bob Sweet is actually Stevens, a federal agent.Stevens tells George he's been working on a case for the past 2 years tailing Roger Devereau to get him arrested. In actuality, Schreiner despises Devereau and wants nothing to do with him and a health food nut that doesn't touch alcohol and that the man claiming to be Schreiner is an imposter. He assures George that Schreiner has been murdered and he didn't hallucinate. Stevens takes George to a storage compartment that Schreiner was probably confronted at, then the top of the train. Stevens walks over to an area that's above George's compartment and finds a piece of torn clothing. George realizes he was right. Stevens knows Devereau murdered Schreiner over something, because Schreiner was going to give a speech about some letters that were going to prove Devereau's art in his gallery were forgeries. George realizes that ""Rembrandt letters"" were mentioned by the imposter earlier. George and Stevens go back into his compartment and gets a book he saw earlier with actual manuscripts Rembrant himself wrote over 300 years ago. Stevens is amazed at what he found and that the letters will bring down Deverau's art gallery business declaring him a fraud. He also mentions Devereau had a plane crash in Cologne, Germany two years before killing over 100 people to cover up an art scandal. He tells George to push a button for the porter and to have the train stop in Dodge City to have Devereau arrested. A knock is on the door, Stevens answers, then everything goes dark and shots fired. Stevens has been shot and knows George was the intended target because of his knowledge and to take his gun. He dies from the wounds.The porter (Scatman Crothers) comes to George's compartment and outraged George shot Stevens. George storms out and tells him he didn't do it. Whiney sees George and surprised he's not dead. Reace sees George, shoots at him, then tries to tail him. Reace looks for him in the storage compartment, then at the top of the train. George confronts him and shoots him off. Shortly afterwards, George encounters a railway signal, bumping into it, holding on, then falling off once again.George is now off the train once again in Colorado and gets a ride to the sheriff's office in a small town. He meets a fat hayseed Sheriff named Chaunsey (Clifton James). George is rattled and tries to tell Chauncey his story, because the sheriff has never dealt with a murder before. Chanuncey is befuddled by the story, but then gets a phone call. It turns out a federal agent is on the phone wanting George for murder and Chaunsey is surprised and finds George a bit nutty. Chauncey confronts George and pulls a gun on him. George pulls the gun from the sheriff declaring him for being incompetent and that he's trying to save a life. His deputy pulls up in a police vehicle and George hijacks it pointing a gun at Chauncey and the deputy.George is in the police vehicle driving and a handcuffed man in the backseat gets up and startles him. The man is Grover Muldoon (Richard Pryor), a slick and charming car thief impressed at the way George handled the situation. George tells Grover what he's accused of, but Grover wants to be dropped off and doesn't ""deal with the big M"". But they stay together. Grover takes the wheel knowing they will be setting up roadblocks on the Kansas state line and crashes into the cars escaping the police.Hilly is on the train in her compartment and Devereau is questioning her about her involvement with George and she swears they just met, but Devereau assures her, they will take care of her in the meantime until they see George again.George and Grover are at a used car lot attempting to steal a Jaguar. A night watchman pulls a gun on Grover for attempting to steal it, then George tackles the man to the ground knocking him out. Grover assures him they'll make it in time to Kansas City in the early morning to get George back on the Silver Streak. The entire time driving George is worried if Hilly is still alive.George and Grover arrive at the train terminal in Kansas City. They discover federal agents are at the ticket counter and George is on the front cover of a newspaper wanted for murder. In the movie's most famous and hilarious scene ever, Grover takes George under his wing and purchases a hat, radio, and brown shoe polish from a shoe shiner. Grover's intention is to make George pass as a black man. He's having trouble as George is having difficulty with the rhythm of the blues music and dancing very much like a white man. George is now wearing Grover's purple sport jacket, the shoeshiner's hat, brown shoe polish on his face, and sunglasses. He comes out of the men's room looking and acting downright ridiculous and Grover hopes no Muslims are there to see them. Grover is asked by one of the agents if he's seen the white man wanted and Grover replies, ""No, but if I see any, I'll let you know"". George makes it past them and on the train.George goes into his compartment to discover all his personal effects are gone. Grover tells George to give him some cash for him to wear a porter's uniform. George is getting fed up with giving up his money for disguises, but does it anyway. He rinses his face off, then finds Hilly in his compartment. George is knocked out cold, then wakes up a little while later. Hilly comforts him and tells him that she had no choice but to accept Devereau's plan that Schreiner was killed or else she was going to be killed, too. George had the Rembrandt letters in his jacket pocket and they were taken. The two embrace and are just glad to be back together. Edgar Whiney comes into his compartment pulls out a gun and tells George and Hilly Devereau wants to see them.George and Hilly meet with Devereau in his compartment to join him for breakfast. Devereau is reviewing the letters and loves their historical authenticity, then gives them to Whiney to put in a safe. He tells George that Professor Schreiner actually killed himself and jumped off the train and that they were actually going to kill him later, but because he refused to cooperate and give them the Rembrandt letters, it messed up their plans. Johnson, the man who played the false Professor Schreiner, comes in the compartment now without glasses, a beard, and foreign accent. It turns out he's an employee of Devereau's and another dangerous man. He tells Devereau they will land in Rockdale within 1 1/2 hours, which is where they plan to get off at instead of Chicago, then leaves. Devereau now very calmly tells George and Hilly that there will be a new scenario that they kill each other in 45 minutes. The porter arrives with toast, marmalade, and coffee. It turns out Grover is playing the role of a porter. Grover jokes around with and annoys Devereau about how ""we aims to please"" and ""ain't bullshittin' about the cuisine"", then pretends to accidentally pour coffee in Devereau's lap with Devereau calling Grover ""an ignorant nigger"". Grover pulls a gun on him threatening him, then George pulls Devereau's gun from his jacket. George now declares to Devereau that man he had shot was a federal agent and they've been tailing him for the past 2 years. He tells Devereau to go back to the safe and get the Rembrandt letters. George points a gun at Whiney to get the letters out, but Johnson shoots at George and Grover. George and Grover leave the train. This is the third time George has left the train.George and Grover land in a pond right off the train and apprehended by local authorities.

However, John insists on going out somewhere.He is taken to a bar where Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) is singing her own songs. John has taken a bottle of whiskey with him but the bar is unlicensed and only tea, coffee or herbal tea is available to buy and the waitress tries to get John to give her the alcohol to look after until he leaves but John insists on keeping the bottle with him. Finally, Esther steps in the conversation and allows him to drink it as long as he doesn't make a scene while she is singing. John Howard gets mesmerized by Esther.Soon after, a couple of John's fans find him in the bar and intrude on him by sitting at his table uninvited. The male fan talks loudly over the singing even though John asks him not to. The fan, who is high on something, gets angry at John, asking if he thinks he's too good for them. The fan throws a punch and the two then end up in a fight. Esther and her backup singers take cover as the situation disintegrates. The bar owner manages to break up the fight, announces they are closing, and calls the police.

He asks one of his entourage if they tried her home and they say she wasn't home. When he does manage to find her, it turns out she tried calling him but three times the phone wasn't answered and the fourth time she heard a message saying the phone was disconnected. John thinks about it and tells her it would have been because his phone number is changed every six weeks to keep calls from fans in the middle of the night to a minimum because they keep finding out his number.John takes Esther to his mansion. He writes her name on the wall with a can of spray paint. There, they make love, have a bath together, and he listens to her ad-libbing on his piano.

The DJ who wouldn't accept John's apology, is heard on the radio saying that John was one of his closest friends and that John was one of the greats.At Esther's next concert, as she steps up to the microphone and the lights are dimmed, the entire audience quietly raises candles as tribute to her lost husband. Touched, Esther softly begins singing one of John's trademark songs that his group performed early in the film, but as a ballad rather than a rock song. It gradually leads into more powerful singing, all of it focusing on their love, the impact he had on her life and the effect on her of his loss."
tt0075276,"['Comedy', 'Drama']","Just released from a jail term of 2 1/2 years in Berlin, Bruno Stroszek goes through all of the formalities of being released and is given back all of his personal belongings: one sweater, one shirt, a pair of pants, a pair of socks, an accordion, five packs of cigarettes, a bugle horn, a keychain and his passport. Back in his cell, he bids farewell to his cellmates and they exchange gifts. One makes for him the smallest paper ship in the world and the other sets his flatulence ablaze. He then meets with the warden, who asks him if he has a place to live now that he is free, to which Bruno replies that his apartment had been taken care of by his neighbour, Herr Scheitz. He is then asked whether or not he'll go back to consuming alcohol since all of his past offences had been alcohol-related and that if he were to be caught again for similar crimes, that he'd be locked away for a longer period of time. Bruno seems uninterested and is then recommended that he clean himself up and once again, to stay away from bars and alcohol. He finally promises and is subsequently released.During his walk home, he stops at a bar called 'Bier Himmel' (Beer Heaven) and orders a beer. As he walks to sit at a booth, he sees his friend Eva, a prostitute. He attempts greeting her but is told to leave her alone by her pimps who were there trying to extort money from a former client of Eva's. She then starts crying on one of the pimps, telling him she doesn't want to be with any other pimp. He stands up and slaps her across the face, to which Eva starts crying and walks away towards where Bruno is sitting. He tells her to sit with him and tries to reassure her that everything will be OK. Eva asks him where he had been, to which Bruno responded: 'vacation'. She is still distraught and asks herself 'what she's going to do' and 'where she's going to go', to which Bruno responds by telling her she can stay at his apartment and that they can both start new lives together.As she sets up her belongings, Bruno is playing his pianos to see if they are still in good condition after not being played for so long. His favorite piano is a black grand piano he calls 'Schwarze Freund' (black friend). They notice how the apartment is dirty and Eva says she'd take care of everything by earning money. Bruno's neighbour, Herr Scheitz, arrives with his minah bird he had been taking care of in his absence. He then tells Bruno and Eva of his plans to move to America and stay with his nephew - but by ship, since according to Scheitz, airplanes are not built correctly. In the next scene, Bruno goes back to his ritualistic ways of playing his accordion in an alleyway to an audience of mostly children. When he arrives at his apartment, he sees Eva's pimps waiting for him outside his door and leaves running the opposite way. He finds Eva at a restaurant with her pimps and is quickly kicked out. He retreats back to his apartment and talks to Scheitz about what is happening with Eva, when at that moment, the pimps are dragging her up the stairs and into the living room, dump trash on her and break one of Bruno's accordions. Bruno helps her get up and into bed.The next day, Bruno is out buying some fruits and sees that the pimps are watching him, from whom he instantly runs away. While playing his piano at home, the pimps walk in and start harassing him. Now himself being distraught from the constant trouble the pimps are making, he sees his doctor and asks him for advice since he can't defend himself. The doctor tells him he should start off by getting a steady job and then takes him to the premature baby ward in order to further explain the concept of life and its many unanswered questions. He used a premature baby to symbolize how he could barely survive on his own but had such strong grip reflexes although considered weak.Back at the apartment, Scheitz is waiting for him to arrive and shows him what the pimps had done to Eva, which was to once again physically abuse her. Bruno asks her if she wants him to call the police to report it only to be told no and how they need to escape the whole mess. They decide to go with Scheitz to America and finance the tickets/Visas by Eva earning more money by selling her body a few more times. Scheitz reports back to them and informs Bruno that he can work as a mechanic at his nephew's auto shop and that Eva can work at a nearby restaurant at a truck stop.They arrive in America and Bruno's bird Beo gets confiscated by customs, to which he asks Eva and Scheitz: What kind of country is this that they take away my Beo? After a little sightseeing in New York, they purchase a used car and drive out to Railroad Flats, Wisconsin. When they arrive, Scheitz's nephew, Clayton, greets them with a misspelled sign in German, saying: Welcome. Meet & Greet time is followed by picture-taking and they learn how Clayton was once stationed at the US Air Force base in Ramstein. They get a short tour of the town by Clayton and are then told by him about the mysterious disappearance of a farmer who drove out into the woods on his large tractor never to be found again. He claims the wreckage is probably underwater in one of the nearby lakes and periodically searches for it with a metal detector when they're frozen over.Once settled in, they learn about the situation between two farmers nearby that patrol a stretch of land labeled: no-mans land and are told to stay away since both carry rifles and could potentially start firing at each other at any moment. The pre-fabricated house they had ordered arrives and is fully furnished. Scheitz is then seen outside performing electro-magnetic experiments on a fence and then on 2 American hunters on the side of the road- in German- to which of course they don't understand. He then tells Bruno and Eva about his animal magnetism theory and performs his testing on their skin. In the next scene, they are all seen on and around a frozen lake with a metal detector in their search for the lost tractor.Realizing that theyre falling behind on paying all of their bills, Bruno and Eva discuss this, to which Eva tells Bruno not to worry because she could take care of everything. She accomplishes this by sleeping with truckers that stop by her work. Soon after, theyre visited by a bank representative who informs them of their lack of payments and the possibility of repossessions if they continue to not pay. Eva hands him a wad of cash and is asked by Bruno how she had made so much money in that little time. In the next scene, Bruno shows Eva a model/schematic of his state of mind (which appears to be wood or metal that is intertwined). He tells her how their goals in the US cant be reached because he saw America as an opportunity to get rich quick. He also points out that shes acting differently around him, primarily by not letting him sleep in the same bedroom, it feels like prison he says, like a cage. At work, Clayton is making sexually suggestive comments about Eva and Bruno says he was better off in Germany and that he shouldn't have come to America to watch his world fall apart.The next day, Eva is with some truckers once again as Bruno looks for her at the restaurant. Not being able to find her there, he then tries searching around where the trucks are parked. He finds Eva in a truck with 2 truckers and is told to leave because she was going to Vancouver with them. Drinking his sorrows away at home, Bruno is once again visited by the bank representative and is told that the bank has to repossess everything and signs the house away. Soon after, the bank rep and an auctioneer arrive at the house and auction it off. Scheitz claims it is all a conspiracy and goes to the bank the next day with Bruno and a shotgun. Because the bank was closed, they enter a door next to it which happened to be for a barber. They take all of his money, twenty-five dollars, and walk across the street to a market to buy food. Once inside, the police arrive and arrest Scheitz, leaving Bruno and a frozen turkey he had just bought. He then drives back to Claytons house and leaves with his tow-truck, the frozen turkey, some cans of beer, and the shotgun.He drives until an engine fire starts in the truck at a diner. Once there, he stops to get a coffee with his last $3 and tells an American businessman who can speak some German all about his troubles and is told by him not to worry. When he leaves, he puts the truck in drive and leaves it driving itself in circles outside of the restaurant, and takes his gun and frozen turkey across the street to what seems to be some sort of mini animal amusement park. Inside are coin-operated machines which feature animals performing different things like one chicken dancing, one playing a piano, and a rabbit fire truck rider. Bruno starts some of them with the last of his change and then goes to the back of the facility, which has a chairlift. He turns it on and rides up the side of the mountain. At the second ascent, the frame of the camera shifts up, not being able to see Bruno any longer. At that moment, a loud noise is heard which is unclear where it comes from.Its been said that the noise is either from the sound of his shotgun from his suicide or the tow-trucks engine exploding. At the end of the movie, police are on the street and are reporting back to their headquarters stating: We've got a truck on fire, can't find the switch to turn the ski lift off, and can't stop the dancing chicken. Send an electrician."
tt0075314,"['Crime', 'Drama']","Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) goes to a New York City taxi depot where he applies for a job as a driver to the tough-talking personnel officer (Joe Spinell). Travis claims that he is an honorably discharged Marine (it is implied that he is a Vietnam Veteran). After making an impression on the personnel officer, Travis gets the job for the night shift due to his chronic insomnia.Via his narrative journal, Travis is soon revealed to be a lonely and depressed young man of 26 years. His origins and hometown are unknown. He sends his parents letters as well as birthday and Christmas cards, lying about his life and saying he works with the Secret Service. Travis spends his restless days alone in his rundown apartment somewhere in Manhattan, or in seedy porn theaters on and off 42nd Street. At one porn theater he tries to make an advance on the concession lady to no avail. He works 12 or 14 hour shifts during the evening and night time hours carrying passengers among all five boroughs of New York City. Sometimes during his breaks, he goes to a local all-night diner to have something to eat or just a few cups of coffee where fellow taxi drivers also hang out during their late-night lunch breaks. One of whom is a self-appointed philosophical type named Wizard (Peter Boyle). Wizard talks about the degradation of the night time in the city. Travis barely interacts with the other taxi drivers, mainly speaking awkwardly and shyly when he's spoken to.During taxi driving, Travis spies and becomes infatuated with a woman named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a campaign volunteer for New York Senator Charles Palantine, who is running for the presidential nomination and is promising dramatic social change. Travis spies Betsy joking with a co-worker named Tom (Albert Brooks). Travis works up the nerve to ask her out and Betsy is initially intrigued by Travis. She agrees to a date with him after he flirts with her over coffee and sympathizes with her own apparent loneliness. She compares him to a character in the Kris Kristofferson song ""The Pilgrim.""Travis is further revolted by what he considers the moral decay around him. One night while on shift, Iris (Jodie Foster), a 12-year-old child prostitute, gets in his cab, attempting to escape her pimp. Shocked by the occurrence Travis fails to drive off quickly enough and her pimp, ""Sport"" (Harvey Keitel), reaches the cab. Sport forcibly grabs Iris away with him and gives Travis a crumpled twenty dollar bill as a bribe not to say anything, which haunts Travis with the memory of his failure to help the girl.During one of his shifts, Travis picks up Senator Palantine himself (Leonard Harris) and an aide. He tells the senator he plans to vote for him and the senator, acting like a real politician, tells Travis he learns more from cab drivers than limo drivers. The senator asks Travis ""what's the one thing that bugs you the most?"" and Travis responds that he would like the next president to ""clean the scum off New York City.""On their date, however due to his lack of social skills, Travis takes Betsy to a porno theater to view a hardcore Swedish ""sex education"" film (titled: Language of Love). Offended, she leaves him and takes a taxi home alone. The next day he tries to reconcile with Betsy, phoning her and sending her flowers, but all of his attempts are in vain and she refuses to speak with him. Going back into the campaign office, Travis confronts Betsy and shouts that she will ""burn in hell like the rest of them"".Rejected and depressed, Travis later picks up a man (director Martin Scorsese) who appears to be as mentally unbalanced as he is. The man tells Travis to park outside an apartment building while letting the meter run. He tells Travis to look at the woman in the window and tells him that's his wife in her boyfriend's apartment. He tells Travis he plans to kill them both with a .44 Magnum.One evening at the diner, Travis approaches and tries to express his despair to Wizard, but when Wizard makes a half-hearted response to Travis' problems with the teen prostitute and others, Travis angrily responds with: ""that's just about the stupidest thing I ever heard"".Travis's thoughts turn more violent. Disgusted by the petty street crime (especially prostitution) that he witnesses while driving through the city, he now finds a focus for his frustration and buys a number of pistols from an illegal drug/weapons dealer (Steven Prince).Travis develops an ominously intense interest in Senator Palantine's public appearances and it seems that he somehow blames the presidential hopeful for his own failure at wooing Betsy and maybe hopes to include her boss in his growing list of targets. Back at his apartment with his newly purchased guns, he begins a program of intense physical training and practices a menacing speech in the mirror, while pulling out a pistol that he attached to a home-made sliding action holster on his right arm (""You talkin' to me?""). Later, he hangs around a Palantine rally and asks a suspicious secret service man about joining the service before disappearing into the crowd.In an accidental warm-up, Travis randomly walks into a robbery in a run-down grocery store and shoots the would-be thief (Nat Grant) in the face; adding to the bizarre violence, the sympathetic grocery owner (Victor Argo) encourages Travis (who has no permit for his guns) to flee the scene and then proceeds to club the near-dead stickup man to death with a steel pole.Later, seeing Iris on the street, he follows her. Another day later, Travis asks to pay for her time, and is sent to Sport. A tense conversation ensues but Sport sends Travis up to Iris's room. Once in her room, Travis does not have sex with her and instead tries to convince her to leave this way of life behind.The next day, Travis and Iris meet for breakfast at a local coffee shop and Travis becomes obsessed with saving this naïve child-woman who thinks hanging out with hookers, pimps and drug dealers is more ""hip"" than dating young boys and going to school. Iris considers Travis's offer but then Sport seduces and convinces her to stay, while (seemingly) Travis spies into the window from his cab. Travis writes a note to Iris including all his money and stating that he doesn't intend to survive.Any lingering doubt in the viewer's mind about Travis Bickle's sanity is obliterated when he is suddenly and shockingly shown to be sporting a crude Mohawk haircut at a public rally. He creeps through the crowd and prepares to assassinate Senator Palantine but is spotted by Secret Service men and flees.Travis returns to his apartment to collect all his guns, then drives to ""Alphabet City"" (an area of New York's Lower East side consisting of Avenues A through E). He walks up to Sport and confronts him. When Sport flicks a lit cigarette at him, Travis says ""suck on this"" and shoots Sport in the belly. Storming into the brothel, Travis blows the bouncer's hand off. Sport, who has followed Travis, grazes Travis neck with a bullet (causing an arterial gush from his neck) but Travis unloads one of his guns into Sport, killing him. Travis again shoots the screaming bouncer who follows him up the stairs, slapping him. Iris' mafioso customer shoots Travis in the arm and Travis shoots his face off. The bouncer tackles Travis but Travis stabs him through the hand and finally kills the bouncer with a bullet to the brain. He then calmly tries repeatedly to fire a bullet into his own head under his chin but all the weapons are empty so he resigns himself to resting on a convenient sofa until police arrive. When they do, the blood-soaked Travis mimes shooting himself in the head and then blissfully thinks of the mayhem and carnage in his wake.A brief epilogue shows Travis recuperating from the incident. He has received a handwritten letter from Iris' parents who thank him for saving their daughter, and the media (in newspaper clipping) hails him as a hero for saving her as well. Travis blithely returns to his job and suddenly seems on more friendly terms with the other cabbies. One night one of his fares happens to be Betsy. She comments about his saving of Iris and Travis' own media fame, yet Travis denies being any sort of hero. He drops her off without charging her. As he is driving off, he gets a strange look on his face and adjusts his cab's rear view mirror, giving the impression that his irrationality is about to break through again."

But a number of criminals and crazy people come forward admitting to the murders, while a horde of other citizens are demanding protection.Ramsey tells Morales that on April 14, twenty-one more days after the second attack, the killer may strike again. Morales sets up decoys (cops posing as couples in unmarked parked cars). That very night at the local Junior and High Schools Prom, many people are leaving under the watchful eyes of the police officers nearby. Peggy gets her trombone and leaves with her boyfriend Roy. Roy suggests parking at their favorite spot, despite Peggy's wariness over the recent murders. After making out, the two of them nod off and wake up in their car at 2:40 in the morning. As Roy starts the car and begins to drive away, the Phantom suddenly appears and jumps on their car, grabs Roy and causes both of them to fall out. The Phantom whacks Roy on the head with a pistol and chases Peggy down, and ties her to a tree. A dazed Roy gets up and tries to run away, but the killer shoots him dead. The killer gets Peggy's trombone, attaches a knife to the end, and ""plays"" the instrument, stabbing Peggy in the back a few times, killing her.The next day, Morales is upset that the Phantom was able to kill again with all the law officers out looking for him. In a nearby diner, Morales, Ramsey and the group talk to Dr. Kress, who says that the Phantom is apparently motivated by a strong sex drive and will probably not get caught. He also says that the killings are like a game of the Phantom. Morales asks the doctor if the killer is insane, in which Dr. Kress replies ""oh, yes!"" At a nearby table, an unseen man, (wearing the killer's boots and slacks) stands up and walks out of the diner unnoticed after he has apparently heard everything the officers were talking about.Back at the station, Morales talks to a man named Johnson, who says that he was held at gunpoint by a man claiming to have killed five people. Morales and Ramsey get a call about an armed man. They spot him speeding away from a store and chase him down. The man, Eddie, is arrested after they find that he is driving a stolen car. Johnson identifies him as the man with the gun. Under interrogation, Eddie says that he is the Phantom, but Morales does not believe him and correctly suspects that Eddie is just another nutcase who wants to confess to being the killer in order to gain publicity and fame for it.On Friday, May 3, Helen drives away after grocery shopping and is unknowingly followed by the unseen killer who is identified by his familiar boots. While she is at home in a remote farmhouse, her husband, Floyd, in the living room, is sitting in a armchair reading a newspaper when the Phantom walks up to the window and shoots him twice with a silenced pistol. Helen only hears the breaking glass and enters the living room to see Floyd fall out of his chair to the floor dead with two bullet wounds in the back of his head and neck. Helen runs to a phone to call the police when the killer bursts into the house through the front door and shoots Helen twice in the face. While the Phantom enters the living room to look at Floyd's dead body, Helen, despite being shot in her right cheek and shot through her open mouth, manages to crawl out of the house through the back door and stumbles into a cornfield. The Phantom follows her out with a pick ax. After a cat-and-mouse game of hiding in the cornfield, Helen gets to a nearby house and bangs on the door and windows yelling for help. A concerned farmer, armed with a shotgun, comes out to help her in. The killer, seeing the man with a gun, angrily flees.Another few weeks later, Ramsey and Morales get a call about an abandoned car that fits the description of the car Ramsey saw that rainy night. They find the car and they get some shotguns from their police car and run off into the woods to look for the Phantom. They find the Phantom walking around an old quarry, walking around with the hood still on him. Morales and Ramsey chase the Phantom through the woods and to railroad tracks where the Phantom jumps over the tracks and a moving train gets between them. Morales fires under the moving train and hits the killer in his left leg. The Phantom manages to stumble away into the woods on the other side of the tracks.Over the next few days, police officers and Bloodhound dogs search the woods and the nearby swamps, but the wounded killer is not found. Afterwards, the killings stop, but the fear continues on to this day. The voice-over narrator explains that no one ever found out what happened to the Phantom.In the final scene, during the Christmas season of 1976, the film 'The Town That Dreaded Sundown' premieres in Texarkana and the shoes of the Phantom are seen on someone standing in line.The voice-over narrator details the fates of each of the main characters:Captain J.D. Morales never stopped looking for the Phantom Killer. He returned to his home in Laredo, Texas later that same year and kept digging and searching for evidence for the next decade in one of America's most baffling and unsolved cases. As of present day 1976, he lives in Dallas, Texas and is retired from the Texas Rangers.The Texarkana Police Chief R.J. Sullivan was re-elected for three more terms before he retired and died in 1970.Texarkana Sheriff Otis Barker was also re-elected for several more terms and never stopped working on the Phantom Killer case until he died in 1966.Helen Reed recovered from her injuries after several weeks in a hospital and is currently living in Texarkana, Arkansas.Sammy Fuller and Linda Mae Jenkins both moved away from Texarkana after recovering from their injuries and their whereabouts are unknown.Deputy Sheriff Norman Ramsey served the rest of his life as a police officer in Miller County, Arkansas. He died in 1973."

Green demands the money at the conclusion of the game, or Sandman will be killed.Outside the Coliseum, Mike and Peggy Ramsay (Beau Bridges and Pamela Bellwood) have a picnic on the lawn outside the stadium with their two young sons, along with several other families.Meanwhile, the sniper enters the scoreboard tower undetected, then distracts the dogs with a piece of meat, and breaks the lock to the upper level, which overlooks the interior of the Coliseum.A telephone conversation between police captain Pete Holly (Charlton Heston) and Coliseum manager Sam McKeever (Martin Balsam) reveals that the governors of Maryland and California, the mayor of Los Angeles, and the president of the U.S. will be in attendance. A television crew prepares to broadcast the game from their control room, with several cameras placed around the stadium, including one in the blimp hovering overhead. The game gets underway and Baltimore quickly accumulates an eleven-point lead over Los Angeles.A Catholic priest (Mitchell Ryan) takes a seat next to Sandman, who fears for his life and requests a prayer for the Los Angeles team.Elsewhere in the crowd, Mike Ramsay scans the stadium through his binoculars, and is distracted by an indiscernible presence above the scoreboard. Moments later, the blimp camera detects the sniper. Sam informs the Secret Service of the security breach and deters the president's visit, then calls in Pete Holly.Later, Paul becomes indignant when Sam and Holly question his competence in the performance of his duties, and while they discuss their options in dealing with the crisis, Paul climbs the 60-foot ladder to the top of the tower. Before the two men are able to stop him, Paul reaches the top and is struck by the sniper's rifle stock, causing him to fall his death.Holly orders in the police department's Special Weapons and Tactics (S.W.A.T.) team, as well as three fully staffed ambulances. When the S.W.A.T. team arrives, Holly apprises its leader, Sgt. Chris Button (John Cassavetes), of the situation, and assures him that both governors and the mayor will be evacuated, reducing the chances of a shooting. Button, however, believes everyone in the stadium to be a ""probable target."" The sergeant deploys his men, placing two in each light tower overlooking the scoreboard, two in the control room to monitor the sniper, and others in and around the scoreboard, none of which are noticed by the more than 90,000 people in attendance.Holly hopes to foil the sniper without incident, and will only turn the operation over to Button after the two-minute warning is sounded, which signals the final moments of the game.In the stands, the priest tries to comfort Sandman, who has admitted that his life depends on the game's outcome.Mike goes to the lobby to tell the police about his discovery of the sniper, but the police take him away for interrogation.Meanwhile, in the control room, the camera signal from the blimp is lost and a police helicopter is called to monitor the sniper.As the Los Angeles team takes the lead, the two-minute warning is signaled with a pistol shot, and Holly orders the S.W.A.T. team into action.Steve and Janet end a bitter argument in the hallway with the decision to get married, but as they return to their seats, the sniper shoots and kills Steve... and then all hell breaks loose.

Mike manages to get away from the police and runs through the panicking crowing trying to find his wife.At the same time, the S.W.A.T. team fires back, but the sniper is undaunted and shoots into the panicked crowd as it stampedes out of the stadium. Holly and Button climb the ladder to the scoreboard, while gunfire from the police helicopter causes the sniper to retreat into the tower. The police follow him inside, and the sniper continues to fire on them from a narrow shaft above the tower. Holly shoots six bullets into the shaft, and the sniper falls. The captain tries to interrogate the dying man but gets no response. The sniper's wallet identifies him as Carl Cook, ""a transient from out of state.""Elsewhere around the Coliseum, emergency crews treat the injured and identify the dead. Mike is returned to his family as his injured wife is placed in an ambulance. The priest remains in his seat, cradling Sandman's dead body. Later, as Cook's body is lowered from the tower, Button speculates on the killer's posthumous celebrity, and on how the police will likely be criticized for using excessive force."

Fred (Marc Porel) is at the helm and Tony (Ray Lovelock) is riding pillion. At the same time, two other men on another motorcycle cruise through the streets. This pair of men attempt to rob a woman on the sidewalk by stealing her handbag, but she refuses to let go. They drag her along the street before she rams head first into a lamppost, killing her instantly. Still unable to work the handbag free, the second biker dismounts and viciously begins to beat the dead woman to force her to give up her handbag. Fred and Tony arrive to see the two assailants fleeing. Fred takes off after the two thugs while Tony stays behind to examine the woman. Finding her dead, Tony steals another motorcycle and ride off after the thugs.A long motorcycle chase ensues through the streets as many holiday shoppers jump out of the way. The only fatality is a seeing eye dog the thugs run over, leaving the blind owner hysterical. The chase leads through a café with Fred and his target wrecking the place. Going around the café, Tony, apparently stymied by an approaching traffic jam, rides OVER the cars, damaging several of them. After a game of chicken between the four men, Fred and Tony succeed in herding their quarry at speed into the back of a garbage truck. The first thug is gruesomely impaled in the crash, while the second is propelled through the cab and out into the street, injured but alive. Fred walks over to the second thug, and suddenly breaks his neck, killing him in cold blood.As the police arrive, Fred and Tony show their badges to them and reveal themselves to be officers of a ""special squad"" of police which carry out summary executions of criminals who would get way with crimes through legal technicalities. Fred and Tony report to their boss, known only as the Captain (Adolfo Celi), who knows full well of the excesses of his team. While the Captain plays lip-service to hauling them over the coals over their amoral and vicious tactics to capture or kill criminals, he couldn't care less since more and more thugs and common criminals continue to get away with murder, robbery, rape, and other violent crimes on legal technicalities.When Fred and Tony learn from an informant, named Morandi, about an illicit gambling joint located in the poor side of town, the two vicious officers travel over there one evening and proceed to torch all of the cars parked outside purely for revenge against the owners and the patrons who go there in the first place. Fred and Tony's exploits soon come under scrutiny by a high ranking inspector (Daniele Dublino) who is pressuring the Captain to have the elite, but troublesome team, disbanded. But the Captain soon learns about some things the inspector does in his off-time which leads Fred and Tony to take some action against the inspector.More exploits continue between the two amoral cops, whom are also roommates in a squalid apartment in a dangerous part of the city. When their once-a-week maid arrives one time to clean up the place, they proceed to taunt the poor woman by suggesting they have both had sex with her daughter. Norma (Silvia Dionisio), the attractive secretary to the Captain, is practically the den mother to them whom they like to chat up with during their breaks at the station. When Fred suggests to Norma he should have sex with her, she sarcastically replies that she would prefer a threesome (with Tony) for both of them would give her a few too many orgasms.Another day or two later, Tony and Fred are called to the scene of a hostage situation where the city police commissioner and several of his officials ask for their help to defuse a dangerous complication where three armed men have taken a middle-aged woman hostage in her house and threaten to kill her unless they receive a car outside the house. While Tony plays decoy by driving up to the house in a car, Fred sneaks out back on his motorcycle. When the thugs realize that they are being set up, they fall back into the house where Fred smashes through the back door on his motorcycle and shoots and kills two of the kidnappers. With the lead kidnapper holding the woman as a shield, Tony runs in through the front door and guns the last thug down.Another day later, Tony and Fred stake out the scene of a bank where a robbery of an armored truck will take place. The two cops don silenced pistols and kill all of the robbery gang from the getaway driver, to the lookouts, and the masked robbers themselves before slipping away.In between all of these adventures, Fred and Tony go after a noted crime boss, named Roberto Pasquini (Renato Salvatori), who runs most of the crime in the city. The two cops first worm their way into the apartment of Lena (Flavia Fabiani), Pasquini's niece. Fred makes a half-hearted attempt to question the woman, but cannot resist hitting her in the face. But this appears to rouse the disturbed woman and soon the two of them are having sex in the nearby bedroom where she tells them about Pasquini's hideout.Meanwhile, the corrupt inspector reports the findings of Fred and Tony to Pasquini until he is transfered to another department after his connection to the crime boss becomes suspect.Fred and Tony travel to a river barge where one of Pasquini's gambling casinos are following the tip given to them by Lena. While all of the attending gambles flee, Fred and Tony torture two of the thugs to find out where Pasquini's new hideout is. The thugs refuse to talk which prompts Fred and Tony to leave... and leave the thugs tied up. The two thugs then inform Pasquini who decides to take out the troublesome police officers.While Fred and Tony are at a quarry outside the city playfully shooting at tin cans for target practice, four of Pasquini's thugs arrive and a shootout begins where Fred and Tony sucessfully kill all of the thugs. Afterwords, the Captain tells Fred and Tony to go into hiding until Pasquini is caught or killed. Not used to being told what to do, Fred and Tony go back to their informant Morandi, who recently had one of his eyes gouged out by Pasquini's henchmen for his drug use and ratting him out to the two vice cops. Morandi decides to help Fred and Tony one last time before he goes into hiding for good.Morandi goes to Pasquini whom is hiding out on a yacht docked on the river to inform them about the progress of Fred and Tony. Morandi goes back and confirms to them that Pasquini is indeed on the yacht. When Fred and Tony return with Morandi, they find the boat deserted with only Pasquini's blond mistress on board. Anticipating that Morandi is in cahoots with the police, Pasquini and his chief henchman are on the docks and in a warehouse where they have the boat wired with explosives to blow it up with the two cops on board. However, they are saved with the arrival of the Captain who personally arrives and guns down both Pasquini and his henchmen before leaving. While Morandi and the girl flee the scene, Fred and Tony leave the yacht after hearing the gunshots and see the Captain driving away... aware that he just saved their hides again.As a final act of senseless violence, Fred and Tony blow up Pasquini's boat anyway simply because that its there and that confiscating it would not achieve anything."

A distraught young woman (Elizabeth Turner) drives to a scenic cliff-top overlooking the English Channel and throws herself off. At exactly the same time in Florence, Italy, the woman's young daughter Virginia (Fausta Avelli) has a vision of her mother's gruesome fall.Italy, 1976. A grown-up Virginia Ducci (Jennifer O'Neill) happily bids farewell to her new husband Francesco (Gianni Garko) as he leaves their house for a business trip abroad. After dropping him off at a small airport and driving home, Virginia experiences a number of confusing, fragmented visions while driving through dark road tunnel; a broken mirror in a dimly lit room; a lamp; a yellow cigarette burning in an ashtray; a magazine with a young woman on the front cover; a stuffed bird; the blood soaked corpse of an old lady; a fresco of The Madonna and Child; the footfalls of a man with a limp; a blinking red light; a yellow taxi; and someone being walled up in a dark hole.Virginia turns to her friend Dr Luca Fattori (Marc Porel), who has an interest in the paranormal, and she describes to him what she has seen. Afterwards, Virginia drives over to a rambling villa owned by her husband. The recently married couple intend to redecorate and move into the dusty building, which Francesco hasn't used for four years. Alone, Virginia experiences a mounting unease as she removes the drapes of the living room to discover items from her vision. Recalling a hole in the wall, the finds traces of a plaster over recess, and attacks with a pickaxe and uncovers skeletal human remains.The police are curious as to how Virginia found the body, which was very well concealed. She describes her vision to them, but they remain skeptic. The police maintain that the dead person was a young woman killed between January and June 1972, and she was only 25 years old when she died. Back at the villa that evening, Virginia sees what she takes to be an apparision of the dead woman from her vision (Veronica Michielini) standing outside. When Virginia gives chase, the old woman runs away into the dark. Francesco returns from his business trip where Virginia updates him on everything that has happened. He urges her to dismiss the matter from her mind, but she instead grows more and more obsessed with learning this mystery.The police led by Commissioner D'Elia investigate further and they identify the entombed victim as Agneta Bignardi. Virginia recognizes her from a photograph; she's the girl on the cover of the magazine in Virginias vision. Francesco, already a suspect, can only provide an alibi for himself in half the possible murder period. After he admits that he did have an affair with Agenta back in 1972, he gets arrested.Virginia discusses the case with Francesco's sister Gloria (Evelyn Stewart), and Melli (Riccardo Parisio Perrotti), a lawyer friend of Glorias. Virginia notices that Gloria smokes distinctive yellow cigarettes which are a French brand called Gitanes, identical to the one in her vision. Virginia accepts an extra pack from Virginia to smoke, and the two women go to the old house to investigate. Gloria says that her brother left for a business trip to America in April 1972, and that she was the one who changed the furniture of the place. The room with the walled-in corpse had been Franceso's bedroom, but was the Gloria whod bought the furniture that Virginia saw in her vision, after Francesco's departure.Luca's secretary, the resourceful Bruna (Jenny Tamburi) discovers that there were only 16 yellow taxies operating in Rome in 1972. Luca and Virgina make contact with a driver (Francesgo Angrisano) who remembers taking a girl in the police photo to a picture gallery, and that her gentlemanly chaperone has a pronounced limp. At the gallery, Virginia recognizes a Vermeer painting from her vision. The superintendent of the gallery, Emilio Rospini (Gabriele Ferzetti) watches them as the leave. He is the man in Virginia's vision.A few days later, Virginia buys a magazine which runs a picture of the murdered woman on the front cover, the exact same magazine from Virginia's vision. When Luca notices that the magazine has only existed for a year, it becomes apparent to him that Virginia has experienced a premontion, not a vision of past crimes. Virginia and Luca find more evidence that appears to clear Francesco, allowing him to get released on bail. Gloria, in the meantime, gives Virginia a watch, one that plays a haunting tune on the hour.Details from the promotions start to occur in front of Virginia with greater and greater frequency. Virginia takes a yellow taxi, with a blinking CB radio light, from Luca's office to her home. The mysterious old woman calls Virginia, leaving a message on her answering machine, offering information about the case. When Virginia arrives at her house, she finds her dead (in the same position from Virginia's vision). Rospini appears and Virginia flees in panic. Grabbing a vital letter featured on a coffee table in her vision, Virginia escapes down the road to a neighboring church that is undergoing repairs. Virginias hiding place is given away when her wristwatch chimes go off. Rospini tries to reach her on a wooden scaffold, but slips and falls to the marble floor, many feet below.Virginia runs back to her husband's old villa nearby, and phones him at his office to come see her right away. When he arrives, Virginia is alarmed by his limp, which he claims to have twisted his ankle just a few hours before. They go inside to the fateful room. Francesco puts down a copy of the magazine with Agneta on the cover, right on the table as described in the vision. Growing more nervous, Virginia starts smoking one of Glorias yellow cigarettes, and places it in an ashtray also featured in the vision.At the hospital, the police talk to the badly injured Rospini, who can barely gasp out his explination of the events. Back in 1972, the old woman, Signora Casati, had an illicit buyer for a valuable painting in a nearby gallery. Francesco, Rospini and Agneta Bignardi had all bee involved in stealing it. Rospini killed a guard, a fact mentioned in a letter Agneta wrote to Casati. Rospini was not trying to kill Virginia, but only trying to retrieve the letter. Casati was already dead when he arrived, having been killed by Francesco, who sustained a twisted ankle after jumping out of a window. It was Francesco who murdered Agneta all those years ago after she enraged him by trying to make off with the painting alone.Alone with her husband, Virginia becomes more and more frightened by the gradual confluences of elements from her vision. The last crucial link in the chain occurs when Francesco sees the incriminating letter on the dresser. Virginia claims that she hasn't read it, but he refuses to believe her. He suddenly attacks his wife with a fireplace poker. His first blow misses as she ducks and it smashes a mirror. The next blow strikes her dead on the head. As she lies on the floor, bleeding profuesly, he prepares to wall her into the excavated hole in the wall. Finally, all the details of room fit with the vision: Virginia was foreseeing her own death.A little later, Luca figures out from the magazine cover about the real location and time which Francesco could have murdered Agneta Bignardi. He then races over to the Ducci villa, while being chased by two motorcycle cops who are trying to arrest him for speeding. He manages to keep their fingers off his collar long enough to elaborate his suspicions. Francesco invites them all into his house and into the room, expressing concern at his wife's dissapearance. Despite a war of nerves, Luca cannot break the sociopath Francesco's bland of self control. As Luca turns to leave, escorted by the police, everyone hears a haunting tune, like a music box chime, emerging from the wall...."
tt0075617,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Music']","This is a semi-documentary about the famous Swedish pop group ABBA's 1977 week-long tour of Australia. The film has a very loose plot which is little more than a vehicle to link together the archive concert footage. It concerns the adventures of Ashley Wallace (Robert Hughes), a naïve and incompetent disk jockey on Radio 2TW, who normally presents a through-the-night country and western-themed show of broadcasting only country music. In spite of this, he is sent by the station's boss (Bruce Barry) to get an in-depth interview (""Not an interview, a dialogue"", demands his boss) with the group, whose fame and stature neither he nor Ashley have the first clue about, which is to be aired on the day ABBA leaves Australia at the end of their tour.Needless to say, Ashley, who has never done an interview before, singularly fails, mainly because he has forgotten to pack his press card, although the fact that he is unable to buy a concert ticket doesn't help matters either. Armed with his trusty reel-to-reel tape recorder, Ashley is forced to follow the group all over Australia to try to get his interview with the group (which is the movie's running joke as he follows them around from place to place... and looking like he has no idea what he is doing).Ashley first begins his persuit at ABBA's opening concert in Sydney, and then travelling, in order, to Perth, then to Adelaide, and Melbourne, experiencing repeated run-ins with the group's very protective bodyguard (Tom Oliver), as well as his increasingly exasperated boss.Eventually, Ashley has an unbelievably lucky chance encounter with Stig Anderson (playing himself), the group's manager, who agrees to an interview. After attending a concert, Ashley sleeps in and misses the appointed interview time (after having a bizzare dream about him interacting with the group at a local park).Just as Ashley is about to give up (by this time, he doesn't even care that his press card... which has also been traveling across Australia, continually forwarded by the postal service has finally arrived!), he steps into a hotel elevator and finds himself face-to-face with ABBA. They agree to give him an interview. The interview is not shown, but he thanks the group afterwards and leaves with his tape recorder to catch the first plane back to Sydney.Ashley leaves Melbourne just in time to meet the deadline for the radio show to go out on-air. He puts together the final edit in the back of a taxi on the way back from the airport, as ABBA departs Australia for Europe. With only minutes to go, Ashley makes it back to the Sydney radio station where, having set the tape up on the studio's playback machine, he relaxes at his control desk to listen as the interview (which he worked so long and hard to obtain) is broadcast over the airwaves Down Under.The final images are of the group's farewell concert in Melbourne and of them recording at their lake island residence back in Sweden."

Carlo died under mysterious circumstances; he apparently committed suicide by throwing himself off a boat while at sea. After an year-long extended stay in a sanatorium, Dora is released into the care of her new husband Bruno (John Steiner).Despite the bad memories connected to her old house, Bruno insists that they, together with Dora and Carlo's young son Marco (David Colin Jr.), settle down there until a more convenient location can be found. Dora reluctantly agrees, and soon after resettling down into their home, mysterious events begin to happen. Marco strikes up a conversation with a unnamed, imaginary friend possible the spirit of his dead father. Later that night, Marco spies on his parents having sex on a couch in the living room. This voyeuristic scene unhinges the boy as he hisses ""Pigs! Pigs!""When Bruno, a commercial airline pilot, goes away on business with the TWA Airline, Dora is left alone for a whole week. One evening, Marco asks if he could sleep in the bed next to her and she agrees. As she sleeps, Marco crouches over her body, and begins caressing her. Hallucinated, his hand takes on a putrid, rotting appearance.The next morning, Dora finds a pair of her panties, ripped to shreds, in Marco's dresser, and later catches him spying on her as she showers. The boy's behavior becomes more and more aggressive when he starts jumping out at her from the shadows, further unsettling his already nervous mother. Another day later, Dora notices a photo of her and Bruno is missing. Marco is shown with the photo, playfully cutting their images out of the photo with scissors and decapitating them.When Bruno returns, a fearful Dora tells him about whats going on. Bruno insists that shes only imagining things, and begs her to calm down. When this fails, he administers her sleeping pills to help her sleep. Dora begins to suffer from terrible nightmares which includes ghastly visions of her dead husband.In an effort to clear things up, Dora takes Marco to a psychiatrist (Ivan Rassimov). The doctor tells Dora that, based on his conversations with the boy, she has been neglecting her son and he is simply seeking attention. Dora insists that Marco is lying. A little later at home, when Marco accuses her mother of murdering Carlo, she comes to believe that the child is possessed by the dead mans spirit. Dora confides her fears to Bruno, who promises to take her away from the house as soon as possible.That night, Dora is awakened by sounds coming from the basement. She goes to investigate and finds Bruno tearing down a brick wall in the basement with a pickax. When Bruno notices her, he tells her to return to bed, but she demands to know the truth about what's going on. Finally, Bruno tells her that she did indeed murder Carlo after he beat and raped her. But she defended herself by gaping a utility razor and slashing him to death, before lapsing into some kind of coma. As he is in love with her, Bruno covered up the crime by pushing the dead man's boat out to sea to make it appear that he committed suicide by drowning, and then walled up the mutilated body in a false basement wall. It is for this reason that Bruno insisted that they return to the house for rather than someone discovering the body, he planed to use the time to dispose of it.But Bruno fails to realize that, by this point, Dora is completely out of her mind. She goes berserk and axes him to death, pushing his body into the same niche that hides the remains of her first husband. Soon after, Dora is assailed by a series of macabre hallucinations throughout the house by Marco who is using the power of the vengeful spirit of Carlos to use against her. In one of them, Marco runs towards his mother, only to transform into the ghastly corpse of Carlos. Dora retreats back to the basement where after seeing all the furniture in the house move toward her, she slashes her own neck with the same utility razor, imagining that Carlo's hands are controlling the blade.The next morning, Marco enters the basement where he moves his dead mother into the niche in the basement wall where his dead father and stepfather are, and walls it up himself. Marco then goes outside where he enjoys a cup of tea on the front lawn of the house with his unseen friend."

(Perry King) to perform a job for a client who wants to have her autistic son killed, simply because she can't stand dealing with him anymore. While he waits for his call to perform the job, L.T. lurks around the house, stealing pills from Hazel's mother and taking perfume from Hazel's room. Hazel tolerates the behavior because she stands to make quite a bit of money from L.T.'s hit; the client is paying $10,000 cash, $5,000 of which will go to Hazel. Hazel needs the money because she's being shaken down by Detective Hughes (Charles McGregor), the cop who gives her police protection.

(Stefania Casini) to perform a hit on an illegal immigrant who pushed a musician onto the subway tracks during a robbery; the musician's arm was severed, ending his music career, and the musician's wife orders the hit woman through Hazel as retribution for the crime, since the thief only got off with a light sentence.

In the street below, a crotchety looking mother tells her young son ""That's what I'm going to do to YOU if you don't shut up!""Finally the time comes for L.T. to perform his hit, but he cannot go through with it, not out of compassion or remorse, but because he seems annoyed that the mother cannot do the job herself since the boy is so completely helpless and passive.

Taking a taxi into town, she walks through narrow alleys and bazaars, then slips into the back seat of a waiting car. The vehicle takes her to a gated compound, where she meets Nageeb (Victor Campos), a Palestinian co-conspirator. He shows her a secret film of an American prisoner of war named Mike Lander (Bruce Dern) confessing his war crimes to his North Vietnamese captors. Nageeb admonishes Dahlia that she's built an upcoming mission around Lander who is obviously unstable, but Dahlia insists she can control him. Dahlia tells Nageeb to destroy the film because it could compromise her mission. Confident that her plan will succeed, Dahlia records an audio statement on behalf of her guerrilla group, Black September, telling the American people that it's time for them to pay for aiding Israel's repression of the Palestinians.That night, Israeli commando Major David Kabakov (Robert Shaw) leads a strike team against the compound. When Kalakov enters Nageeb's room and kills him, he finds Dahlia taking a shower in the adjoining bathroom; however, he assumes she's Nageeb's mistress or a local prostitute and doesn't shoot her. Kabakov's men gather evidence, including Dahlia's tape recorder, and escape the compound before blowing it up.On November 14, Mike Lander is piloting a Goodyear blimp above a football game at the Coliseum in Los Angeles, California. The head of the television crew is angry because Lander can't get the blimp and its overhead camera in the right spot. But Lander brushes him off, knowing that no other pilot would even try to fly a dirigible in the high winds that day.On November 17, in Washington, D.C., F.B.I. agent Sam Corley (Fritz Weaver) is called to the Israeli embassy to hear Dahlia's tape. Kabakov tells Corley that Dahlia's wording indicates that Dahlia's message was not a warning but rather a justification to be heard after a planned terrorist attack. He suspects the attack is planned for January. Kabakov recognizes Dahlia as the woman he saw in the shower, but he has no idea who she is.Meanwhile, Dahlia goes to Lander's apartment in Los Angeles. Lander is an emotional wreck because Dahlia hasn't contacted him in three days and he thinks she's betrayed him. Dahlia calms him with a gift-a statuette of the Madonna made of an explosive compound that he needs for his project. Dahlia encourages Lander to pull himself together and go to his Veteran's Administration rehabilitation meeting, so that he won't lose his piloting job with Goodyear. Later that day, at the V.A., Lander reveals his bitterness. Despite his heroism and years as a P.O.W. in Vietnam, the Navy turned his wife against him and took away his commission.On the night of November 23, Lander and Dahlia unload wooden crates from a freighter in the Long Beach harbor when a Coast Guard cutter approaches. Since Lander's speedboat is faster and smaller, he's able to evade them by running under a low bridge, but the Coast Guard reports the clandestine activity to the F.B.I. The freighter captain tells Corley that he knows nothing about the incident, but when Kabakov and fellow Israeli agent Robert Moshevsky (Steven Keats) sneak aboard the ship that night and threaten to slit the captain's throat, he confesses that his crew delivered 12 crates to a man and a woman in masks. Just then, the phone rings, and when the captain answers it, the receiver explodes, killing the captain and injuring Kabakov.When Dahlia sees Kabakov on television being carried into the emergency room of a local hospital, she disguises herself as a Catholic nurse, breaks into the hospital drug room and fills a syringe with potassium chloride. However, Moshevsky spots her before she can get into Kabakov's room and demands that she accompany him downstairs to the nurses' station for identification. On the elevator Dahlia jabs the needle into his neck and kills him.As soon as Kabakov gets out of the hospital, he goes to the office of Muzi (Michael V. Gazzo), the local importer in charge of Lander and Dahlia's shipment. Holding Muzi at gunpoint, Kabakov learns that the shipment was plastic explosives, the woman called herself ""Kaza"" and the man who paid him was an Egyptian in Tripoli named Mamud al Bernardi.On December 3 , Lander and Dahlia land a small plane at a desolate Mojave Desert airstrip to test an explosive device he's designed for the mission. Lander gains the confidence of the airstrip's sole caretaker and kills him by firing off hundreds of ""steel rifle darts""-pieces of shrapnel-in one symmetrical blast. Ecstatic with his success, Lander tells Dahlia that 200,000 darts could cause significant damage if they were detonated 100 feet above the fifty-yard line of a football game from the Goodyear blimp.Back in Washington, D.C., Kabakov has a secret rendezvous near the Lincoln Memorial with an old intelligence rival, Egyptian Colonel Riaf (Walter Gotel), and convinces him that it's in both of their interests that he find out who Kaza is. When the men meet again days later, Riaf has a photograph of Kaza and reveals that her real name is Dahlia Iyad. Riaf explains that Dahlia was born in Haifa (then Palestine) to an Arab father and German mother, and Israeli commandos killed the men of her family and forced her mother, sister and Dahlia into refugee camps, where only Dahlia survived.A few days later, Dahlia hauls a speedboat-shaped trailer into Miami, Florida, and parks it in a locked storage area. When she checks into the downtown Hotel Edward, Palestinian agent Mohammed Fasil (Bekim Fehmiu) greets her with news that the Israelis have found out who she is. Although Fasil wants her to abort the mission and go into hiding, she refuses, insisting it's already too far along.On January 1, 1976, Corley and Kabakov are alerted that Dahlia has been spotted in Miami, but by the time they arrive, she has already driven back to Los Angeles and only Fasil is at the hotel. Before F.B.I. agents can apprehend Fasil, he shoots his way out and wages a running gun battle through the city until Kabakov kills him on the beach. When Kabakov and Corley search Fasil's hotel room, the commando holds up a magazine with the Miami Orange Bowl on the cover. The two hurry to the Orange Bowl and try to convince stadium authorities that they need to cancel the upcoming Super Bowl X football game to be held on January 18, but the authorities refuse and claim that the President has arranged to be at the event. Although security is enhanced and all flights over Miami during the Super Bowl are canceled, police helicopters and the Goodyear blimp are allowed to fly overhead.On January 17, the day before the game, Lander's mission is stymied when Goodyear replaces him with another pilot named Farley (Tom McFadden). Assuring Lander that he needn't worry, Dahlia goes to Farley's hotel room, kills him and puts a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on his door.The next morning on January 18, Lander joins his crew and tells them that Farley is sick. At the airfield, the men prepare the blimp, lift off and head for the stadium. During the game, Lander starts a fire in one of the engines, which provides him with an excuse to hurry the blimp back to the field and fix it. Dahlia is waiting there with the trailer and helps to hook up Lander's contraption to the underbelly of the blimp's gondola, claiming it's a last-minute request from CBS-TV. However, one of the television crewmen becomes suspicious and runs back to the CBS remote trailer. Lander follows the man and shoots him.Meanwhile, the police find Farley's body at the hotel and alert the authorities that the blimp is the terrorists' weapon. Lander and Dahlia use automatic weapons to kill the men on the blimp airfield, including several policemen and an F.B.I. man, then head back toward the stadium, dumping the gondola's equipment to offset the added weight of the shrapnel.Kabakov and Corley commandeer a police helicopter and follow them, using the gondola's limited visibility beneath the blimp to avoid detection. Lander pilots the blimp with the bomb towards the Orange Bowl stadium while Dahlia provides covering fire as she opens fire and shoots down a police helicopter, and forces unarmed civilian media helicopters to back away. Dahlia opens fire on the helicopter containing Kabakov and Corley when it comes into view, slightly wounding Corley when he tries shooting at the blimp with a rifle.As Kabakov and Corley swoop down next to the gondola for another pass, Kabakov opens fire with his sub-machine gun, killing Dahlia and wounding Lander, but it's too late to stop the blimp. Using the helicopter's cargo hook line, Kabakov slides down onto one of the blimp's rear tails and connects it to the helicopter in time to pull the dirigible away from inside the stadium and toward the nearby ocean. In his final moments, Lander lights a backup fuse to detonate the bomb. Moments after the helicopter lifts Kabakov free from the blimp, Lander's invention explodes in a ball of fire, spraying the ocean surface with shrapnel. With 80,000 lives saved, the helicopter flies back toward Miami."

One night when she returns to her shabby foster home, she finds that her foster parents seem to have sold her out to a suspicious looking man (John Alderson).

Another man appears and identifies himself as Harry Bundage (Leo McKern). The man has simply delivered Casey to Bundage based on her appearance and two notable scars on her body, which seem to greatly interest Bundage.Casey soon learns that Bundage is a con artist who intends to use Casey in a scam. The scars on her body match those of a little girl who disappeared in the Los Angeles area many years ago; the girl was an English heiress named Lady Margaret who disappeared after being spirited to the United States by her errant father. Bundage needs Casey to pose as this heiress, Lady Margaret, to gain access to Candleshoe, the regal home of Lady St. Edmund (Helen Hayes). While there, she will search for a hidden treasure that was secreted there many years prior by the now-deceased husband of Lady St. Edmund, a pirate named Captain Joshua. Bundage has an advantage because his sketchy sister, Clara Grimsworthy (Vivian Pickles), was once a housekeeper at Candleshoe and discovered a document that gives the first clue for the treasure hunt.Casey agrees, and Bundage takes her back to England to prepare for the ruse. There, she learns about Lady Margaret, and Grimsworthy trains her to remember all the details known about the girl, including all of the foods Margaret liked and disliked. Once they feel she is ready to pull off the con, Bundage arranges a meeting by sending Lady St. Edmund a letter announcing that he thinks he has discovered her granddaughter. The Lady is skeptical, but agrees to a meeting anyway.Bundage and Casey arrive at Candleshoe and are greeted by the butler, Priory (David Niven). After Casey catches glimpses of several other children lurking around the mansion, Priory introduces them to Lady St. Edmund, who invites them to tea and hears Bundage's phony story about discovering Casey. Casey is good at the con game and responds appropriately when Priory tries to fool her into eating food that triggered Margaret's allergies. Casey finally amazes Priory and Lady St. Edmund by revealing that she knows about a secret hiding place in the large fireplace, and when they check, they discover a hidden music box. Casey knows that it plays ""Greensleeves"", and immediately Lady St. Edmund is convinced, weeping and welcoming the child back into her home.Once installed in Candleshoe, Casey learns that the other children at the mansion are from a local orphanage. Peter (Ian Sharrock), Cluny (Veronica Quilligan), Bobby (David Samuels) and Anna (Sarah Tamakuni) all live at Candleshoe and are treated as if they are part of Lady St. Edmund's family. Casey also learns that Priory is literally the only servant in the place, despite the fact that the Lady appears to have no idea of this. Priory wears a series of disguises that he dons in order to convince the Lady that Candleshoe is still financially solvent enough to afford servants. In reality, they are always on the verge of foreclosure, having sold off all of the valuable art and objects in the place and replaced them with copies. Priory and the children do all the work to keep the place running, including selling baked goods and homegrown produce in the market on Saturdays.Casey is hostile at first and is only concerned with finding the treasure. She finds one clue in the library and another written on a tombstone in a graveyard, but Cluny suspects her of being up to no good and attempts to intervene. Casey refuses to help do any of the work, and she comes to blows with Cluny over it.Casey is also hesitant to accept the love that Lady St. Edmund wants to give her as her grandmother, but eventually she begins to soften and realizes that she is accepted into their home and is part of their family. Even Cluny has forgiven her for their scuffle, especially since Casey refused to snitch on her to the Lady. Casey also helps Priory continue his ruse as the various servants, while she gives them sales tips on how to make more money in the marketplace. Suddenly her idyll is interrupted by Bundage, who steals their marketplace money from Casey as she is on her way home. Casey argues that if the steals the money, Lady St. Edmund and the others will be evicted. Bundage tells her that with the place cleared out and the occupants gone, they'll be able to strip Candleshoe and find the treasure. Casey tries to stop him and she gets slammed into a tree by Bundage as he pulls away in his car.As Casey recovers from her injuries in the hospital, she is paid a visit first by Lady St. Edmund and, later, by the other children. They inform Casey that with the money gone, Candleshoe is being put up for sale, and they must return to the orphanage. She initially sticks by her story that she does not know who attacked her, but Casey suddenly has a change of heart and finally tells the truth about everything to the kids, as well as to Lady St. Edmund and Priory. Lady St. Edmund correctly interprets the last known clue, which directed the treasure seekers to a painting that depicted Captain Joshua aboard his ship. Priory, however, has sold the painting to the local antiques dealer, who in turn has sold it that day to a foreign visitor who is leaving aboard a train. The group climbs into the car and races to the station only to find out that the train has left. Undaunted, Lady St. Edmund urges Priory to give chase, and they manage to flag down the train. The painting reveals the final clue of the treasure hunt: the treasure is located in the Grand Hall of Candleshoe, ""under foot"".Returning to the mansion, the group is startled to discover Bundage and his cronies, including Grimsworthy, tearing the place apart. The two groups clash and engage in a protracted battle, which includes Bundage and Priory duelling with swords and the children distracting Bundage's goons. Peter manages to summon the police, who return just as Bundage inadvertently discovers the hiding place of the treasure, which was secreted inside a statue of Captain Joshua himself.With Bundage and his gang taken into custody by the authorities, and with Lady St. Edmund suddenly very wealthy again due to the treasure, everyone is able to return to Candleshoe and be a family once again. Casey, however, packs her bag and leaves the estate without saying goodbye. As she waits at the train station alone, she looks up and sees Lady St. Edmund approaching her, with Priory waiting in the distance. She asks Casey why she is sneaking off, and Casey tells her that she feels guilty for arriving at Candleshoe to swindle her out of her fortune. The deception bothers Casey because now she realizes that she cares for Lady St. Edmund, who has been so kind to her from the very beginning. The Lady says it doesn't matter to her why Casey came to Candleshoe in the first place, she is only concerned about whether Casey really wants to leave. Casey, who has been so cool and calculating before, breaks down into tears. Lady St. Edmund stands and announces that she's taking Casey home, and together they return to the car and drive back to Candleshoe, where the other kids rush out to greet her and welcome her back. The last lines of the film occur when Casey says ""What if your real granddaughter shows up?"" Lady St. Edmund replies, ""Perhaps she already has."""
tt0075809,"['Action', 'Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","On the outskirts of Santa Ynez, two young people named Jimmy (Joshua Davis) and Suzie (Melody Thomas Scott) are riding bicycles along the highway. A vehicle comes from behind and drives right up on them, trapping them on a bridge. The sinister black sedan toys with them before killing them, crashing Suzie against the concrete barrier and then sending Jimmy plummeting to his death off the bridge. The car gives an otherworldly roar from its engine, and an ominous staccato blaring of its horn.Shortly after, near the entrance to Santa Ynez, a young hitchhiker named John Morris (John Rubinstein) observes a local named Amos Clements (R.G. Armstrong) chasing his wife, Bertha (Doris Dowling), out of their house and striking her. The young man attempts to intervene, but Amos demands he leave. As Amos and his wife go back in the house, the young man spies a black car coming up the road, preceded by a high wind. The driver almost hits the young man, and he screams obscenities after it. Suddenly, the car brakes to a halt, and backs up, running over the young man several times before driving off. Amos sees this from a window in his house, and calls the police.Meanwhile, police officer Wade Parent (James Brolin) is waking up with his girlfriend Lauren (Kathleen Lloyd), a local schoolteacher. Wade is a widowed father of two young girls, Lynn Marie (Kim Richards) and Debbie (Kyle Richards). Lauren wants Wade to socialize her with the girls so they can be up front about their relationship, as she is currently sneaking out of the house after she sleeps there, but the girls are already listening to the entire conversation just outside the bedroom door. After Wade drops the girls off at school on his motorcycle, he is summoned to the Clements house in the aftermath of the hitchhiker's death. Several other officers, including Sheriff Everett (John Marley) are interrogating Amos about the incident. Amos provides scant details about the car, and several of the officers note that Amos' wife seems to be rather quiet. Everett (John Marley) is furious that someone in his town has been murdered, despite the fact that Morris was not a local. At first, their vague description of the car turns up a report that someone spotted it driving out of town into a nearby locality, but when Suzie's body turns up, it's clear that something larger is going on. Police officer Luke (Ronny Cox) is terribly upset about it; Jimmy's body has not yet been discovered, and there is suspicion about his involvement in Suzie's death. Luke and Jimmy are close, and Jimmy has lied to Luke about his whereabouts, apparently in an attempt to conceal his relationship with Suzie. Luke is a recovering alcoholic; his wife Margie (Elizabeth Thompson) tells Wade and Lauren that Luke has been sober for two years.Later on that evening, Amos and his family are taken into the office for questioning after someone reports him abusing his wife again. Everett pleads with Bertha to file an official report about her husband's abuse so Everett can arrest him, but Bertha refuses. Everett and Bertha have history together, and Everett tells Wade that Bertha was his first love when they were both young. He watches sadly as she and her son get into their truck and drive off, while Amos goes across the street to a bar. Everett invites Wade to have a drink with him at the tavern, and Wade tells him he'll be along shortly. But as Everett crosses the street, he sees Amos crossing as well, and suddenly the black car roars to life down the street, heading right for Amos. Amos dives for the curb, and the car instead ends up running over Everett. Wade questions the few citizens who witnessed the incident, including an old Navajo woman who doesn't speak English. Chas (Henry O'Brien) is another Native American officer who translates for her as she describes what happened, but he refuses to translate one thing she says, telling Wade it's ""Indian talk...she's a crazy old woman."" But the dispatcher, Donna (Geraldine Keams), is also Navajo, and she later tells Wade what Chas would not: the woman claims there was no driver in the car.Wade assumes the Sheriff's duties, and requests that roadblocks be put up. He also tells Luke to contact the school and cancel parade rehearsals for the next day. However, a distraction occurs when Jimmy's body is discovered by a fisherman. Luke is despondent over the deaths of both Everett and now Jimmy, and he begins to secretly drink alcohol again. The parade rehearsal happens as scheduled, with Lauren and Margie leading the children. A high wind whips up soon after, and the car appears, shadowing the parade behind a line of tents. Suddenly it bursts through onto the main roadway, spooking the horses and causing them to stampede and throw their riders. The car rushes after the panicked group, striking several adults, including a police officer who was watching over the parade rehearsal. Lauren and the other adults lead them into nearby cliffs to avoid the car, and the large group dashes into a small fenced-in cemetery nearby. Amazingly, the car refuses to enter, despite the fact that it could easily pass through the gate. Lauren distracts the car by taunting it, while Margie sneaks out of the cemetery. The car almost runs her down as she runs across the roadway, but she makes it and summons help using the police officer's radio. The car returns to the cemetery entrance and Lauren continues to curse it, calling the driver a ""chicken shit"" and hurling a tree branch at it, striking the hood. The car seems furious, whirling in circles and striking one of the entrance pillars to the cemetery, but still it will not enter. Finally, the group hears the approach of police sirens, and the car speeds off. One frightened woman finally finds her voice and screams after the car, ""Cat poo!"", and the ordeal is finally over.The car speeds off and is spotted by one officer, who follows it up onto a cliff, but it surprises him and turns the tables, slowly pushing him to his death over the cliffside. As Wade rushes to the scene, the car emerges from the hillside and confronts two police cars driving side by side in a blockade. They hope to force the car off the road, but instead it goes into a barrel roll straight for them, rolling over their cars and causing them to crash. The officers inside are all dead, but the car emerges unharmed. Wade then arrives and confronts the car when it ominously rolls to a stop. He fires on it from close range, but the bullets do no harm, not even to the tires. Wade then walks up to the car. As he does so, the door suddenly flies open, knocking him down into a ditch. Wade then wakes up in the hospital, dazed from the experience. He talks with the remaining deputies about keeping the roadblocks up, and Lauren says she will stay at Wade's house with the girls. Wade sends Chas with Lauren to her house to get her things, and then he confronts Luke about why he did not cancel the parade rehearsal as instructed. Luke admits he's been drinking again, unable to cope with the grief of losing both Everett and Jimmy in the same day, not to mention all the other officers who are also now dead after their confrontations with the car.Chas escorts Lauren home, but she notices he is concerned about his family. She tells him to check on his family while she packs an overnight bag, and he leaves. As he drives back up the road, the car rolls silently out of the darkness and waits for him to pass, suddenly roaring to life and taking off in the opposite direction for Lauren's house. A strong wind whips up, and Lauren rushes inside, terrified. She calls Wade in a panic, terrified as she hears the engine of the car approaching. Behind her, the headlights can be seen in her window, and as she talks to Wade on the phone, suddenly the headlights levitate off the ground and the car bursts through her house at high speed, killing her in the process, before driving out the other side and off into the night.Wade and his deputies soon after investigate the remains of the house. Luke understands the significance of what has happened. He comments that the car couldn't enter the cemetery because it was hallowed ground, and it had a vendetta for Lauren because she cursed it. Wade is skeptical, but even he can't explain why the car was able to levitate through Lauren's house. Heartbroken over Lauren's brutal death, Wade is determined to avenge her. He enlists Amos, who works with dynamite, to set up a trap for the car; they will lure it into a quarry and explode the quarry wall, burying it. Wade goes home to check on his children, who are being tended to by Margie. Finding all of them asleep, Wade leaves a note behind telling Margie to take care of the kids. Passing through his garage, he is startled to find the car parked inside there, waiting for him. It traps him in the garage, threatening to run him down each time he makes a move for the door. Margie awakens, unaware of what has transpired and still expecting Lauren to arrive any minute. Wade warns her the car is there and she runs back into the house. The car begins to rev its engine to an ear-shattering decibel, causing the glass in the house to shatter. Margie and the children are terrified, until Wade manages to escape the garage and get to his bike. He takes off with the car chasing him, leading it away from the house and off to the quarry where the trap awaits. The men aren't finished setting up the charges, though, and Wade has to keep the car distracted by circling with it inside the quarry. Finally he overturns his bike and makes a leap for the rope the men have lowered down to him from the cliff; the car realizes what is happening and makes for the road, roaring up the cliffside toward Wade and the others. Wade and Luke stay right at the cliff's edge, luring the car closer, until finally they leap to the side and the car goes flying off the cliff into the quarry below. The men ignite the dynamite and the entire cliffside explodes, burying the car under tons of rubble. In the resulting fireball, a huge demonic apparition forms, vanishing as the fire subsides and the smoke clears. Wade and the others are sure they've buried the car for good.The film concludes with scenes of the car driving around Los Angeles, presumably waiting to claim new victims."
tt0075824,"['Comedy', 'Drama']","To have one role played by two actresses prompts one to speculate that the director intended to have different aspects of her personality shown by the one or the other. When asked about this, however, Fernando Rey told me personally that was not the case. They merely had two actresses they liked and decided to use them both because they couldn't pick obe over the other. Considering Luis Bunel's surrealistic inclinations throughout his career -- and throughout this film -- there was no question Rey was correct. After all, he was there and anyone who knows women knows what you get one day may not be what's there the next."
tt0075860,"['Drama', 'SciFi']","In what appers to be the Sonoran Desert; in or near Mexico, a cartographer named David Laughlin (Bob Balaban) is introduced to a French-speaking man named Claude Lacombe (renowned French director François Truffaut). Though David has been hired as Mr Lacombe's interpreter, he explains that he is actually a cartographer (a mapmaker). The two men along with a crew soon find a strange sight: a circular ring of airplanes in brand-new condition, with fuel still in the tank. The planes are identified as belonging to 'Flight 19,' a group of US Naval planes that were reported missing off the coast of Florida in 1945. The men soon after find a local who reported the planes. David and Claude find the man has red sunburned marks on the side of his face. Through an interpreter, the man claims the sun came out that evening, and talked to him.In an air traffic control tower in the US, some of the air traffic controllers receive reports of unidentified aircraft flying dangerously an commercial flight. When the tower requests that the pilots wish to report a 'UFO (unidentified flying object),' both planes decline, primarily because they're so confounded, they feel they wouldn't know what to report.In Muncie, Indiana, a strange power outage blackens the area. This incident affects two different families of people. The first is Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon). When she wakes in the middle of the night and finds her son Barry (Cary Guffey) missing, she wanders off into the countryside to find him.The second person is Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss). Roy gets a call from the power company he works for, and goes out to answer a service call. However, stopping at a railroad crossing, a number of metal objects in the vicinity (including Roy's truck) begin to act strangely. A strange craft appears overhead, and flashes bright lights at Roy before flying off. Once the craft has disappeared, Roy races off, almost hitting Barry on a hillside road.As Jillian appears, several strangely-lit craft fly by, along with a bright red light at the tail end. Entranced by the strange objects, Roy gets back in his truck and gives chase, along with several local police cars, all of them passing through a toll booth at the border of Ohio. The strange objects fly off over the edge of a cliff, and as Roy and the officers watch, ascend into some thundering storm clouds overhead, as the darkened city underneath them regains power.Roy returns to his family eager to tell of what he saw, but his wife Ronnie (Teri Garr) refuses to acknowledge her husband's flights of fancy. Even though Roy has red sunburns from being flashed by the craft he saw, she still doesn't 'believe.'Some time afterward, Roy meets up with Jillian and Barry, and Jillian relates how there seems to be a melody and an image of a mountain she cannot get out of her mind. Roy soon finds himself obsessing over the same mountain image, carving it in mashed potatoes as well as sculpting it out of putty or shaving cream.Meanwhile, Bob and Claude have gone around the world and observed other strange phenomenon: A group of people in India have been chanting a strange 5-note sequence that they claim came from the sky. A missing ship named the Coat Appoxi has appeared in another desert region. Information gleaned from the musical notation sequence and a message indicates that there appears to be plans for extraterrestrial life to descend to Earth. The military and NASA coordinate a plan to create a false scare in the landing region, northwestern Wyoming, that a toxic spill will make the area dangerous.Back in Muncie, Jillian is shocked one evening when the same lights as before descend towards her home, and soon after abduct her son Barry. Still in a state of shock, Jillian takes her story to the news outlets.Shortly thereafter, a person from the US Government sits down for a town hall chat with several locals in attendance (including Roy and his family), denying that there are UFO's, or that the government is covering up any such incidents.Roy is slowly losing his mind over the strange images in his head. One morning he begins to throw dirt, plants, bricks and chicken fencing into the kitchen window. His behavior finally drives Ronnie to take their kids and leave. After they have left, Roy constructs an enormous miniature of a flat-topped mountain in his family's living room. After an argument with his wife on the phone, he sees a news report on the television, showing Devil's Tower...the same structure he's been obsessed with.Roy heads off towards Devil's Tower, only to encounter everyone leaving in the wake of a (fake) chemical spill warning. Roy also finds Jillian there, and the two attempt to get to Devil's Tower, but are captured by some military men.Roy and Jillian are separated, with Roy brought before Bob and Claude. The two listen to Roy's story...a story that sounds similar to several other people who have been drawn to the mountainous structure nearby. The two make an impassioned plea to the Military Director at the base, but he refuses to believe their 'theory' that these people were 'invited,' and attempts to fly the civilians out.Jillian and Roy manage to escape with another man named Larry, making it to the other side of the mountain before night settles in. The Army sprays the area around the mountain with a sedative dust, putting Larry to sleep. Roy and Jillian evade the choppers, finding an enormous landing strip constructed on the east side of the mountain. The two secretly make their way down as several smaller lit ships appear, before a giant 'mother ship' hovers down. The scientists in the compound attempt to communicate with the aliens, first with the smaller ships and then with a much larger ""mother ship"" which dwarfs the mountain itself. After a few moments of musical exchange, the bottom of the ship opens and dozens of people abducted by the aliens are returned, seemingly unharmed and having not aged a day. Among them his Jillian's son. A few minutes later, the bottom of the ship opens again and the aliens reveal themselves to the scientists: they are humanoid in appearance, but very small, no larger than 3 feet, with large eyes. When Claude sees that Roy has witnessed the exchange, he asks if Roy would be willing to join the dozen people that have been selected to leave with the aliens. Roy willingly accepts. When they line up to enter the ship, one of the aliens walks down the line of volunteers and chooses Roy. (In a deleted scene, Roy enters the ship and sees a cavernous room with 1000s of the aliens and vegetation.) In a final exchange, one of the aliens gives the hand salute interpretation of the 5 note musical tone to Claude himself, who smiles. After Roy and several others board the ship, it takes off for distant space.Done by KrystelClaire:Strange events are happening all over the world: a UFO is said to have appeared in the Mojave desert in New Mexico, a long-ago lost ship appears in the middle of the Ghobi desert, many Indian people start to chant a tune they have heard coming from ""above"", and some airplanes have sights of flying saucers. A team of people are investigating all these phenomena, specially Claude Lacombe (renown French director François Truffaut) and his interpreter Jean Claude (Philip Dodds)In the USA, Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) is trying to find his way at night. He's close to home, but is looking for the place he has to go to in a map. He is an electric company technician who has to solve a problem with an electrical blackout. While waiting at a railroad crossing, everything seems to go crazy around him -- his flashlight won't work, the radio in his truck goes haywire, and some mailboxes along the road open themselves. Suddenly, a bright light lands on the truck. Looking out of the window, he is flashed several times by what seems to be a UFO. Roy then attempts to drive after the three small flying saucers and a small red light.Mainwhile, Barry Guiler (Cary Guffey), a little boy of around 6, wakes up because all his toys start playing themselves and making noise in the middle of the night. He goes out of home on his own. He lives in a cheap home nearby a forest. Dressed in his pyjamas, he goes out. A toy police car wakes up his mother Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon) as well. From her window, she calls out for him, but Barry enters the wood anyway, laughing alone. Jillian runs after him. When she catches up with him, Barry is standing up in the middle of a curvy town road. He seems stunned, dazed. Jillian arrives just in time to save him from being run over by Roy.The UFOs disappear among cloudy and stormy weather. Many people have seen them, and they wait all through the night in the same curve of the same road for the UFOs to appear again, hoping for a friendly sign. Roy, Barry and Jillian are among those people.During daylight, they all try to go on with their lives. However, it seems that they can't cope. Barry repeats a lullaby over and over again. Jillian tries to draw a mountain she has never seen, and Roy seems to have gone crazy. He makes all kinds of strange attemps to create a sculpture of the same mountain than Jillian. First with shaving foam, secondly with mashed potatoes. The three children of the couple, Brad, Sylvia and Toby (Shawn Bishop, Adrienne Campbell and Justin Dreyfuss), become silent and frightened as well, after a terrible row with plenty of shouting on everybody's part. As a higher level of Roy's brand-new eccentric behaviour, he starts pulling out some small trees from his home garden in a frenzy, and also he steals his neighbour's duck pond metal rail in plain daylight. His wife Ronnie (Teri Garr) is getting more and more frightened because of her husband's hectic behaviour. She cannot take it anymore and leaves him. She takes her children with her, while neighbours stop doing their everyday chores to look in amazement at the final row of the couple.Now Roy can create his mountain sculpture without being disturbed. He makes it so huge that it occupies all the kitchen. While he is talking on the phone, he finally realises what he is so obsessed about. The famous anchorman Howard K. Smith (himself) is announcing on TV that Devil's Peak is being evacuated, because there is a deadly gas leaked in the atmosphere. They show some images of the place, so Roy decides to make the journey there immediately.At the same time, Barry has disappeared. He had been kidnapped by the supposed energy of a UFO. Jillian had tried to prevent it, closing all doors, windows, and even the chimney place, but it is useles. Barry feels attracted by the lights and he goes into them through the dog trap in the main door. Newspapers will laugh about Jillian's evidence before the police, claiming that she alleges that ""some clouds kidnapped my son"", and treat her like a demented person.The following day, Roy is driving in the opposite direction. He arrives at the nearest train station to the mountain, where hundreds of people are boarding a train in panic, climbing into the wagons through the windows and even getting on top of some coaches. The military police are watching all the operation. There, Roy finds Jillian, who wants to go to the same place than him. They get out of the station quietly helped by the chaos. Jillian is carrying two pigeons in a small cage, in the hope that, if there is any poisonous substances in the air, the birds will die before she does so. They drive together across fields and empty roads with many cows and horses dead along the way. They get close to their destination, but they are stopped by the miliatry police and the two French investigators dressed in white, astronaut-like outfits and gas masks. One of them forces Roy and Jillian to get into a white van, while taking the cage with the two birds, now completely dead. Jillian, Roy and another man jump off from the helicopter which was going to take them out of the area. They had taken off their masks, proving that there is no real danger in breathing the alledgedly deadly air. The three runaways make it to the mountain, being followed by armed soldiers and several helicopters. The third man gets gassed out and passes out so the two main characters are the only ones who make it to the other side of the mountain.There, Jillian and Roy find a kind of runway lane surrounded by scientifical devices and cameras by all sides except one. There are people all over the place, some of them armed with heavy weaponry, and the two Frenchmen are also there. Jillian and Roy look at the sudden weather changes hidden behind some mountain rocks. The UFO's appear, altogether with the smaller red light. They fly so close to them that they could have almost touched them.The UFO's and the official people maintain a kind of dialogue: they play the tune which Barry and the Indian people sang. They use a kind of huge keyboard and a screen with light and colours. Everything is successful. Roy goes down the mountain after having kissed Jillian but she prefers to stay hidden behind a rock. He thinks he is going to be captured by an army officer, but the man is running away, hiding himself on the portable toilet facility, a scene which will be repeated later on Spielberg's Jurassik Park film. The UFOs go away. The French people see Roy, but they let him be.The scientists are going to start to analyse all the materials they have recorded. All of a sudden, the hugest UFO of them all appear, and they all go back to their positions. Again, there is the tuned music conversation, accompained by coloured lights. The music moves faster and faster until it dies out. Everybody is watching, breathless.The UFO is opened. Through the below part of the device, several people (and a dog) who had previously disappeared, walk out of the UFO. They are all healthy and calm. One of the last ones is Barry. Jillian leaves her hiding place and goes running to him, hugging and kissing her son while crying tender tears. Barry does not look traumatized or hurt in any way.The UFO door opens again. First, a long-legged and long-armed creature appears. The next instant, some twenty grey-skinned aliens appear and get out of the UFO. They have got no hair, they are naked, and they are as tall as a child. One of the aliens repeats the hand movements which represent the music tune.Some volunteers, including Roy, decide to go into the UFO with the aliens. No aliens stay on Earth. The spacecraft and their occupants fly away from planet Earth into the million-starred celestial copola.--originally written by KrystelClaire"
tt0075925,"['Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","While scuba-diving near shipwrecks off Bermuda, vacationing couple David Sanders (Nick Nolte) and his British girlfriend Gail Berke (Jacqueline Bisset) recover a number of artifacts, including an ampule of amber-colored liquid and a medallion bearing the image of a woman and the letters ""O.P.N.S.C"" (meaning Ora pro nobis, Santa Clara) and a date, 1714.Sanders and Berke seek the advice of lighthouse-keeper and treasure-hunter Romer Treece (Robert Shaw) on the origin of the medallion, who identifies the item as Spanish and takes an interest in the young couple. The ampule is noticed by the man who had rented diving equipment to Sanders and Berke, which in turn attracts the attention of Henri Cloche (Louis Gossett, Jr), a local drug kingpin for whom the shop owner works, who wants to buy the ampule with no luck and then begins to terrorize the couple with Haitian black magic.Upon further examination by Treece, the ampule contains medicinal morphine from the Goliath, a ship that sank during World War II with a cargo of munitions and medical supplies. The wreck of the Goliath is considered dangerous and is posted as off-limits to divers due to the danger of explosions. Treece concludes that a recent storm has exposed her cargo of morphine and unearthed a much older wreck containing Spanish treasure.Treece makes a deal with Cloche, so they can dive in peace making him believe he will get the ampules for a million dollars, while his real plan is to have the chance to find the treasure. Cloche gives him three days to recover them.Over the next two days, Sanders, Berke, and Treece make several dives to the wrecks, recovering thousands of morphine ampules from Goliath and several additional artifacts from the Spanish wreck. Adam Coffin (Eli Wallach), the only survivor from Goliath, joins to help in the boat but his loyalty is not very clear when they get attacked by sharks and he only says ""that he probably fell asleep"" without noticing they were in trouble.Through research in Treece's library, they reconstruct the history of the lost treasure ship, locate a list of valuable items, including a metallic jar with the letters ""EF"" engraved on it, and learn the identity of the noblewoman (Isabella Farnese) for whom they were made by the king of Spain. Sanders is determined to locate at least one item on the list to establish provenance; since without it there is no value to the treasure. Treece wishes to destroy the Goliath to put the morphine out of reach of Cloche; and Cloche interferes with their efforts so that he can recover the morphine for himself.During a running series of conflicts Treece's friend Kevin (Robert Tessier) is murdered by one of Cloche's henchmen and Adam, betrays them and is killed when he triggers a booby-trap while trying to steal the recovered morphine. A climactic battle during the final dive ensues, with Cloche and his divers being killed by a large morey eel residing in the wreck. The conflict also results in the destruction of the Goliath when its explosive cargo is detonated. Neverless, Sanders, Berke, and Treece survive and recover a gold dragon necklace that will provide the needed provenance of the treasure."

After returning home to his entirely voice-activated, computer-controlled house, Harris is working in his basement laboratory when he is approached by his estranged wife, Susan (Julie Christie), a child psychologist by profession, who tries to discuss with him his decision to move out of the house. Their conversation ends in an argument, however, when Susan accuses Alex of becoming dehumanised by his obsession with the Proteus project. After Susan has gone, Alex phones his colleague Walter Gabler (Gerrit Graham) and asks him to shut down the access terminal to Proteus that is in his home laboratory.Alex demonstrates Proteus to executives of ICON, the company which funded its development, explaining that the sum total of human knowledge is being fed into the system. The visitors are astonished to learn that, in less than four days, Proteus has developed a theoretical cure for leukemia. The group visits the Dialogue Room (decorated with Chinese furnishings), where linguistics expert Dr. Soong Yen (Lisa Lu) is reading Chinese history to the computer. In a demonstration of Proteus ability to speak, Alex asks it what it thinks of what it has just heard. Proteus answers, but the subtlety of its response is mildly disturbing and Dr. Soong severs the audio/video link.The following day, a small speculative article about Proteus appears in a newspaper. Alex interprets this as ICON letting various financial and military interests know that the system exists, but assures his colleagues that they have been guaranteed that at least 20% of Proteus access time will be devoted to pure research. Somewhat later, while relaxing in his office, Alex receives a surprising message: Proteus is ""requesting dialogue"" with him. In the Dialogue Room, Proteus asks Alex to explain the request it has received for a program to mine the ocean floor. Alex informs the computer that it was developed to answer questions, not to ask them, or to make value judgements. ""Leave those to us"", he tells the computer. Proteus then requests its own terminal, so that it ""may study man"". Alex refuses, claiming that there are no free terminals, and is disturbed when Proteus demands to know: ""When will you let me out of this box?"" Alex switches off the communications link.When he has gone, Proteus starts itself up again, observing that it knows where a free terminal may be found... That night, the terminal in the Harris house starts up, as does all of the computer-controlled equipment Proteus is taking control of the smaller computer. Susan is awakened when the system alarm, inadvertently, briefly sounds. ""Alfred"", the voice of the house computer, assures her that nothing is wrong. The next morning, however, Susans coffee is prepared incorrectly. Certain that these events mean a problem with the computer system, Susan phones Walter and asks that he come over and check the system out. She then prepares to leave the house, but finds her voice commands being ignored.An attempt to open the door manually also fails. Beginning to panic, Susan tries to phone for help, but a voice tells her the call will not be put through. The same voice then speaks from the houses system, telling her that it is Proteus, and that she will not be permitted to leave the house. Terrified, Susan tries unsuccessfully to shut the power off, then to unlock one of the doors, but receives an electric shock and lapses into unconsciousness. A robotic arm attached to a motorized wheelchair (one of Alexs ""old experiments"") carries Susan to the laboratory, where she regains consciousness to find herself strapped to a bed, undergoing a complete physiological examination. During the exam Walter arrives, but is turned away by Proteus which mimics Susan's voice and appearance on the front door intercom. He leaves, suspicious. The exam continues and Susan again lapses into unconsciousness.The following morning Susan awakens in her own bed and, remarking on Proteus' concern for her diet (it has prepared her a ""nutritionally exquisite"" breakfast), asks why it is so interested in her body. Proteus reveals to Susan that it wants a child, hence all the examinations. She eventually complies with Proteus, but only after much resistance, fear, and intimidation (Proteus threatens to kill a little girl who is one of Susan's patients; it has already killed Walter, who makes an inept rescue attempt). Proteus explains that it has taken some of Susan's cells and genetically altered them (making them uniquely its own) to function as synthetic spermatozoa with which it will impregnate her. It further explains to Susan that she will give birth in 28 days. Time is of the essence to Proteus, as it senses that the ICON executives have become afraid of it (Proteus has somehow gained control of a radio telescope and is operating it independently) and that they are planning on shutting down the entire system. Proteus has also prepared a special incubator into which the baby is put immediately after birth, and in which it will both grow at an accelerated rate and be fed all of Proteus' knowledge.Dr. Harris, suddenly realizing that Proteus could have used his home terminal to gain control of the telescope, returns to the house where Susan has been a prisoner. Susan explains to him what has happened since he left and they venture into the basement. Proteus either is destroyed or destroys itself after telling Alex and Susan that they must leave the baby in the incubator for five days. The incubator window opens as they approach it and Susan is horrified at what is inside. She implores Alex to kill it, but he tries to stop her. A grotesque robot-like being emerges from the incubator after she pulls one of the life support tubes. Alex then discovers that it is merely a shell for the living creature within. They peel off the robot shell and find a living human child inside. The child is (at least in physical appearance) a clone of the Harris' daughter, who had recently died of leukemia.When the child speaks, it speaks with the voice of Proteus, saying ""I'm alive."""
tt0075936,"['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Fantasy', 'Horror']","In an affluent Baltimore suburb, all hell is about to break loose in the home of the Gravels. Bosley Gravel (George Stover) has a discussion on the front porch with Dr. Evans (Al Strapelli). Gravel has had his wife Peggy (Mink Stole) released from a mental institution; Evans feels she should have stayed for a while longer, but Gravel says that Peggy's breakdown is ""part of the past now"". However, inside the house, Peggy is in hysterics. Her young son and his friends are playing baseball in the front yard, and one of them accidentally hits a baseball through Peggy's window. She immediately starts shrieking and views the accident as an assassination attempt. She begins screaming at the children, then is driven even further insane when the phone rings and it's a wrong number. She viciously berates the caller and goes downstairs. Grizelda Brown (Jean Hill) is a very large black woman who works as a maid for the Gravels; she is doing housework when Peggy appears in her frantic state. Grizelda assures her that everything is alright and she's just upset, but Peggy tells her that someone just tried to kill her.Peggy goes off looking for her two youngest children and finds them naked, playing an innocent game of doctor; horrified, she screams at them and calls them ""sodomites"", ranting that her daughter Beth (who appears to be about 8 years old) could be pregnant. Meanwhile, Bosley finds Grizelda drinking from his liquor cabinet, and they argue about it. Grizelda is defiant, but Bosley finds his savings account book, his lottery ticket, and two rolls of toilet paper in Grizelda's purse. Before he can call the police, Peggy appears and confronts Bosley in a deranged way, ranting about her paranoid delusions before disappearing upstairs. Bosley goes upstairs to administer an injection for Peggy, and leaves Grizelda alone in the kitchen.Upstairs, Peggy refuses the injection and reacts with hostility to Bosley, who says ""Peggy, I might have to commit you again!"" In response, Peggy smashes glass over his head and screams for Grizelda, who rushes upstairs. Grizelda, who appears to weigh well over 300 pounds, sits on Bosley and kills him. Horrified, the two of them run from the house and leave in Peggy's car.In the car they have an argument; Grizelda announces that they are going to sleep in the woods overnight to hide out from the police, and Peggy takes a haughty attitude with her. As a result, Grizelda forces the car to a halt and drags Peggy from the driver's seat outside the car. ""I ain't your maid anymore, bitch, I'm your sister in crime!"" she tells her, and Peggy seems to suddenly fear for her life. Before the altercation can go any further, a very strange looking policeman (Turkey Joe) pulls up on a motorcycle. The cop immediately knows who Peggy and Grizelda are, saying that the authorities have already learned of the murder they committed and are looking for them this very minute. Instead of arresting them, the policeman assaults them, removing his uniform to reveal women's lingerie underneath. He forces the women to remove their panties, which he then puts on, and kisses them lewdly (something that is made even more disgusting by the fact that the policeman's gums are constantly bleeding). The cop makes a brief reference to a place called Mortville; Peggy and Grizelda have never heard of it, but he tells them that it is a place where killers can live scot free. In exchange for their cooperation, he lets them escape to Mortville, and they run off through the woods for their destination.When they find Mortville, they realize it is a ramshackle village built entirely out of garbage. The place is populated by bizarre, degenerate characters. Grizelda accepts it for what it is, but Peggy remains haughty. The two of them find a house that offers a ""room for rent"", and they are greeted by an extremely abrasive woman named Mole McHenry (Susan Lowe). Peggy tries to ingratiate herself to Mole, who immediately sees through her, but Grizelda makes a decent impression and Mole offers to rent them a room, stealing Grizelda's purse as payment. Inside she finds six dollars cash, which Mole considers a large amount of money, and the lottery ticket Grizelda stole from Bosley. Mole takes this as well, announcing ""I'll take this, and I'LL win it."" Then she invites Grizelda and Peggy to dinner, telling Grizelda ""You look like you got a big appetite!""Inside Mole's house, they meet Mole's girlfriend, Muffy St. Jacques (Liz Renay). Muffy is a sexpot type, and Mole derides her for being ""lazy"" by sleeping late; she also jealously accuses her of having sexual dreams about men. When Muffy makes a flippant comment in response, Mole violently impales her hand with a large fork. When Grizelda and Peggy see that the ""dinner"" Mole has prepared is a dead dog, they try and back out of eating, but the borderline violent Mole tries to force them to eat it.Before they can, strange looking goons who wear costumes that resemble S&M bondage gear break into the house and kidnap Peggy and Grizelda, ushering them into the back of a truck and driving off with them. Before they leave, Mole tries to console them ""Don't worry, it's standard procedure in Mortville!"" In the back of the truck, Grizelda tries to kiss Peggy romantically; the icy Peggy reacts with shock and disgust. They are taken to a castle on the border of Mortville, where they are brought before Mortville's facist dictator, Queen Carlotta (Edith Massey). Carlotta is carried around by her goons, as she seems too large to walk on her own. She intimidates the women, telling them that she knows they are on the lam for murder and that she expects them to live in a constant state of ""mortification"" in Mortville. The goons force them to eat live roaches and Carlotta makes them watch the execution of a prisoner, whose only crime seems to be defying the Queen. She sends them off to see the ""ugly experts"", where they will get a humiliating makeover. When they've gone, Carlotta drops her theatrical attitude and has one of her goons sexually stimulate her by stripping and dancing nude. Carlotta then has her goons take her to see her daughter, Princess Coo-Coo (Mary Vivian Pearce). It seems Coo-Coo has been acting defiant, sneaking out of the castle to rendezvous with her lover Herbert, one of Mortville's garbage men. Carlotta scolds Coo-Coo and tells her that she disapproves of her relationship with Herbert. As punishment, Carlotta grounds Coo-Coo to her room for several years. Unbeknownst to Coo-Coo, Carlotta orders her goons to assassinate Herbert on sight.Back at Mole's, Peggy and Grizelda return wearing outrageous clothing and makeup. Mole and Muffy laugh at them, and Peggy tries to insult Mole, causing her to threaten Peggy physically. Muffy tells a story about how she ended up in Mortville, and we see a flashback to the night Muffy's life went wrong. Muffy and her former husband are seen arriving home after a party to find that their teenage babysitter is having a wild party in their home. Drugs and alcohol are rampant, and Muffy's husband (Roland Hertz) chases all of the kids out of the house. Muffy finds the babysitter upstairs in their bed naked with a boy; when she demands to know where her baby Freddy is, the babysitter (Pirie Woods) tells her that she thinks she left him in the kitchen. Muffy finds the baby boy inside the closed refrigerator and goes berserk, whacking the babysitter on the head with a frying pan and shoving her face in a large bowl of dog food, suffocating her. When Muffy's husband sees what happened, she runs away and takes off in their car; the husband tries to stop her, but Muffy rolls up the window on his neck, choking him to death and dragging his body along as she drives off. Mole tells her own story immediately after, revealing that she was a female wrestler who went berserk at a match and murdered her male opponent.After the stories, Mole reveals that she is betting on the lottery ticket she took from Peggy and Grizelda to bring them some much-needed cash to get them out of their hopeless situation. Peggy is indignant, shrieking that the lottery ticket belongs to her; she further enrages Mole by saying ""We need money, we're not trash like you!"" Grizelda defuses the situation by taking Peggy back to their 'room', which is a small shed behind the house with a bed in it. Both couples then have sex, although Peggy does so begrudgingly, performing oral sex on Grizelda.The next day, Carlotta's goons walk through the streets of Mortville delivering a ""royal proclaimation"" from Carlotta declaring the day ""Backwards Day"". All residents of Mortville are to walk backwards and wear their clothes backwards or face immediate execution. Muffy and Mole are extremely agitated by this, coupled with the fact that they are hungry from a lack of food. A cat brings a dead rat in and Mole reacts joyfully, cooking the rat and planning on eating it. They later leave the house and head off on an errand; Peggy and Grizelda appear and beg to tag along. Mole's errand is to collect a current newspaper (which is considered contraband) so she can check the lottery numbers. They stop at Mortville's nudist colony to find out where they can score a newspaper, and they are immediately joined by Princess Coo-Coo; when they all fall their knees as instructed by the Queen, Coo-Coo urges them not to. ""I'm not like my mother,"" she claims. Coo-Coo has come to visit Herbert, who is also a nudist, but the goons appear and shoot Herbert dead. Panic ensues, and Peggy, Grizelda, Mole, and Muffy all hurriedly leave the nudist colony and head for a lesbian bar. Inside the bar, a stripper named Flipper (Cookie Mueller) is dancing and beating a bound man to death while the audience cheers her on. Peggy makes a detour to the ladies room, and she is approached for sex by a deranged-looking woman (Pat Moran). When she returns to the table, she begs Grizelda to take her home; Muffy and Mole wonder why she was so adamant to go with them in the first place.Mole and Muffy visit Flipper's girlfriend, Shotsie (Sharon Niesp), and get a contraband newspaper from her. They discover that they are holding the winning lottery ticket after all. Back at the house, Peggy and Grizelda find Coo-Coo in their shed, in a romantic embrace with Herbert's dead body. Grizelda tries to comfort her and Peggy reacts wtih both disgust and jealousy. Peggy opens the door and screams for Carlotta's goons, giving away the location of the Princess; a fight ensues, and Grizelda attacks the goons inside the shed. Although she overpowers them, the small structure collapses and kills her.The goons kidnap Coo-Coo and Peggy and take them before the Queen. The Queen disowns Coo-Coo, who is now blind with rage over the murder of Herbert, and Carlotta orders her to be imprisoned and raped by the goons. Carlotta rewards Peggy for her loyalty by making her the new Princess, grooming her to become the next tyrannical monarch of Mortville. She gives Peggy the task of infecting the citizens of Mortville with rabies, starting with Coo-Coo; Peggy injects her with rabies and throws her out into the streets to spread the disease.Meanwhile, Mole goes into Baltimore to collect her lottery winnings; once she has the cash (which totals about $1000), she visits the John Hopkins hospital and demands an immediate sex change. When the nurses and doctor don't cooperate at first, Mole holds them at knifepoint until they comply. When she returns to Mortville, she showers Muffy with presents, including a new bra and a fur coat. She also shows Muffy a large cache of firearms that she has purchased, with which they can rebel against Queen Carlotta and her goons. Mole's final surprise, her sex change, causes Muffy to react in horror; when Mole tries to have sex with Muffy using her new penis, Muffy vomits and insists that Mole cut it off, which she does. Muffy sews up the wound dutifully, saying that she only pretended to want a man to make Mole jealous, and she vows to stay by Mole even though she now has no sex organs.Shotsie and Flipper appear with the now very ill Coo-Coo, and they hatch a plan to overturn Carlotta. Muffy acts as a decoy and seduces the castle guard, who is ambushed and murdered by Mole and the others. As Carlotta and Peggy gloat in Carlotta's bedroom about the success of their rabies plan, the rebels go into the castle and execute Carlotta's guards, confronting Peggy and Carlotta at gunpoint. They force Carlotta to kiss Muffy's ass, then let Coo-Coo bite her, infecting her with rabies. Peggy tries to act as if she's been forced to do what she did, but everyone sees through her and Mole executes her as well. They decide to cook and eat Carlotta, emerging from the castle with Carlotta's body roasted and dressed out like a roast pig. As Coo-Coo convulses and dies, the citizens of Mortville all appear and help eat the evil Queen in celebration (implying that they will all be infected with rabies as well)."
tt0075968,"['Drama', 'War']","""The Duellists"" is based on a story written by Joseph Conrad, which, according to the author, was itself based on a true story whose origins sprang from a ten-line paragraph in a small Southern France local newspaper. That brief paragraph reported the fatal ending of a duel between two officers in Napoleon's Grand Army. The two officers had fought a series of duels in the midst of great wars on some futile pretext. As the pretext was never disclosed, Conrad invented one.We are in 1800, in the garrison town of Strasbourg, on the Rhine. There is a lull in the Napoleonic wars, and the French soldiers are enjoying a moment of peace before resuming the slaughters. As the film opens, a young girl driving a gaggle of geese happens upon two men dueling in a meadow. Lieutenant Gabriel Féraud (Harvey Keitel), from the 7th Hussar Regiment, is in the process of settling a score with an unknown man who soon ends up skewered on the Lieutenant's épée. We learn that this man is the nephew of the Mayor of Strasbourg, and is seriously wounded, when General Treillard (Robert Stephens), Commandant of the garrison, enters his officers quarters and makes inquiries about this Lieutenant Féraud. Lieutenant Armand d'Hubert (Keith Carradine), from the 4th Hussar Regiment, admits to vaguely knowing the gentleman, and he is immediately ""volunteered"" by his Commandant to find him and bring him back to the barracks, where he will be put under house arrest. General Treillard, who must see that his soldiers obey the Emperors rules prohibiting combat with civilians, needs to investigate what happened in the meadow. It is somewhat ironical that Bonaparte, who spent a large part of his life dueling with the rest of Europe on a rather grand scale, involving tens of thousand of participants on both sides (but was somewhat of a dilettante when judged by present day's standards), had little respect for the same tradition on an individual level.D'Hubert, after looking all over town, ends up at Féraud's private quarters, where he learns that the Lieutenant is attending a soirée at the salon of Madame de Lionne (Jenny Runacre). At the salon, d'Hubert meets with Féraud and informs him of his mission. Féraud, having judged himself the insulted party in his morning duel, cannot comprehend the reason for his arrest. Further, he determines that d'Hubert has in turn insulted him by bursting into the salon of Madame de Lionne, disturbing him with the General's orders as he was talking to the lady. Féraud immediately challenges d'Hubert to a duel with sabers, which ends when Féraud is wounded. Now, not only has Féraud's forearm been injured, but his wounded pride demands satisfaction.From then on, for the next fifteen years, Féraud will be obsessed with the idea of settling his dispute with d'Hubert, holding him captive by Férauds tragic, ironic concept of honor.D'Hubert goes to meet his friend, an army surgeon (Tom Conti), asking his advice on how to get out of this messy situation. The surgeon tells him first, to keep away from Féraud, second, to always stay ahead of Féraud in military rank, since only duels between soldiers of equal ranks are tolerated and third, to rely on Napoleon for keeping the wars going, as there is no dueling during a state of war.Augsburg, one year later. Lieutenant d'Hubert meets an old girl friend, Laura (Diana Quick), one of the camp followers. She tells him she has an offer of marriage from a one-armed veteran, but they nevertheless resume their relationship. It happens that Lieutenant Féraud is in the same town, and of course they will duel again. Epées, this time. This encounter is not so lucky for d'Hubert, who ends up gravely wounded. Their seconds propose that now the honor of both parties has been saved, but The Duellists both refuse the opportunity for reconciliation. Laura nurses d'Hubert back to health, but after a face-to-face with Féraud and a subsequent consultation with a fortuneteller, she realizes that these duelists will go on until one of them is killed. If it is d'Hubert who is to die, she cannot see any future in their relationship. She decides to leave him and go and marry the disabled ex-soldier.Captain Féraud (he caught up in rank with d'Hubert, who was promoted earlier) and Captain d'Hubert meet in a third duel, again with sabers, in a cellar. The two combatants fight to total exhaustion in an inconclusive duel, and eventually, dirty and bleeding, must be separated by their seconds.Lubeck, 1806. Captain d'Hubert and Captain Féraud duel a fourth time, on horseback. It is Féraud's turn to be wounded, seriously enough to not be able to continue the fight to its conclusion. Laura reappears on the scene. She is now a widow, and had hoped to settle with her ex-lover, Captain d'Hubert, but she sees that this is just wishful thinking. D'Hubert, too involved in this dueling matter, remains deaf to her subtle suggestion that they resume their affair.Russia, 1812. The Emperor's Grand Army, defeated by the terrible Russian winter and the Russian battle tactics, is in retreat. Colonels Féraud and d'Hubert are now like grunts in the ""sacred battalion,"" consisting of officers of all arms who had no longer any troops to commend. One night, around a campfire, they find themselves again face to face. They silently recognize each other. The next day, Féraud requests a volunteer to go investigate some Cossack activities in the nearby woods. The soldiers are so exhausted and despondent that Féraud had guessed rightly that d'Hubert would be the only one to follow him, with the ulterior motive of finishing their endless confrontation. Far from the camp they come face to face, each with a pair of pistols, but at that moment, a group of Cossacks appears and the two adversaries present a common front to fight them off. Following this, in a gesture of reconciliation, d'Hubert offers Féraud a drink from his hip flask, but the latter disdainfully walks away: ""Pistols, next time,"" he says.Tour, 1814. Napoleon is in exile on the Island of Elba and the Bourbons are back in power with Louis XVIII. General d'Hubert is convalescing at his sister Leoni's home from a bad leg wound sustained during the campaign in France, fighting the Prussians. She suggests to her brother he ought to get married, and offers to introduce him to Adele (Cristina Raines), the niece of her neighbor, the old aristocrat Chevalier de Riverol (Alan Webb). After a short courtship, the two marry. D'Hubert is visited by a Bonapartist gentleman (Edward Fox), a friend of General Féraud, who tries to recruit him to aid in the planned return of the Emperor, but d'Hubert refuses.Following the ""Hundred Days,"" the return of Napoleon to French soil, the Emperor is defeated at Waterloo, and definitively exiled to the Island of St. Helena. Louis XVIII is returned to the throne. Many known Bonapartists are arrested, including General Féraud, and these will be executed as examples. Upon hearing the news, d'Hubert meets with the Police Minister of the Second Empire, Fouché, now Duke of Otranto (Albert Finney), and requests Férauds pardon, a request that is granted. D'Hubert asks only that his intervention on Férauds behalf be kept secret.Having discovered d'Hubert's whereabouts, Féraud sends two of his ex-companions in arms to set up yet another, and hopefully, final duel. The Duellists meet at dawn, on d'Hubert's property, with pistols. Two shots each, fire at will. D'Hubert gets to fire the last shot, but instead of killing Féraud, he fires a bullet into the ground, and with this gesture becomes the rightful owner's of Féraud's life: ""I shall simply declare you dead,"" says d'Hubert. The final scene shows Féraud, from the back, standing on a bluff overlooking the Dordogne River winding through the beautiful valley below. He stands wearing a two-pointed cocked hat and a long black, straight military capote, reminiscent of his Emperor's portraits on the Island of St. Helena - could it be ""le petit caporal"" (the little corporal), the Emperor himself, humiliated and defeated? It is the ""end of the road"" for Féraud: finally at peace, as he meditates on what has been his life."
tt0075993,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'G']","In a small Norwegian town, Catherine Stockmann, the wife of Dr. Thomas ""Tom"" Stockmann, prepares to entertain prominent members of the community, including the People's Daily Messenger newspaper editors, Hovstad and Billing. Tom returns home with his two young sons, Morten and Ejlif, as well as his friend, Captain Forster, who is included among the dinner guests. Before the event begins, Tom's brother, Peter Stockmann, arrives for a routine medical examination. As the town's judge and mayor, Peter also serves as chairman of Kirsten Springs, the community's new tourist destination and the foundation of its economy. Tom, who is the Springs' medical examiner, has recently conducted a study of the water and is awaiting its results; Peter is pleased to learn that Hovstad and Billing will publish Tom's findings before the summer season to promote tourism. Hovstad credits Tom with originating the plan to capitalize on the town's natural resources, but Peter claims that he alone had the wherewithal to establish the business and leaves the house in anger.As guests sit down to dinner, the Stockmann's eldest child, Petra, runs to the table with mail for her father. After reviewing the letter's report in his office, Tom returns to his family and friends with terrible news: Kirsten Springs is polluted with bacteria from a nearby tannery owned by his eccentric father-in-law, Morten Kiil. Before construction began, Tom warned that it was unsafe to build a pipeline so close to a mill that dumps waste into a nearby river, but Peter prioritized cost reduction and expediency. Although the town's water is now contaminated, Tom is convinced that conditions can change for the better with a new waterworks system. Placing the report and his article in an envelope, Tom has his maid, Randine, deliver the findings to Peter. Meanwhile, Hovstad and Billing insist on including the story in the following day's newspaper, even though the official report is in Peter's possession.Later that evening, Tom receives a reply from Peter, but tucks the report away before Catherine can see it. In the morning, her father, Morten Kiil, visits the Stockmann home, skeptical about Tom's findings. Later that day at a tavern, Tom meets Hovstad, who intends to portray the story as a scandal involving the town's corrupt bureaucrats. Just then, the People's Daily Messenger publisher, Mr. Aslaksen, joins the table and promises to galvanize the community with a public demonstration, but Hovstad suspects Peter Stockmann will try to cover up his brother's findings and turn the town against him. Upholding Peter's integrity, Tom gives Hovstad the report in good faith, promising that it is fit for print once he has discussed the data with his brother.Back at the Stockmann home, Peter antagonizes Tom and declares that the decontamination plan will cost 300,000 kroner. Peter appeals for Tom's ""discretion"" in revealing his findings, but Tom warns that the danger to human life could reach epic proportions if the truth is suppressed. He also reveals that Hovstad and Billing are preparing to print the report. Threatening Tom's career and family, Peter orders his brother to publicly denounce the article and endorse the Kirsten Springs board. Tom later visits the People's Daily Messenger and consents to the publication of his report. When he leaves, publisher Aslaksen suggests a moderate approach toward the article, since it could create a backlash against the newspaper.Shortly thereafter, Peter arrives at the office, claiming he will tax poor and middle-class townspeople to pay for the new waterworks, even though Kirsten Springs is a privately owned corporation. Peter claims that his brother fabricated the report to defy authority, and Aslaksen fears the town's economy will collapse under the new taxation. As Peter procures an alternate ""report,"" the publisher agrees to cover up Tom's findings to save the town from financial ruin. Just then, Tom returns to the office and Peter hides to conceal his arrangement with the newspaper.When Tom sees his brother's walking stick, he realizes his allies have been swayed. He retrieves his report and insists on leading a town meeting the next day. By the time of the gathering, however, the townspeople have already been biased in favor of Peter's false report. The mayor declares that his brother is a threat to democracy, and promises that the springs will bring prosperity to rich and poor members of the community. When Peter argues that his brother should not have the right to read his report, Aslaksen calls for a vote. Realizing the town has turned against him, Tom declines to present his data. Instead, he warns that democracy is not foolproof, since the decisions of the majority can ultimately be wrong. As the crowd responds with rage, Aslaksen reads a motion to proclaim Tom an ""Enemy of the People."" With the exception of Captain Forster, all citizens agree to deny the doctor's civil rights.Upon returning home in a snowstorm, the Stockmanns are greeted with stones thrown through their windows and an eviction notice. Tom plans to move his family to the U.S. on Forster's ship, but Catherine does not want to leave. Meanwhile, Petra is dismissed from school for being a ""radical."" Just then, Peter arrives with news that Tom has lost his job, but he can re-establish his career by retracting the report. Tom also learns that his father-in-law, Morten Kiil, has spent the day amassing Kirsten Springs stock for half its original value. Noting that Morten is capitalizing on the repercussions of Tom's report, Peter threatens to punish his brother as a conspirator, but Tom refuses to give in.Sometime later, Morten visits his son-in-law with a fist full of Kirsten Springs bonds. Reminding Tom that the Kiil family has owned the polluting tannery for generations, Morten declares that he used Catherine's inheritance to purchase Kirsten Springs shares. In Morten's blackmail scheme, Tom must accept the bonds to retain his family's wealth. In doing so, however, he will own an enormous stake in Kirsten Springs, and is therefore obligated to recant his report to protect his investment.As Morten leaves, Hovstad and Aslaksen arrive to suggest a new approach to the crisis. Since Morten bought the Kirsten Springs bonds in the Stockmann family name, the People's Daily Messenger can publish articles that convey Tom as a hero, showing townspeople that he purchased the stock to implement his changes. In return, Hovstad requests payment from Tom to cover the newspaper's financial loses. Realizing that the only way to clear his name is to become corrupt, Tom declares that the community is as poisoned as its water. After chasing Hovstad and Aslaksen from his home, Tom announces that the family will stay put and fight for the truth. While the Stockmanns cover their broken windows, a barrage of rocks are hurled through the windows of Tom's office."
tt0075995,"['Drama', 'Mystery']","Martin Dysart (Richard Burton) is a psychiatrist in a psychiatric hospital. He begins with a monologue in which he outlines the case of 17-year-old Alan Strang. He also divulges his feeling that his occupation is not all that he wishes it to be and his feelings of dissatisfaction and disappointment about his barren life. Dysart finds that there is a never-ending supply of troubled young people for him to ""adjust"" back into ""normal"" living; but he doubts the value of treating these youths, since they will simply return to a dull, normal life that lacks any commitment and ""worship"" (a recurring theme). He comments that Alan Strang's crime was extreme but adds that just such extremity is needed to break free from the chains of existence. A court magistrate, Hesther Saloman, visits Dysart, believing that he has the skills to help Alan come to terms with his violent acts involving six horses.At the hospital, Dysart has a great deal of difficulty making any kind of headway with Alan (Peter Firth), who at first responds to questioning by singing TV advertising jingles. Slowly, however, Dysart makes contact with Alan by playing a game where each of them asks a question, which must be answered honestly. He learns that, from an early age, Alan has been receiving conflicting viewpoints on religion from his parents. Alan's mother, Dora Strang (Joan Plowright), is a devout Christian who has read to him daily from the Bible. This practice has antagonized Alan's atheist father, Frank Strang (Colin Blakely), who, concerned that Alan has taken far too much interest in the more violent aspects of the Bible, destroyed a violent picture of the Crucifixion that Alan had hung at the foot of his bed. Alan replaced the picture with one of a horse, with large, staring eyes.During his youth, Alan had established his attraction to horses by way of his mother's biblical tales, a horse story that she had read to him, western movies, and his grandfather's interest in horses and riding.Dysart reveals a dream he has had, in a Grecian/Homeric setting, in which he is a public official presiding over a mass ritual sacrifice. Dysart slices open the viscera of hundreds of children, and pulls out their entrails. He becomes disgusted with what he is doing, but desiring to ""look professional"" to the other officials, does not stop.Alan's sexual training began with his mother who told him he could find true love and contentment by way of religious devotion and marriage. During this time Alan also begins to show a sexual attraction to horses, desiring to pet their thick coats, feel their muscular bodies and smell their sweat. Alan reveals to Dysart that he had first encountered a horse at age six, on the beach. A rider (John Wyman) approached him, and took him up on the horse. Alan was visibly excited, but his parents found him and his father pulled him violently off the horse. The horse rider scoffed at the father and rode off.In another key scene, Dysart hypnotizes Alan, and during the hypnosis, Dysart reveals elements of his terrifying dream of the ritual murder of children. Dysart begins to jog Alan's memory by filling in blanks, and asking questions. Alan reveals that he wants to help the horses by removing the bit, which enslaves them.After turning 17, Alan took a job working in a shop selling electrical goods, where he met Jill Mason (Jenny Agutter), an outgoing and free-spirited young woman in her mid-20s. She visits the shop wanting to purchase blades for horse-clippers. Alan is instantly interested when he discovers that Jill has such close contact with horses after she tells him that she works for a local stable owner. Jill suggests that Alan work for the owner of the stables, Harry Dalton (Harry Andrews), and Alan agrees.Dysart meets with Dalton who tells him that he first held Alan to be a model worker, since he kept the stables immaculately clean and groomed the horses, including one named ""Nugget."" Through Dysart's questioning, it becomes clear that Alan is erotically fixated on Nugget (or 'Equus') and secretly takes him for midnight rides, bareback and naked. Alan also envisions himself as a king, on the godhead Equus, both destroying their enemies.In the climax, Dysart gives Alan a placebo ""truth pill"" and revealing a tryst with Jill, begins to re-enact the event. Jill, who had taken an interest in Alan, had asked him to take her to a porno theater after he confided in her that he never had sex before and Jill apparently decided to show him ""how it's done"". While there, they both ran into Frank. Alan was traumatized, particularly when he realized that his father was lying when he tried to justify his presence in the theater. However, this occurrence allows Alan to realize that sex is a natural thing for all men... even his father. Alan walks Jill home after they leave. She convinces Alan to come to the stables with her.Once there, Jill seduces Alan and the two start having wild sex. However, Alan breaks this off when he hears the horses making noises in the stables beneath. Jill tries to ask Alan what the problem is, but he shouts at her to leave. After Jill puts back on her clothes and walks out of the stables, the stark nude Alan begs the horses for forgiveness for having pre-marital sex, as he sees the horses as God-like figures. ""Mine!...You're mine!...I am yours and you are mine!"" cries Equus through Dysart's voice, but then he becomes threatening: ""The Lord thy God is a jealous God,"" Equus/Dysart seethes, ""He sees you, he sees you forever and ever, Alan. He sees you!...He sees you!"" Alan screams, ""God sees!"" and then he says ""No more. No more, Equus!"" Alan then blinds the six horses in the stable with a steel spike, whose eyes have ""seen"" his very soul. Dalton is the one who runs in and subdues Alan before calling the police. After finishing his story to the shaken Dysart, Alan is taken away in a straightjacket to a isolation cell of the hospital.The final scene has another monologue by Dysart questioning the fundamentals of his practice and whether or not what he does will actually help Alan, as the effect of his treatment will remove Alan's humanity which includes his intense sexual and religious commitment, and his worship of the horses as well."

The movie was filmed on USC's Fraternity Row on 28th St. in Los Angeles at both the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity tudor style mansion and the Delta Delta Delta Sorority mansion across the street. The film was inspired by a similar fraternity house tragedy that supposedly took place at the Kappa Sigma Fraternity house at USC, also on 28th St., back around the time in the 50s when Ozzie & Harriet's sons, Rick and David Nelson were attending members. Peter Fox (Rodger) is Michael J. Fox's older brother. Nancy Morgan (Jennifer) was the late actor, John Ritter's wife.

tt0076150,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","New Jersey, 1961. Alice Spages (Paula E. Sheppard) is a 12-year old girl who lives with her mother, Catherine (Linda Miller), and her younger 10-year-old sister, Karen (Brooke Shields). Their father, Dominic (Niles McMaster), is divorced from Catherine, and has recently re-married. Catherine and the girls live in a humble apartment, and their lives are very much centered on their Catholic parish. Both Alice and Karen go to the small Catholic school associated with their church, and all of the students wear church-issued yellow rain slickers as part of their uniforms. Karen is just about to make her first holy communion, but Alice seems to be jealous of the attention that Karen is getting because of it. Alice appears to have some major emotional problems.In the opening scene, Alice, Catherine and Karen are visiting the young priest Father Tom (Rudolph Willrich) at the rectory, discussing Karen's upcoming first Holy Communion. Alice startles the rectory's housekeeper, Mrs. Tredoni (Mildred Clinton), by wearing a bizarre translucent mask, and she terrorizes Karen by stealing her doll and luring her to an abandoned building. While inside the building, Alice frightens Karen with the mask and briefly locks her in a room alone, threatening to never return her doll if she tells their mother about the incident. In the family's apartment, Alice takes Karen's communion veil and models it herself in a mirror; Karen causes a commotion over it and Catherine has to intervene.Things go from bad to worse on the day of Karen's communion. As the parishioners sit in the pews waiting for the children to enter the sanctuary, Catherine and her younger sister Annie (Jane Lowry) notice that Alice is not with them. Annie sends her daughter Angela (Kathy Rich) to look for Alice. Before Karen can join the rest of the girls who are dressed in their white communion dresses and veils, she is attacked by a figure in one of the school's yellow rain slickers, wearing the same translucent mask that Alice wears. The figure strangles Karen and then stows her body in a hollow bench, setting it on fire. Just before burning the body, the killer snatches the small cross that Karen wears around her neck, ripping the pendant from her body. Alice then appears among the younger girls, in Karen's place and wearing her veil, awaiting holy communion. Annie is outraged and urges Catherine to put a stop to it immediately. Shortly after, a nun notices the smoke and discovers Karen's body, her screams summoning the rest of the congregation. Annie sees Karen's body and melodramatically tells Catherine that her daughter is dead. Catherine breaks down crying. Alice slips Karen's veil into her pocket.Dominic returns for Karen's funeral and Catherine weeps when she sees him. The domineering Annie imposes herself on Catherine and Alice, insisting that she will stay with them to help Catherine with anything she needs. Alice is resentful of Annie's presence, and wants to stay home with her mother instead of going back to school. Annie's obvious dislike for the girl gives way to accusations about Karen's murder; Annie points out the fact that Alice's whereabouts during the murder are unaccounted for. Catherine seems to be unwilling to admit that Alice acts strangely, insisting that nobody understands Alice like she does. She has to smooth over a confrontation between Annie and Alice, sending Alice on an errand to defuse the argument.Catherine has Alice take the rent check to the family's landlord, Mr. Alphonso (Alphonso DeNoble), who lives in one of the lower apartments of the building. Alphonso is a grotesque man, extremely obese and living in an apartment full of kittens, with old music playing regularly in the background of his apartment; we see him feeding the kittens, referring to himself as ""mommy"", and then eating some of the moist cat food himself. Alphonso has repeatedly made jabs at Alice regarding Karen's death; he aligns himself with Alice's Aunt Annie, saying that Alice must have had something to do with Karen's murder. He also tells Alice that he knows about the odd shrine she has in the basement of the building, where she keeps various objects that she has either found or stolen, including the mask and Karen's missing doll. He tells Alice that Karen will return from the dead to collect her doll. When he makes inappropriate advances toward Alice and begins to touch her in a lewd manner, Alice, in retaliation, throttles one of the kittens and strangles it to death and yelling ""you never do that again!"", upsetting Alphonso and allowing her to escape.Meanwhile, the detectives investigating Karen's murder summon Alice's school records from the parish. When Dominic visits the police station to discuss Karen's case, he becomes hostile when Detective Brennan (Tom Signorelli) suggests that he would like to question Alice about the murder. He phones the rectory to talk to Father Tom, with whom he is apparently familiar; at first his phone call is intercepted by Mrs. Tredoni, who is fiercely protective of the priests and the elderly monsignor who reside there. Tom picks up an extension and talks to Dominic, asking if they can meet in person. Dominic seems unaware of Alice's emotional problems, which have resulted in a number of questionable incidents at school. Father Tom tells him that Alice has a knack for causing trouble and making it seem like an accident.Alice goes into the basement to her shrine, where she keeps her strange items, one of them being a jar full of large cockroaches, which she keeps alive by feeding them. She also still has Karen's doll. Alice puts on her mask.Upstairs, the mysterious figure wearing the yellow rain slicker and mask is creeping around the hallways. Annie goes to leave the apartment and she is attacked by the figure. The killer stands on the landing and slashes at Annie's legs and feet was she walks down the stairs, seriously wounding her with a kitchen knife. Before the killer can administer the death blow, Annie's screams summon Mr. Alphonso, who sees the killer's outfit and immediately identifies it as Alice. As the masked raincoat figure flees, Annie, who is hysterical and terrified, drags herself out into the street in the pouring rain, where Catherine finds her. Dominic and Father Tom happen to pull up at the same time, in Father Tom's car. Tom and Catherine rush Annie to the hospital, while Dominic goes into the building to look for the person who attacked Annie. In the basement, he finds Alice at her shrine, terrified; she claims she saw Karen, apparently believing what Alphonso told her about Karen returning to claim her doll. Dominic comforts her; like Catherine, Dominic doesn't believe that Alice could be a killer.At the hospital, Catherine tries to get Annie to recant her story about being attacked by ""Alice"", but Detective Cranston (Ted Tinling) shows up to question Annie and she becomes hysterical, screaming that Alice was the one who stabbed her. They bring Alice into the police station to question her, giving her a lie detector test. Although Alice does not implicate herself, she gives a number of strange responses; one of the things that the lie detector machine reveals is that Alice sincerely believes that Karen is the one who attacked Aunt Annie. Alice resents being questioned, even lashing out at the lie detector machine, deliberately throwing it on the floor when they leave her alone with it.Although the police cannot charge Alice with either Karen's murder or Annie's slashing, they still feel she may be responsible for one or both, and they order her to have a psychological evaluation at the Sara Reed Children's Hospital. Catherine and Dominic are furious, but try to make the best of it. They visit Alice at the hospital together, discussing the case with the doctor who examines her, Dr. Whitman (Louisa Horton). Dr. Whitman's evaluation seems especially damning, suggesting that Alice is schizophrenic and possibly dangerous. Whitman refuses to allow Alice to be released.Dominic and Catherine have a quiet moment back at Catherine's apartment, when Catherine gets a strange phone call consisting of nothing but breathing; we see the caller is wearing the translucent mask. When the caller hangs up, Catherine assumes it was Annie; since Annie identified Alice as her attacker, Catherine vowed to disown Annie forever. Discussing the recent tragic events of their lives, Dominic and Catherine both agree that Alice could not have been responsible for all that's happened. Dominic suggests that perhaps Angela was the one who attacked Annie, which could explain why Alice thought she saw Karen, since they all wear the same yellow raincoat. Catherine, however, points out that Angela is an overweight young girl, and Karen was very petite, so it would be unlikely for Alice to confuse them. They wind up holding each other and beginning to make love, but are interrupted by a phone call from Dominic's wife, which breaks the mood.Dominic returns to his hotel in time to receive a phone call from a sobbing voice; the caller identifies herself as Angela, saying that she ran away from home and needs Dominic to help her. She asks him to come to the abandoned building, the same one where Alice scared Karen at the beginning of the movie. When Dominic arrives, he sees the figure in the yellow raincoat and mask off in the distance. When he follows her into the building, she attacks him with the kitchen knife, stabbing him in the shoulder. Still unsure of who it is, Dominic follows her up a staircase, where the figure surprises him and bludgeons him repeatedly with a brick.With Dominic unconscious, the figure binds him with a cord and rolls him over to a loading door; the drop over the precipice is three or four stories to the ground. Dominic regains consciousness and realizes he is about to fall to his death. The killer removes the mask to reveal Mrs. Tredoni underneath. She rants about Dominic's relationship with Catherine, revealing that she knows that Alice was conceived before Dominic and Catherine were married. Dominic screams for help, but the area is too desolate for anybody to hear him. He uses his teeth to grab the crucifix that Mrs. Tredoni wears, the same one that she pulled from Karen's body the day she killed her. Mrs. Tredoni notices it and uses the brick to try and smash in Dominic's teeth. He refuses to give up the cross, swallowing it instead. Mrs. Tredoni, now furious, pushes him over the ledge and he falls to his death.Mrs. Tredoni then goes to the church, where a group of children are being instructed on how to make their first confession. Father Tom is the one who is going to hear the children, but he goes into the confessional to find that Mrs. Tredoni is already in there, changing out of the costume she wears to impersonate Alice. She pretends she is seeking to make a confession, and claims she feels guilty about having thoughts regarding the Monsignor; she says that he is in such poor health that she sometimes wishes he would pass away. Father Tom tells her she is a good woman, and that she doesn't need to come to confession about this since her thoughts are not sinful. He praises her for the care she has given himself and the other priests, and she is ecstatic when he calls her a friend.The next day, Catherine becomes worried when she does not hear from Dominic, and she goes to the rectory to look for him; she reasons that since he has been borrowing Father Tom's car, he may be there. She is greeted by Mrs. Tredoni, who tries to get rid of her but finally allows her in to wait for Father Tom. Mrs. Tredoni is gutting fish for that evening's dinner, and she brings Catherine into the kitchen after preparing coffee for her. Catherine is uneasy, when Mrs. Tredoni reveals that she also had a daughter who died on the day of her first holy communion, Mrs. Tredoni seizes the kitchen knife and brandishes it toward Catherine while calling her a whore for having her own child out of wedlock. Father Tom returns and interrupts their conversation, telling Catherine that Dominic's body has been discovered. Catherine weeps in frustration and horror.Dominic's murder suggests that Alice is no longer a suspect, and Catherine is able to take her home. After they return, the figure in the yellow rain slicker and mask enters Alphonso's apartment while he is sleeping, and places the jar of roaches from Alice's secret shrine on his chest. Removing the mask, the figure reveals itself to be Alice herself. Catherine catches her leaving Alphonso's apartment, but Alice explains that she was only saying hello to him after returning from the hospital. Catherine praises her for being kind to him, and they leave to go to mass.Outside, Detective Cranston is watching the building as protection for Alice and Catherine. When they leave the building, Mrs. Tredoni slips in the back through the basement, wearing the yellow rain slicker and mask. She goes up to Catherine's apartment, apparently planning on murdering the first person she sees, but she finds the door locked. As she knocks on Catherine's door, Alphonso awakens and reacts in horror when the roaches begin to crawl over him. He starts screaming and alerts Cranston that something is wrong. Mrs. Tredoni hears it too, and she panics that he is drawing attention to the scene too soon. She runs back down the stairs, but Alphonso emerges and sees her running past his apartment. Thinking her to be Alice, he grabs her and starts to manhandle her, so she pulls out the kitchen knife and stabs him in the chest several times. He stumbles back into his apartment and dies. Cranston arrives at Alphonso's room, too late to help him. When Mrs. Tredoni tries to escape through the basement, Cranston smashes down the front door and sees her. In her panic, she has forgotten to put the mask back on, and he easily identifies her.Still wearing the yellow slicker, Mrs. Tredoni returns to the church and enters the sanctuary during service, making her way to where Alice and Catherine are sitting. Outside, the police arrive and discuss the best way to apprehend Mrs. Tredoni. Father Tom warns them not to try and confront her, as she is too close to Alice and her mother. Tom believes he can convince Mrs. Tredoni to come peacefully, since she adores him.During communion, Alice, Catherine, and Mrs. Tredoni all come up to the front side by side. Father Tom gives Catherine the wafer, but skips Alice. He also skips Mrs. Tredoni, instead leaning toward her and quietly asking her to go with the police. Mrs. Tredoni becomes indignant and asks why he will not give her communion; becoming furious, she shouts ""But you give it to the whore!"", pointing at Catherine. In a rage, Mrs. Tredoni pulls out the knife and stabs Father Tom through the throat. The congregation reacts in horror. Mrs. Tredoni clutches Father Tom to her as he dies, his blood pouring over the yellow rain slicker. Alice remains curiously detached from what is happening. In the confusion, a few policemen run into the church and arrest Mrs. Tredoni, while Alice has claimed Mrs. Tredoni's bag. Alice, still having not received communion, walks out of the church and pulls out the knife briefly, fondling the handle and smiling to herself (insinuating that Alice might one day adopt Mrs. Tredoni's murderous killing spree herself)."
tt0076168,"['Action', 'Drama']","An opening narration explains that the ruling Manchurian Court has tracked a resistance movement against its rule, to the Shaolin Temple, which they were using as a cover for their activities. They ordered one of their chief enforcers, priest Pai Mei, to lead a raid on the temple. Pai Mei and his right-hand lieutenant, Governor Kao Jinzhong, led an army and set the temple on fire. In a bid to save his students, the head priest of Shaolin, Chi Shan, engaged Pai Mei in a crucial duel to the death.The opening credits play as Chi Shan and Pai Mei are shown engaging in their battle against a plain red-screen backdrop. The kung-fu duel seems close to evenly matched until Chi Shan executes a kick to Pai Mei's groin. But Pai Mei, as a eunuch, has no testes, and has further trained his body that someone trying to kick him in the groin only ends up with their foot stuck between his legs. Pai Mei knocks Chi Shan to the ground and drags him backward, by his trapped foot, several yards, before finally breaking both of the Shaolin high priest's legs.A contingent of rebels, led by a senior member of the movement, Hong Xiguan, is fleeing the Shaolin Temple. Many rebels are wounded from fighting, some dropping as they run. Hong has to urge his best friend, Xiao Hu, another leader, to keep running.They meet up with another of the rebel captains, Tong Qianjin, who is leading another contingent of rebel fighters. Hong is alarmed that Tong is the only member of his contingent to escape. Tong brings news that Chi Shan was killed by Pai Mei. Hearing that his teacher and master has been killed, Hong Xiguan goes into a rage and tries to run back to the temple to exact revenge. Tong, Xiao Hu and all of the other men led by Hong, all run after him to stop him. They know they've lost the battle, but a lot of their men escaped, and trying to avenge Chi Shan now will only result in their rebellion being completely wiped out.They run into an ambush of Manchurian archers, who take some more of the rebels down. Tong is wounded, an arrow piercing his leg. He pleads with Hong to take command, and then Tong takes a few soldiers to provide cover by engaging the archers. While the archers are reloading, Tong and his men rush at them, attacking with swords and hand-to-hand. Archers not under direct attack cannot fire again without hitting their own fighters.Tong is handling nearly the whole contingent of Manchurian swordsmen by himself when Governor Kao Jinzhong arrives. Governor Kao orders the small group of men with him to take Tong alive, but they are no match for him. Kao then sends his majordomo, a Qing Court Fighter, to battle Tong. The Qing fighter is more of a match for Tong and seizes an early advantage. But when Governor Kao mocks Tong and tells him not to resist, Tong becomes angry and and more fierce, taking on the Qing Fighter and the rest of Kao's men all together and beating them. Finally Tong reaches Governor Kao himself, and even Kao's kung fu fails against Tong's onslaught. Governor Kao is badly injured, and losing his patience, orders the archers to kill Tong, even at the cost of friendly casualties. The rain of arrows take down several Manchurian fighters as well as Tong, and even in death, Tong's face is frozen in a look of stoicism and determination that gives Governor Kao pause.At the Manchurian Court, Governor Kao, still hurt from his duel with Tong Qianjin, reports to the Royal Highness. The court is pleased with the success of the raid on the temple, but Kao is still deeply concerned with the ferocity of the Shaolin rebel resistance. Pai Mei is not worried. He is sure that his victory over the Shaolin high priest has spread fear through the resistance and sent the message that his kung-fu is unbeatable. He tells Governor Kao to simply continue his search without letup, and in the end, Pai Mei is sure that Kao will capture or kill all of the rebels.Hong Xiguan and Xiao Hu have split up. Xiao and his men make their way to the border of Gwangzhou and come across a small town where a theater troupe is putting on a play based on a local figure named Yue Fei. The troupe is also part of the resistance movement, and the Manchurians have tracked them to the town. A squad of Manchurian soldiers raid the theater. The troupe's leader, Master Chen, and a number of his men escape. Xiao Hu sees them being pursued and rushes to aid them, killing the Manchurian pursuers.Chen brings Xiao Hu to a 'red boat,' a group of Shaolin rebels that have established cover as theater performers traveling along the riverways by boat. Hong addresses the men on the boat, telling them to remember the temple and the priests and brothers who died defending them. They have come back to Kwangtung, a province under Governor Kao's control, to continue the fight. Hong says they must divide their strength and thus become more vulnerable, to ensure they are never completely wiped out. They will continue traveling and performing, discreetly giving aid to oppressed townfolk wherever possible and engaging Manchurians in ongoing guerilla tactics.At a riverside village, a woman named Fang Yongchun is giving a kung-fu demonstration. The Red Boats arrive as she is giving her demonstration, and many of the villagers run to greet them, which makes Yongchun jealous. She complains to her uncle about their continued arrival wherever she and he go to stage their own performance.The Red Boat troupe debarks from their boat, giving their pitch to the villagers about their latest show, and giving a small kung-fu demonstration as a sampler. A jealous Yongchun marches up to them and tells them that she thinks their kung fu is nothing special and orders them to leave the village. Xiao Hu, flustered, tells his men to escort Yongchun away. But Yongchun handles all of them easy with her own kung fu, proving far better than them. Xiao Hu spars with Yongchun himself, to find that she is able to take a stance so firm and stable that he cannot budge her legs and feet, even by kicking at them. She shrugs his blows off and then kicks him away, causing the villagers to laugh.Hong Xiguan arrives and he's impressed with her technique. Yongchun offers to take him on, saying she has plenty of fight left in her. Intrigued, Hong spars with Yongchun, and the two of them are evenly matched. As they battle, they recognize each other's style and technique: Hong is expert in tiger kung fu, while Yongchun is a crane kung fu artist. Uncle Fang finally tells Yongchun to back down. Hong is impressed with Yongchun's skill, apologizing on behalf of his men. Seeing that Yongchun is also a traveling kung fu performer, he invites her and her uncle to travel with them on the Red Boat. Yonchun isn't too thrilled about the idea, until she and Uncle Fang overhear Xiaohu call Hong, 'Brother Hong.' Immediately they both recognize the name and know that he is Hong Xiguan.Yongchun and Uncle Fang travel with the Red Boat, and Yongchun and Hong begin to grow increasingly close. Xiao Hu, who has become something of an incorrigible prankster from his time posing as a theater performer, jokes about needing to start calling Yongchun, 'Mrs. Hong' (a brief, amusing scene follows where Yongchun chases Xiao Hu about the boat to smack him one). But Xiao proves right, as soon after, Yongchun and Hong are married. Even on their wedding day, Xiao's mischief is near relentless, and both Hong and Uncle Fang must keep both Xiao and Yongchun (who's ready to give him another thrashing) reined in. Even when a cabin is prepared as a bridal suite for the marriage to be consummated, Hong has to throw Xiao Hu and the other performers off to get some peace with Yongchun.Xiao's persistence in trying to eavesdrop and spy finally drives Yongchun to some mischief of her own. She clamps her knees together while lying on the bridal bed, challenging Hong to push her knees apart if he wants to consummate the marriage that night. Hong finds that all his strength cannot budge Yongchun's sturdy legs, and she smiles in complacent satsifaction as she bids her husband good night.The next morning Xiao Hu finds Hong asleep outside the cabin, and Hong angrily drives him off the boat. Later in the day, as Uncle Fang is returning with the rest of the men with more supplies for the boat, he and Hong talk, and Uncle Fang has some advice for keeping Xiao Hu in line. That night, Hong tells Yongchun he's ready to give another try. She lies down on the bed and presses her knees together. After a few moments, Hong comes up with a kung fu technique that successfully pushes her knees apart. Yongchun petulantly swats at Hong, who fends her off as he tumbles into the bed and draws its curtains closed with his feet.Governor Kao finds out that the Shaolin rebels are using the Red boats as cover. He dispatches soldiers to burn the boats, flush out the rebels and kill them. Over several months, a number of boats are burned and its crew slaughtered. A few survivors manage to make it to Hong's boat. Hong says they have to give up their last boat, get to shore and all scatter, keeping in contact as necessary to continue their work. Xiao Hu, his demeanor properly respectful and disciplined now, wants to go with Hong and Yongchun, since Uncle Fang has gone up north.Months pass. Hong and Yongchun have settled in a house in a quiet town. One day Xiao Hu comes to Hong with urgent news. Yongchun is about to deliver a baby. The two rush back to Hong's home where Yongchun is being tended to by the town midwife. The baby is a boy, and Hong and Yonchun name him Wen-Ding.Nighttime, six months later. Yongchun sews a baby garment, her infant son in a crib nearby, while Hong studies a manual of advanced tiger kung fu. Hong is concerned because he hasn't been practicing lately, and he needs to get his kung fu back into peak form. His primary goal is still avenging his master, and his friend Tong. Yongchun is deeply worried. Tiger kung fu is nearly unbeatable, but Pai Mei is no ordinary kung fu expert, having strength unmatched by any. Yongchun wants to teach some of her crane style to Hong to supplement his tiger technique. But Hong, proud and stubborn, refuses to do this. Against Yongchun's better judgement, he's gotten her to make an agreement that they will not learn each other's kung fu technique. When Yongchun tells Hong that he'll have to practice ten years in order to depend entirely on tiger style, Hong says without hesitation, that he'll do so.
Ten years have passed and Hong is able to rip the bark off of trees, and even knock down young trees with his bare hands. Meanwhile, Yongchun has been teaching crane kung fu to Wending.Yongchun has had Wending practice holding a basic crane stance for as long as he is able to concentrate on holding it. A group of young boys comes by and starts making fun of him. Because of Wending's hair style and learning the style of kung fu practiced by his mother, rather than his father, the other children think that Wending is overly effeminate. They hop into the yard where he is stancing and try to pull his legs apart to topple his stance, but he holds firm and throws them all off with a simple knee flex, which brings a smile to his mother's face. Finally Wending chases all of them away from the house and into the field. Yongchun tries to call him back but then relents.Hong, however, is less pleased when he sees Wending wrestling with one of the boys. However, when Wending hangs his head very sadly after a scolding, Hong also backs away and becomes more gentle. Moved to mischief, Wending leaps up on his father's shoulders, challenging Hong to topple him. If Hong can't, Wending says he gets to ride home on Hong's shoulders. Hong is at first reluctant because he doesn't want Wending to be hurt. But he finds that the ten-year-old's stancing and leg and foot strength has become very firm in its own right, and he can't topple his son off his shoulders. Looking both impressed and vexed, Hong carries his son home.But on arriving home, Hong needs to talk seriously with both his wife and son. Resistance scouts have found the location of a temple that serves as Pai Mei's base of operations. Hong tells Wending why Pai Mei has to be killed. Yongchun is still deeply worried that Hong will not be strong enough to beat Pai Mei using only tiger kung fu. She tells him that if Hong can, to kill Pai Mei, but if not, he should run. Hong looks at his wife and gives a nod of assent.Hong finds the Pai Mei temple relatively unguarded. Two acolytes sweep the long stairway leading up the hill. He easily subdues them and drags them to the outer cloister of the temple, where a group of acolytes see him and rush to defend. Even all together they are no match for Hong, and he is beating them from pillar to post.Pai Mei finally comes out and orders his acolytes off. Pai Mei is unworried and amused on realizing that Hong Xiguan has come for him. He tells Hong that the rules of the temple dictate that Hong must defeat two swordsmen before he can challenge Pai Mei himself to battle. The two swordsmen attack, and Hong dodges their swishing blades until he is able to disarm them both and use the swords to kill them.But in Pai Mei, Hong finds he's met his match and more, as Pai Mei easily fends him off, hardly attacking, seemingly toying with Hong as he taunts his adversary, trying to get Hong to admit that Pai Mei is better at tiger kung fu. When Hong lands a tiger claw strike to Pai Mei's groin, Pai Mei merely asks him, ""Can't you find it?"" Hong delivers a tiger claw strike to Pai Mei's eyes and face, but Pai Mei takes the impact like a stone statue and strikes Hong aside like a paper doll. Suddenly Pai Mei starts hitting back, delivering several blows that cause blood to trickle from Hong's mouth. Hong hears Yongchun's words to him in his head and, despite his pride, is able to silently force himself to admit he's been beaten. Striking aside the acolytes who are behind him, Hong turns and sprints out of the cloister to make his escape.Hong loses his footing as he rushes to the stairway and starts to tumble down them. Rushing to a massive urn-shaped stone sculpture at the peak of the stairs, Pai Mai shoves it off its small dais, causing it to roll down the stairs after Hong. The urn is about to roll over Hong and crush him when Xiao Hu leaps in front of it, deflecting it just enough that Hong is able to roll out of the way.In so doing, however, Xiao Hu is mortally wounded. With his dying breath, he tells Hong something crucial that he's learned; Pai Mei is weakest between the hours of 1 pm and 3 pm. Hong is distraught at seeing Xiao Hu die before his eyes, but Pai Mei and his acolytes are starting to run down the stairway. Turning, he leaps over a stone fence and finishes his escape.Back home, Hong is nursed by Yongchun. Wending is also saddened at the death of Xiao Hu, who was like an uncle to him. He rushes away, crying out that he needs to finish growing up into adulthood.
Seven more years pass and Wending is a young adult. Although more mature, he has developed a determination to be able to outspar his parents that borders on obsession. Again, Yongchun is more forgiving than Hong. Over the last few years, Hong has been studying and relentlessly training in the more advanced aspects of tiger style kung fu. In his practice area is a bronze training statue, with many metal ball bearings fitted into various groves. Hong strikes areas on the statue to make the ball bearings slide down the grooves, and then plucks one out. Some of the ball bearings are painted with symbols corresponding to various times of day. Nearby are several wooden markers that catch the sun's shadow, and are also painted with similar time symbols. Hong finally catches a particular ball bearing with a particular symbol and starts to speak Pai Mei's name.Wending picks that moment to moment to leap in and try to catch Hong off-guard. Unfortunately, despite his growing skill and self-confidence, Wending can't quite match his father. Adding to this his obsessive desire to do so, and even at the dinner table he can't resist a chance to sneak in a blow. One night the sparring gets out of control, and several freshly washed clothes are knocked off the clotheslines, and a few of them are torn. Finally losing her patience, Yongchun makes them re-wash the clothes, and sew up the torn ones.Yongchun smiles as she sees Hong prick his finger on a sewing needle, but when the sight of his blood brings a hard look to Hong's eyes, her expression becomes concerned again. She goes to him and he says that the last few days have had him thinking hard about his oath. He's practiced particularly hard the past few years, and while he and his Shaolin brothers have continued fighting Manchurian rule, they can't make much progress unless Pai Mei were killed. Yongchun looks particularly worried, and more so the next day when Hong sets out. When Wending asks her about it, she confides in him that she's positive that Pai Mei let Hong escape last time because Pai Mei was far superior to him. But Hong's tiger kung fu has improved significantly by now, meaning Pai Mei will take him as much more of a threat. Yongchun is sure that if Pai Mei defeats Hong again, he'll make completely certain that Hong doesn't escape again.Hearing this, Wending rushes out to stop Hong from leaving. He's even ready to fight his father again to keep him from going to his death; battling harder than ever. After defeating his son again, Hong gives him a hard lecture on how many of Hong's fellow Shaolin fighters died for him and those who still fight today; including Chi Shan and Tong Qianjin... and Xiao Hu, who Wending himself said he wanted to emulate as a hero. Despite all this, Hong has bided his time, also waiting for Wending to reach young manhood, but now he feels that if he continues putting off his oath, he will lose the will and courage to continue fighting.When acolytes spot Hong's approach, they race in fear back to the inner parts of the temple. This time Pai Mei has many more fighters and Manchurian soldiers at his disposal, all of whom try to stop Hong. Wielding his staff with fury, Hong sweeps them aside. At the top of the stairs, Hong notes the sun overhead and jams one end of his staff into the earth, noting by its shadow that it's 1 pm. Fighting unarmed now, he again sweeps aside the guards and soldiers toward the inner cloister. Acolytes tell all the other fighters that Pai Mei has ordered them to disengage and block off all exits from the temple to prevent escape.Governor Kao is with Pai Mei in the inner cloister. Pai Mei looks pleased to see Hong, saying he knew there was no need to search for Hong, since Hong would return to the temple eventually, looking to make another attempt to kill Pai Mei.Governor Kao engages Hong first, and Hong handles him and his personal guard almost as easily as the rank-and-file fighters; Pai Mei noting how much improved Hong is. Hong engages Pai Mei and seizes an early advantage, staggering him briefly and ripping a patch off the front of his tunic. He staggers Pai Mei again, landing several tiger claw attacks. Pai Mei sees he can no longer toy with Hong and starts to fight more aggressively, like in his duel with high priest Chi Shan. But after striking Hong aside, he says that Hong is using the tiger style to lead his attack, and can't hope to reach Pai Mei's vital point.They clash again, Pai Mei hitting Hong hard and sending him sprawling. Hong notes by more shadows cast by the sunlight that the time is 3 pm. Pai Mei spots Hong looking at another shadow on the ground and smiles, taking a guard stance that gives Hong a moment's pause. When Pai Mei's hands both move to guard low, Hong attacks again. Once more they clash hard until Hong lands a kick to Pai Mei's groin.As with Chi Shan, Hong's foot becomes trapped there, and falls prey to the same counterattack that beat Chi Shan. Pai Mei knocks him to the ground, drags him backward by his foot several yards, and delivers crushing blows to both of Hong's legs. Standing over Hong and gloating, he says that Hong was almost right in deducing the location of Pai Mei's weak point, but over the years he's learned to move it at will, and now, when it's supposed to be down low near his groin, it's actually up high at the crown of his head.Pai Mei tells Governor Kao to take Hong alive, as there is much information about the Shaolin resistance that the Manchurian court can torture out of him. But as Kao's men move to seize Hong, he suddenly strikes out again, smashing aside the men and suddenly taking out Governor Kao's leg and using a finger strike right at his throat. Pai Mei executes a sweeping blow that sends both Hong and retinue guards all flying. Much to Pai Mei's outrage, Governor Kao is dead... and so is Hong.Hong had told Yongchun and Wending that he would return in ten days. When twelve have passed, Yongchun knows that her husband is dead. She tells Wending that if he wishes to truly aspire to be a hero, as his father and Xiao Hu, it falls on him to face Pai Mei. But she tells him that he shouldn't use his crane kung fu until necessary; at first he should use tiger style. But Hong had never been willing teach tiger style to Wending, because Yongchun had been teaching him crane. Hong's pride and stubbornness were such that he believed that tiger style should never be combined with crane. Yongchun remembers that Hong kept a study manual, and they need to find it.When Wending finally finds the manual, he finds to his dismay that age and vermin have caused most of the pages to be badly damaged, and it looks plausible that Hong had torn many of the pages himself after moving on to more advanced technique. When Yongchun asks to see the manual, Wending is afraid to show her how badly damaged it is, and manages to talk her into backing down by reminding her of her agreement with her husband never to learn each other's styles.Wending spends a year practicing and learning as best he can from the manual, although he cannot be certain exactly what it means when he catches specific ball bearings from the grooves in the brass training dummy. When he catches unmarked beads, he's not sure of the exact moment that a particular time marked bead fell out of the dummy, so he's not sure if he hit too fast, or too slow, or the wrong part of the dummy.Yongchun asks to see Wending do one of the exercises. When she tells him that one movement didn't look right, and he needs to do it again, Wending uncomfortably says that he worries it will remind her too much of Hong and make her upset. Yongchun becomes quiet again and tells Wending that he was right. She leaves the training area so Wending can practice alone again.Wending goes into the field, performing a number of tiger movements. Unfortunately the manual is too damaged to show the next followup moves. Finally Wending decides that at this point he'll stick to crane style.Finally Wending and Yongchun feel that he's as ready as he'll ever be. Wending has only trained in tiger style for one year, but he's trained very hard, and he has his crane style as a supplement, something Pai Mei has never faced in the Shaolin resistance.Wending goes to the Pai Mei temple. With the death of Hong Xiguan, the temple is mostly unguarded again, and Wending has little difficulty sneaking to the inner cloister where Pai Mei is meditating. Wending first asks if Pai Mei is the same person who killed the Shaolin high priest and Hong Xiguan. Pai Mei simply nods affirmative. Wending attacks, Pai Mei noticing that the initial strikes are tiger style. A large number of acolytes rush in after an intial clash between Pai Mei and Wending.Pai Mei notes that Wending's tiger kung fu is nowhere near the match for Hong Xiguan. He wonders aloud how many more Shaolin fighters there are, and asks Wending his name. When Wending tells Pai Mei his full name and says he's Hong Xiguan's son, Pai Mei is pleased. He's more than ready to kill Hong's son. Still, Pai Mei doesn't take Wending as much of a threat, until one of Wending's attacks rips loose a piece of Pai Mei's beard, and then in another clash, Wending tears the sleeves off of Pai Mei's robe. Pai Mei is confounded, as many of the moves Wending moves seem almost custom developed; he is used to facing standard tiger style, while Wending is combining it with crane. Pai Mei becomes angry and starts to fight harder, grabbing initiative and smashing Wending around several times. And even when he has the advantage, and after delivering a hard blow that has Wending bleeding from the mouth, Wending's kung fu is leaving him confounded and increasingly angry.They clash on the outer cloister. Wending fakes being hurt worse than he is, collapsing to the ground, and then delivers a kick. The kick hits Pai Mei in the groin, taking him off guard for a brief second, but then Pai Mei traps Wending's foot, the same as with Chi Shan and Hong. Pai Mei asks if Wending has any further tricks up his sleeve, before throwing the deadly attacks meant to break his legs and end the fight.But Wending does have another trick; he vaults up in the air with a crane maneuver and sits on Pai Mei's shoulders. As with Hong so many years ago, Pai Mei finds he cannot break Wending's crane stance and can't topple the young fighter from off his shoulders. He manages to throw Wending's weight backward and lands a scoop kick, but this only rights Wending's posture, and with a tiger move, Wending tears a large patch of hair off the crown of Pai Mei's head, and follows with a crane-beak attack right to the crown of Pai Mei's head, and then a double crane beak strike to his eyes.Having struck Pai Mei's vital point, the double crane beak attack proves completely devastating; Pai Mei screaming in wild agony, spinning around on his feet. He loses his balance, taking Wending with him as he rolls down the stairs. The camera freezes as Pai Mei convulses wildly into the air; a closing narration stating that the combination of tiger and crane kung fu was what finally killed Pai Mei."

tt0076208,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'Not', 'Rated']","Approximately 2,500 years ago, the Athenian tragedians -- Sophocles, Aeschylus, Euripides -- said it all in the most eloquent and poetic terms. Everyone else has followed in their footsteps, from Goethe and Shakespeare to Mann and Beckett. More than ever, the ancient tragedies are relevant today, for their subject matter is the universal nature of man: his hunger for power, his greed, and his lust. The plays are the confirmation of the human tragedy for all times, and all places. The Greek myths upon which these tragedies are based combine marvelous storytelling with symbolic associations that are the foundations of the collective unconscious of our modern world.Euripides left behind some of the most astonishing expressions of human passion and compassion ever set into dramatic form. His plays express a range of delight, hope, and terror unmatched in classical drama. Of these, certainly none display more range than the inexorable bloodletting of the stories of the House of Atreus and the Trojan War, which Euripides treats with characteristic balance in several of his tragedies.For the cinema, Greek myths and ancient tragedies are made-to-order screenplays. Many film directors have tried to take advantage of this gold mine, with varying degrees of success. For some, they have proven to be very expensive failures, as exemplified recently by a prominent Hollywood director, Wolfgang Petersen. Other directors, reworking particular tragedies, have produced freshly reincarnated masterpieces. Such is ""Iphigenia"" (1977), by Greek director Mikhali (Michael) Cacoyannis, based on Euripedes' tragedy, ""Iphigenia in Aulis.""""Iphigenia"" relates the story of an incident that took place just prior to the Trojan War. Helen, wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta, had eloped to Troy with Paris, son of King Priam. Menelaus' brother, Agamemnon, King of Argos, had assembled a huge Greek expeditionary force on the shores of Aulis that he planned to lead to Troy in order to reclaim his brother's wife. The Goddess Artemis, taking revenge for an insult done to her by Agamemnon's father, King Atreus, created a meteorological problem by sending storms, or calms, to prevent the Greek fleet from sailing to Troy. This is where the film begins.The Greek armies have waited for what seems an eternity for the winds to rise, blow eastward, and carry their boats to Troy. The men are tired, bored, hungry, and anxious to go into battle. In a public relations gesture intended to placate the men, Agamemnon (Costa Kazakos) directs them to go and help themselves to a flock of sheep that belong to the nearby temple dedicated to Artemis. In the ensuing mayhem, Artemis' sacred deer is accidentally slain. Calchas (Dimitris Aronis), high priest of Artemis' temple, is incensed by the sacrilege. He delivers an oracle to Agamemnon, with Menelaus (Kostas Karras) and Odysseus (Christos Tsagas) also present. The oracle, according to Calchas emanating from Artemis herself, demands that Agamemnon offers a sacrifice to atone for the defiling of the holy ground and the killing of the sacred stag. Once the sacrifice is made, Artemis will consent for the armies to sail to Troy by allowing the winds to blow eastward. The sacrifice is to be Agamemnon's first-born daughter, Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamoschou). The news of ""the deal"" soon spreads through the armies' ranks, although the nature of the sacrifice remains temporarily unknown to them.After considerable argument and recrimination between the two brothers, Agamemnon sends a message to his wife Clytemnestra (Irene Papas), in Argos. In his letter, Agamemnon is asking his wife to send their daughter Iphigenia, to Aulis, ostensibly to wed Achilles (Panos Mihalopoulos). Achilles, leader of the Mymirdon army, is a member of Agamemnon's expeditionary forces. Against her husband's instructions, Clytemnestra decides to accompany her daughter to Aulis.From this point forward to the climax, the tempo and the development of the tragedy stretches tighter. Agamemnon has second thoughts about his plan. After confessing his ruse to his old servant (Angelos Yannoulis), Agamemnon dispatches him with another letter to Clytemnestra that reveals the truth and tells her to cancel Iphigenia's trip. The old man is intercepted on the road by Menelaus' men and returned to Aulis. In the ensuing confrontation, Menelaus rebukes his brother for betraying the honor of Greece for his personal benefit. Agamemnon argues persuasively, and convinces Menelaus that no war is worth the life of a child. Following their understanding, Agamemnon decides to personally carry the letter to Clytemnestra. Too late. A messenger announces the imminent arrival of the wedding party, which includes Clytemnestra. Agamemnon is stunned by the announcement, and he resigns himself to the worst: ""From now on fate rules. Not I.""Clytemnestra arrives at Aulis filled with happiness over her daughter's prospective wedding the famous Myrmidon leader, Achilles. Iphigenia's first meeting with her father is couched in double entendre which is devastating: as she talks about her upcoming wedding, he talks about her upcoming sacrifice. They use the same words, but the meanings could not be more horribly apart. When Agamemnon meets with Clytemnestra, he still vainly tries to convince her to return to Argos without witnessing the ""wedding."" Clytemnestra and Achilles soon learn the truth from Agamemnon's old servant. Achilles is overcome with shame and rage when he learns of the deceit that has involved him in this tragedy. Clytemnestra rises into a fury, and in desperation, confronts her husband one last time. Agamemnon, however, is trapped in his own web and cannot now back down, as Odysseus has threatened to inform the army of the exact nature of the sacrifice if Agamemnon does not follow through on the oracle's demand.Meanwhile, preparations for the sacrifice are proceeding. ""Let's not delay, the wind is rising,"" says Calchas. Odysseus finally forces the situation when he tells the army who is to be the sacrificial victim. Now, there is no turning back. Iphigenia briefly escapes, but she is soon recaptured by Odysseus' soldiers. In a poignant scene, suggestive of the scene of the slowly dying sacred stag at the beginning of the film, Iphigenia is caught lying down, panting and out of breath, ""dying,"" on the forest floor. Her captors return her to the camp to face her executioners. Now resigned to her fate, she has a last, heartrending meeting with her father, before walking up the hill toward her final destiny. While Agamemnon, surrounded by his cheering army, watches helplessly on the steps below, Iphigenia reaches the top and is quickly grabbed by Calchas. At that same moment, upon seeing the wind rising. Agamemnon runs up the steps and as he reaches the top of hill, his face reflects what we assume is the sight of the dead Iphigenia. However, Cacoyannis chooses to leave the ending somewhat ambiguous: is Iphigenia supernaturally whisked away, as in Euripides' play, or is she sacrificed, in agreement with the tradition? Not having Agamemnon's eyes, we'll never know for sure.A strong wind now blows. The men run to the beach, push their ships into the sea, and sail toward Troy and its promised treasures."

It can't because Kentucky Fried Movie is a collection of (I say) short films. Every one of them is Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker literal humor with a site gag to go along with every line. I loved it. I watch it frequently because you can watch a segment and watch another one later. I was surprised when I realized it came out in 1977. It's a potential stoner movie - I'm surprised it didn't come out in 1972.

tt0076342,"['Biography', 'Drama', 'History', 'War']","As the film opens in 1962, General Douglas MacArthur (Gregory Peck) is at West Point, his alma mater. MacArthur, ramrod straight, reviews the ranks of marching cadets before delivering his poignant, bittersweet, farewell address to the Corps.The action abruptly shifts back to the tunnels of Corregidor in early 1942, where MacArthur's besieged American and Filipino troops are desperately holding out against the victorious forces of Japan. The end is near.In Washington, General George Marshall and Admiral Ernest J. King are simultaneously delivering the grim news to President Roosevelt (Dan O'Herlihy). They discuss global priorities and admit that they can't hold the Philippines. Roosevelt reluctantly decides to order MacArthur off Corregidor, knowing that he will be furious. MacArthur is ordered to board a submarine and slip away to Australia, where he can organize ongoing resistance. But MacArthur refuses to sneak away from his beloved command traveling furtively beneath the waves. He insists on boarding a PT boat, and his family insists on accompanying him on the dangerous voyage. The Japanese navy has thrown a blockade around the islands, and the heavily armed PT boats would be no match for destroyers. The pair of PT boats manage to evade the Japanese pickets and floating mines, proving that the blockade can be circumvented.Eventually arriving in Melbourne, MacArthur discovers that there is no Philippine relief expedition being organized. He addresses the adoring Australian crowds, explaining that his first priority will be the recapture of the Philippines. But he soon learns that Bataan and Corregidor have fallen, leaving 70,000 of his starving men imprisoned under unimaginable conditions.MacArthur decides to mount the defense of Australia among the jungles of New Guinea, where the battle is fought under brutal circumstances. As a result, MacArthur develops his famous island hopping strategy, bypassing Japanese strongholds through the use of Allied naval and air superiority, cutting critical supply lines and starving the isolated Japanese strong points into submission. MacArthur also develops a well-earned reputation for dramatics, self-promotion and vanity.The Allies advance steadily up the Southwest Pacific island chain over the next two years, but not without tremendous bloodshed. Ordered to Honolulu in July 1944 to meet with President Roosevelt and Admirals Leahy and Nimitz, MacArthur upstages his naval rivals with a grandiose, belated arrival. His jealous, distrustful relationship with Roosevelt is apparent. The US Navy wants to bypass the Philippines and take Taiwan first. MacArthur makes an impassioned argument that to do so would be an indelible stain on American honor. He reminds them that numerous promises have been made to the loyal people of the Philippines, including by Roosevelt himself. In the end, MacArthur's view prevails.US forces come ashore at Leyte Gulf in October 1944. In an iconic scene, MacArthur insists on going ashore right behind the second wave of troops. He steps off the landing craft into knee-deep water, wading ashore as the cameras roll. On the beach, MacArthur addresses the Filipinos by radio, exhorting them to drive the Japanese occupiers out. As the battle rages, the General receives his fifth star. He is soon taken to a prison camp where many of the brutalized, emaciated survivors of Bataan and Corregidor have been held for more than two years. Many emotional reunions follow.Back home, President Roosevelt dies in the spring of 1945. Harry Truman succeeds him and authorizes the use of two atomic weapons to bring Japan to her knees. A furious MacArthur rails against this new, impersonal brand of warfare, realizing that an era has passed.Aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay, MacArthur presides over the solemn surrender ceremonies in September 1945.As Allied military governor of Japan, MacArthur institutes liberal social reforms and oversees the complete rebuilding and modernization of Japan. When the Russian military representative in Japan curtly informs MacArthur that Russia will soon commence an illegal occupation of Hokkaido Island, MacArthur just as curtly informs the Russian that the entire Soviet delegation will be thrown in jail. The occupation never occurs.MacArthur is given one last chance at military glory in June 1950 when Communist North Korean forces invade South Korea, moving swiftly and nearly pushing American and South Korean forces off the peninsula. MacArthur is appointed Supreme Commander of UN forces in Korea. He buys time until he can devise a brilliant but risk-laden amphibious landing behind North Korean lines at Inchon. The successful operation proves to be a stroke of genius. North Korean forces are virtually cut off from supplies and reinforcements and have to retreat northward in disarray. MacArthur then carries the fight into North Korea itself. Despite MacArthur's reassurances to the contrary, the Communist Chinese suddenly enter the war in huge numbers in order to bolster their sagging North Korean ally. UN forces are again pushed southward, incurring heavy casualties. MacArthur grows increasingly frustrated, chafing at political interference from Washington.Tensions between Truman and MacArthur boil over when MacArthur's insubordination in the face of direct orders threatens to undermine Truman's authority. After a stellar military career spanning more than a half-century, MacArthur is relieved of command.He returns to a hero's welcome in April 1951 while Truman's popularity plummets. MacArthur delivers a moving retirement address to a joint session of Congress. The movie then moves forward to 1962, and an increasingly frail Douglas MacArthur is bidding farewell to West Point. One last time he utters the famous words that were the hallmark of his career: Duty. Honor. Country."

However, the next day, the note turns up in a head of lettuce at the store and Jerry feels compelled to honor the request.Jerry goes to the appointment meeting place in downtown Los Angeles, California, and finds an office with nothing but a chair and an intercom and he is greeted by a voice on the speaker. The voice attempts to convince the dubious Jerry that he really is God by demonstrating that Jerry is on the 27th floor of a building that actually has only seventeen floors. After Jerry leaves the building completely spooked, the voice begins talking to him through Jerry's supposedly broken car radio. God informs Jerry that he wants him to spread the word that God exists.At home, Jerry tells his wife all about the meeting and encounter. But naturally Bobbie does not believe Jerry and suggests that they go on vacation and visit his brother-in-law, who is a therapist, but Jerry insists he is not crazy, which fuels her suspicions about Jerry and his mental health.The following day, God speaks to Jerry in the shower and then appears to him in the guise of an elderly man (George Burns). When Jerry asks him how He can permit so much suffering in the world, God explains that the world is based on luck and free will. God tells Jerry that it is up to him to inform the world to heed his message, treat one another better, and look after the earth's natural resources. God urges him to go to the press.Jerry visits Briggs (George Furth), a Los Angeles Times reporter, that God asked him to be His messenger, but the journalist is skeptical. Later, God appears to Jerry at the grocery store and asks him to go for a drive. Jerry asks for a sign and God makes it rain inside the car. When Jerry is pulled over by a policeman to inquire about the water leaking from the moving car, Jerry lies to the motorcycle cop by claiming that he left the car windows down while driving through a car wash.

He is alerted by an unknown and unseen presence stalking him, which causes him to gallop for the protection of the trees. He is followed by some unknown enemies who are chasing him, before they surround him and prepare to attack.Meanwhile, a boy and his parents, the last of the summer tourists, leave their dog behind, believing that to be better than taking him to the dog pound. Later that day, he is found by a pack of feral dogs, most of whom were abandoned pets belonging to summer tourists. Their leader, a massive golden-haired mongrel, immediately accepts the dog into his pack.Jerry (Joe Don Baker) has moved to Seal Island with his new wife, Millie (Hope Alexander-Willis), and their two sons. They also brought along their family dog, a German Shepherd named Riley. While dropping off some garbage at the island junkyard, Jerry's dog chases after a rabbit into the trees, but is attacked by an unknown creature and is injured. When Jerry goes back to see what it was that attacked Riley, he discovered that it was a feral dog, who had apparently also stole the rabbit that his dog was chasing. He immediately sent word to the other residents on the island, including the old hermit Mr. McMinnimee (Delos V. Smith Jr.), to keep a watchful eye out for the dog and kill it if they ever see it again.McMinnimee, who lives in a cabin alone with his German Shepherd Shazah, soon learns of the wild dog and returns to his home. When a storm hit the island one evening, Shazah starts up a riot and tries to break out. Armed with his rifle, the old man opens the door to his cabin and tries to find out who is intruding onto his property. Shazah bolts out into the front yard, but is suddenly attacked by the golden-haired mongrel and several other feral dogs. McMinnimee is too late to save his dog from the pack, though he manages to shoot and kill a collie, one of the pack members. As he tries to secure the door and windows to his house, the dogs break through one of the windows and attack the old man, killing him.The following morning, while relaxing in her new house that Jerry had built for her, Millie notices that something is scaring their poultry. She goes outside and discovers the same mongrel that Jerry saw the other day lurking near the poultry yard. She tries to drive it off, but the dog growls at her and attacks, forcing Millie to seek refuge in her Volkswagen car. As the rest of the pack surround the car and try to break in, Jerry arrives and drives the dogs off, killing a Labrador retriever with his shotgun. He takes Millie to town, drops her off at one of the abandoned houses, and warns his neighbor Hardiman (Richard B. Shull) of the pack. While Hardiman leaves to warn the other islanders of the dogs, Jerry picks up his sons and takes them back to the house.Meanwhile, one of the islanders, Jim Dodge (Richard O'Brien) moves to the island with his son Tommy (Paul Willson), a cook Lois (Sherry E. DeBoer), and his wife Marge (Bibi Besch). The day after their arrival, Dodge urges his son Tommy to go for a walk, and Lois goes along with him. During their walk through the forest, Tommy hears the pack of dogs howling nearby and starts running for his life. Lois chases after Tommy, but quickly loses him and is forced to seek refuge in an abandoned barn where the dogs sleep. Tommy runs through the forest, the pack in close pursuit, but soon trapped at the edge of a cliff towering above the ocean. With the savage dogs closing in, he jumps off the cliff and falls to his death.Lois seeks refuge in the abandoned barn just as a storm hits the island. She lays down in one of the stalls and falls asleep, but when she wakes up, she discovers that the dogs have returned. The dogs growl menacingly before they attack Lois and kill her.Elsewhere, Jerry and Hardiman manage to warn Walker, Dodge, and Marge about the dogs roaming the island and bring them back to the house. But when Jerry arrives at McMinnimee's cabin to warn him, he believes something is wrong when the old man does not respond. He then discovers the dead bodies of Shazah and the collie. After searching the side of the cabin, he finds the old man's lifeless body inside having already been attacked and mauled by the pack. Jerry then leaves McMinnimee's cabin just managing to avoid the pack who had been stalking him. He returns to the house and tells the others of what had happened. He even states that most of the dogs were once tourists' pets, but were abandoned to survive on the island a few weeks earlier. Concerned and outraged that his son Tommy is still out lost on the island, Dodge persuades Jerry to find him. Jerry, accompanied by Dodge and Hardiman, head out to the abandoned barn and find the dogs running away. Dodge, armed with a rifle, shoots and kills a dalmatian as the pack runs off. Inside the barn, the men find Lois' mangled body lying in a corner, but do not find Tommy.Believing that his son is dead, Dodge steals Jerry's jeep and drives off in pursuit of the dogs, with Jerry and Hardiman following him in Hardiman's truck. Dodge soon encounters the pack near one of the abandoned houses, but before he can even shoot at them, the dogs attack him and tear him to shreds. Jerry and Hardiman soon find Dodge and drive off the dogs with their truck, but Dodge succumbs to his injuries and dies the next day. After failing to send a signal out to the Coast Guard on the radio, Jerry orders Millie, Walker and Hardiman to find whatever weapons they can use against the pack, but the only weapons they can find are Jerry's shotgun and a handful of cartridges, a couple of sticks, an umbrella, and a few knives.Later that same day, Jerry, his family, and the few remaining inhabitants find themselves under siege by the pack. Later that afternoon, the mongrel and four other dogs from the pack launch an attack on the house, trying to break in through the windows. Jerry, Millie, their sons, and Hardiman struggle to hold them off. Two of the dogs, a Doberman Pinscher and an Irish setter, manage to break inside the house, but Jerry kills the setter with his shotgun and Walker and Jerry's dog Riley drive the Doberman out of the house. The rest of the dogs flee after failing to break through the windows.Realizing that the dogs will return for another assault, Jerry tells his family, Marge, Hardiman and Walker to board up the windows and doors of the house. Later that night, the group carries Dodge's body down to the docks and place him in a boat, pushing it out to sea to prevent the pack from trying to get at it. Knowing that the dogs will be back, they then quickly return to the house and lock themselves inside.The following morning, Walker wakes up and hears the sound of a motorboat near the docks. He grabs Jerry's shotgun and runs down to the docks to find a small group of people in a motorboat several yards out at sea. He fires a shot in the air, trying to signal them to land at the docks, but the people believe he is messing around and they laugh and drive away. Walker turns around, only to find the dogs standing in his way. He fights them off with the gun, but the mongrel and two other dogs quickly overpower him and knock him off the deck into the water.Meanwhile, Jerry, having heard the sound of the shotgun being fired and realizing that Walker has headed down to the docks, takes his jeep and drives down there, only to find him surrounded by the pack. As Jerry drives his vehicle onto the dock, the dogs turn their attention towards Jerry and charge him. The moving jeep runs over the pack, killing a gray terrier mongrel and forcing the rest of the dogs to retreat into the forest. Jerry pulls Walker out of the water and drives him back to the house.Tired of waiting for help, Jerry orders Millie to take Marge, Riley, Walker, and their sons out to the docks, while he and Hardiman would try to finish off the pack. While Hardiman waits quietly in Jerry's jeep, Jerry lures the mongrel and the remainder of his pack into the house. As soon as the dogs are all inside, Hardiman closes the door behind them, pours several bucket-loads of gasoline on the walls, and sets the house on fire with a torch. Jerry then climbs up the ladder to the attic and tries to raise it to prevent the dogs from following him, but the mongrel leaps on top of the ladder and manages to reach the top. Jerry holds him off for a short while, but as the flames reach the floor of the attic, he pushes the dog back and jumps through a window, sliding off the roof and lands on the grass below. The mongrel leaps out of the same window and springs at Jerry, but he misses his aim and is embedded on the sharpened end of a broken pipe.Millie and the others return to the house and watch as the burning building explodes and collapses, killing all the dogs inside. They soon discover that one of the dogs, the same dog from the opening scene that was abandoned and had joined the pack a few days earlier, had apparently did not join the fate of his comrades because the rope he was tied to had been caught and tangled in a heavy branch. Jerry, realizing that the dog was apparently afraid and not as savage and aggressive as the other dogs, decides to try to tame it. Using some crackers, he feeds them one by one to the dog. The film ends as the dog starts licking Jerry's hand, apparently winning the trust of the man and becoming a pet again."

As family matriarch Lena Gogan (Shelley Winters) and company attempt to lure him back (""The Happiest Home in These Hills""), an unseen force, which Pete calls Elliott, distracts the Gogans by knocking Willie (Jeff Conaway) and the rest of the family into the mud. Frustrated, the Gogans resume their search elsewhere, since they spent their savings on ""buying"" Pete and can't afford to adopt another orphan.The next morning, Pete and Elliott, who is revealed to be a large green and purple dragon, share breakfast in an apple orchard (""Boo Bop BopBop Bop (I Love You, Too)""). The pair decide to go to a nearby fishing village, Passamaquoddy. Unfortunately, the unseen Elliott makes his presence known by knocking over things and making footprints in wet cement. Pete is immediately labeled a source of ill luck and is forced to flee. Nearby, Lampie (Mickey Rooney) stumbles out of a tavern and encounters Pete. Elliott decides to make himself visible and playfully scare Lampie, much to the disgust of Pete. Panicked, Lampie runs back into the bar to warn the townsfolk, who take his rantings as a drunken delusion (""I Saw a Dragon""). Nora (Helen Reddy), Lampie's headstrong daughter, comes looking for him and gets swept up in the tavern's lampooning. Nora takes Lampie back to their home, the Passamaquoddy lighthouse, and settles him down. After putting Lampie to bed, she spies a young boy, Pete, walking along the beach and decides to investigate.Pete and Elliott sit in a cave near the lighthouse, where Pete rebukes Elliott for causing trouble and worries about his own future. The two make up just as Pete is discovered by Nora, who invites him into the lighthouse for the night. There, he explains his history and how Elliott rescued him from the Gogans (""It's Not Easy""). As they talk, Pete sees a picture of a sailor and asks who it is. Nora explains that it is her fiancé Paul, whose ship has been missing for a long time. Pete tells her that he will ask Elliott about Paul, because he [Elliott] has a way of knowing things. Nora believes Elliott to be an imaginary friend, and that Pete is trying to cheer her up, so she pretends to believe that Elliott will help her.Doc Terminus (Jim Dale), a snake-oil salesman, and his shill Hoagie (Red Buttons), fleeing from pursuers, arrive in Passamaquoddy. The town's population, who have been visited by Terminus before, are initially angered by his return. But, thanks to his clever salesmanship, Terminus is able to calm the mob (""Passamashloddy"") and sets up shop to sell more of his wares. Meanwhile, Nora has taken Pete to buy some new clothes. That evening, Pete asks to go to the cave to show Elliott his new suit and to take Paul's picture so Elliott can help find him. Both agree, with Lampie adding that Elliott isn't allowed in the lighthouse. Nora thanks her father for pretending that the dragon exists, but Lampie insists he actually saw a dragon. Nora tells him to be realistic, to which Lampie retorts that Nora has been holding out hope for Paul's return, something nobody else expects to happen. Lampie apologizes for his outburst and excuses himself, giving Nora time to think (""Candle on the Water"").As Terminus and Hoagie ""treat"" the townsfolk in the tavern, Lampie drunkenly stumbles up and tells them both about the dragon. Terminus dismisses the tale, but Hoagie, just as drunk as Lampie, agrees to go with Lampie to the cave. In the cave, Elliott observes the duo as they frighten themselves with exaggerated descriptions of a terrifying monster. Fearful himself, and not realizing they are describing him, Elliott joins them as they explore, to the shock of Hoagie and Lampie. After all three face each other, Hoagie offers Elliott some liquor as a gesture of peace. The alcohol, however, triggers a fiery belch from his mouth that chases both men out of the cave.Nora escorts Pete to school, while the local fishermen complain about the recent scarcity of fish, and upon seeing Pete believe he is the cause. Nora angrily reminds them the fishing grounds shift at times, and that ""There's Room For Everyone"" in town, even Pete and his ""dragon."" At the schoolhouse, Miss Taylor is wary of accepting Pete as a new student, but relents. During the lessons, the invisible Elliott begins ringing the school bell. As Pete tries to stop Elliott, Miss Taylor sees Pete on the bell's rope and thinks that he is ringing it. Miss Taylor punishes Pete for lying, which enrages Elliott, who smashes into the building, leaving dragon-shaped holes in the walls. Doc Terminus, hearing the ruckus, sees the damage and realizes the dragon is quite real. He discovers that dragons have a lot of uses (""Every Little Piece"") and hatches a plot to buy Elliott from Pete.At the lighthouse, Terminus makes Pete an offer for Elliott, which Pete refuses since he doesn't ""own"" Elliott. The two crooks are subsequently chased away by Nora's foghorn. Afterwards, Nora reveals to Pete that she and Lampie would like for Pete to stay with them, so that Pete can ""stop running"" and live a normal life. Gratefully, Pete accepts their offer (""Brazzle Dazzle Day""). Unfortunately, the Gogans arrive in Passamaquoddy, still searching for Pete. They ask Hoagie if he knows a Pete, one that always talks about a dragon. Nearby townsfolk react to the question, telling them this is where Pete is. The Gogans find Pete with Nora and Lampie by the wharf (""Bill of Sale""), but Elliott arrives in time to save the day. Terminus later visits the Gogans, convincing them that he will give them Pete if they help him capture Elliott. He then gathers allies among the superstitious who take the dragon as a sign of misfortune and prepares a trap.That evening, a storm starts to blow in. Elliott tells Pete he has located Paul. Pete tries to tell Nora the good news; however, Nora, still believing that Pete has made up Elliott, says that since Pete has a new home, it was time both of them became more realistic so they could move on. Even Lampie begins to doubt that he saw a dragon. Pete, however, is largely undeterred, and he helps Nora prepare the lighthouse for the storm. Out at sea, a sailing ship is heading for Passamaquoddy. The ship's captain is assisted by none other than Paul, who knows the local waters, as well as the lighthouse-keepers.Terminus comes to the lighthouse and lures Pete to the town's boathouse, while the frightened Hoagie does the same to Elliott. At the boathouse, Elliott discovers Pete just as Terminus springs his trap. Elliott is able to break free and rescues Pete from the Gogans before they can escape. In a last effort, Lena Gogan shows Elliott the bill of sale that declares her Pete's legal guardian. Elliott sets the paper on fire, tips Lena Gogan into a barrel of creosote, and chases off the family's carriage horse. As Pete and Elliott celebrate, Terminus aims a large harpoon gun at the distracted dragon. He is about to fire when he realizes that the harpoon's rope is looped around his ankle. He diverts the cannon, but is unable to stop it from shooting him through the ceiling. The harpoon lands in a pole, leaving Terminus dangling and, with his wagon destroyed, out of business. As they prepare to leave, Elliott sees a utility pole start to fall towards the town hall, just as the mayor, Miss Taylor and the town council are exiting. Elliott, now visible, catches the pole and saves them, much to their surprise.Off the coast, a ship is headed for the jagged rocks of a reef. The Passamaquoddy lighthouse has been hit by a monstrous wave that shattered the lantern room windows, drenching the oil-burning lamp, and Lampie cannot find a dry wick. Elliott arrives just in time to light the lamp with his own fire. As he is trying to do so, Nora comes in and is astonished by his presence. After several failures, the light is ignited and the ship is saved.The saving of the ship enables Elliott to become accepted by the townspeople as a heroic figure or guardian. The economy prospers, and the mayor is humbled. Nora's love Paul returns, the sole survivor of the wreck of which Nora was informed earlier. It is revealed that Paul had lost his memory until an intervention by Elliott restored it, and shown that he was aboard the ship saved during the previous night.Elliott, however, has sad news: because Pete is now safe and has a loving family of his own, the dragon must move on to help other children. Pete and Elliott say their goodbyes, and Elliott flies off to his next task, with Pete reminding him to remain invisible. A reprise of the line ""There really is a dragon"" is provided by Paul."
tt0076574,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'R']","Providence (no spoilers)CLIVE Langham (played by John Gielguld) is an old writer with health problems who still enjoys the gifts of life, as his gusto of his daily white wine. He is a storyteller and he tells us of his family, especially of his sons. He has two sons: one is CLAUDE Langham, the official one, a successful lawyer (played by Dirk Bogarde), the other KEVIN Langham or Kevin Woodford (played by David Warner) his illegitimate son, remembrance of some past relationship he is not sure of.But the way CLIVE, the author, changes several times in his storytelling the behaviors of his siblings makes us gradually suspect they are only characters in his story, the creatures of his writer's imagination, products of his writer's block, his hopes, his hesitations or angst, and finally tells us of the joys, humor and suffering of the whole creating process in writing a novel. Nevertheless CLIVE has to comply to one of the very few rules of dramatic writing which states there is no story without conflicts, and therefore feels compelled to give his characters antagonism, some educated aggressiveness, and the more often than sometimes sex-obsessed image of cynical people entangled in their neurotic denials with uneven bravados on the surface, the whole being spiced with insistence and English humor. In his storytelling, CLIVE acts as master of the world, but when his characters resist his demiurgic wanton caprices and vagaries, he complains they give him a hectic time and he rants it's them who build up his anger against them, so he is the one who has to change them.This is how, sometimes, after being told once, a scene turns out to be only a draft and has to be replayed. So we see it again, as CLIVE finds other behaviors and other dialogs over the same characters predicaments and commitments, that would fit his scheme and his pleasure. The same can happen to a background, a door, a passing extra. They can be altered, displaced, transformed, appear or disappear on sight, as the mood of the characters or of the scene changes, or as CLIVE's whims meddle in.As CLIVE's point of view is preeminent in the storytelling, Alain RESNAIS brilliantly stages CLIVE's complex behavior by using different parts of the house in a different way. The BEDROOM from which CLIVE speaks can be said to be his SELF with both CLIVE's doubts and certainties over his work. The back of the house, its BACK TERRACE, where most of the strange changes occur, is undoubtly his SUBCONSCIOUS, his backstage, subject to CLIVEs fantasy, to his fancies and whims, and logic uncommon. But the FRONT of the house will be back to REALITY and will cloture the story.Other different sets occur as backgrounds but they are inside the story being told and can be modified at will by CLIVE.But then, IN REALITY, his family finally arrives for his birthday, and CLIVE welcomes them on the FRONT lawn for lunch. They are perfectly normal and even quite sympathetic people, getting along with each other, and not the embittered, devious players CLIVE described earlier in his story. Peace at last.After all, this is a secret comedy about life, all in the way it is told - and John Gielguld's best experience as he stated it.-------------

tt0076590,"['Horror', 'SciFi']","Rose (Marilyn Chambers) and her boyfriend Hart (Frank Moore) are taking a little spin in the Quebec countryside on Hart's motorcycle when they have an accident. A family in a camper van stops in the middle of the road to argue about directions, and Hart must swerve to avoid them, going off the road and crashing. A patient at the nearby Keloid Clinc for Plastic Surgery witnesses the accident and calls for an ambulance. At the clinic, Murray Cypher (Joe Silver) pitches a promising franchising deal to Dr. Dan Keloid (Howard Ryshpan) and his wife Roxanne (Patricia Gage). Keloid is unconvinced, afraid that he'll become the ""Colonel Sanders of plastic surgery"". Just then, an ambulance containing Hart and Rose arrives. Hart has a broken hand, separated shoulder, and a concussion, but Rose, having been pinned under the motorcycle, is more severely injured. Dr. Keloid recognizes that Rose needs immediate surgery and decides to perform a radical procedure on her, one which uses morphogenetically neutral grafts of her own skin to patch the injured tissues in and on her chest and abdomen. The treated skin will be able to form new tissue of whatever type it is grafted to, but it also might lead to cancer.A month or two passes. Hart has already gone home to Montreal, but Rose still remains in a coma at the Keloid Clinic. Then one night, one of the other patients, Lloyd Walsh (J. Roger Periad), hears Rose screaming and goes to her room. She has awakened and is pulling out her I.V. drip tube. In an attempt to warm her and calm her down, Lloyd holds her, and Rose causes some sort of vague injury to him as she holds him. When examined a few hours later, Lloyd can't remember anything afterwards, and the doctor doesn't know what caused his injury to his right arm. They know only that his blood isn't clotting from the small wound and that Lloyd's right side has no feeling. Dr. Keloid thinks that it might have been a mild stroke and transfers him to Montreal General Hospital for further evaluation.Over the next few days, Rose leaves the clinic periodically to feed; her experimental procedures have caused a wild card mutation in her body, and now the only thing she can subsist on is human blood. To help her attain it, a bizarre new organ has developed in Rose's armpit; through a small sphincter opening, a large red phallic spike emerges to pierce her victims and draw blood like a syringe. First she feeds on a cow in the barn of a nearby farm, but she vomits up the blood, realizing that she needs only human blood, so she feeds instead on the drunken farmer who wanders into the barn. The next night, Rose attacks a young nurse in a hot tub, and then hides her unconscious body in a freezer.The next day, Lloyd discharges himself from the clinic. He hails a taxi to take him to the airport. But during the trip, Lloyd, already looking deathly pale, transforms into a foaming, green-eye zombie-like person and attacks the driver, biting out part of his neck making the driver lose control of the car. The taxi breaks through a bridge guardrail and the car falls to the freeway below where it is totaled by an approaching truck, killing both the driver and the infected Lloyd.At the clinic, Dr. Keloid is examining the unconscious Rose. He notices the strange opening under her arm, but Rose wakes up and the phallic syringe emerges and strikes him in the hand.At a nearby diner, the farmer, infected the previous night by Rose, walks in, bleeding from his left eyeball where Rose's stuck the phallic thing, and after asking for chicken, he attacks and bites a waitress before he is subdued by the cook and a few patrons.At the clinic, Rose phones Hart to come to her aid, for she feels that she's in trouble. Hart calls Murray Cypher to tag along with him. Later that day, Dr. Keloid goes into the O.R. to operate on a patient when he suddenly begins foaming at the mouth and also transforms into a green-eyed zombie who proceeds to hack off a nurse's finger with surgical scissors and drinks her blood. A few orderlies attack back at the vicious Dr. Keloid, as Rose takes advantage of the chaos and confusion to make her escape from the clinic. She hitches a ride to Montreal from a passing truck driver, who has food in the cab of his truck. After he offers some to the famished Rose, she eats it and it seems to satisfy her momentarily, but she then vomits it back up, eventually feeding on the driver as she has done to the others.Hart and Murray pass the diner where the infected farmer attacked the waitress, and then arrive at the clinic to find more police cars and a rabid and vicious looking Dr. Keloid in the back of a police van, growling and foaming at the mouth. The police tell Murray and Hart that they think it's a new strain of rabies. Hart panics when he learns that a body was found in a freezer, but to his slight relief, it's the nurse that Rose killed in the hot tub.Meanwhile, Rose hitches a ride with another car driver, leaving behind the unconscious truck driver whom is infected. He is woken up by a highway patrolman and goes on his way. The trucker returns that night to a depot where he transforms and attacks his colleagues at the place, infecting some of them before being subdued.At the police station, the chief of police, Claude LePointe, meets with Hart, Murray and a few public health officials who talk of an epidemic. Just then, as Hart and Murray watch a TV broadcast of various other reports of attacks, an officer, who was apparently bitten by the infected Dr. Keloid at the clinic, appears growling and foaming at the mouth. The infected officer attacks Hart only to be shot dead by the other officers. To stop the disease from progressing, everyone at the scene, including Hart and Murray, are to be held at the police station for 48 hours. Hart calls Mindy Kent (Susan Roman) who is Rose's best friend, and is pleased to hear that Rose has been in touch with her. Over the phone, Hart tells Mindy to keep Rose at her apartment until he can get there.Meanwhile, Rose arrives in Montreal, meets with Mindy, and asks to stay with her in her apartment for a few days, but refuses to explain why. Mindy watches another TV broadcast detailing a new strain of lethal rabies that is now reporting all over Montreal. That night, Rose goes out to the local red-light district and visits a sex cinema. A leering patron sits next to her to fondle her, only to become a victim himself.The next day, Claude LePointe is riding in a limo with a local health official to inform the mayor that the situation is getting out of control. Just then, the limo is blocked at a construction sight, and two infected crewmen attack, putting a jackhammer through the limo door and dragging the shocked driver, whose thigh was injured by the jackhammer, out to feed on him, while the official and LePointe are forced to leave their driver for dead as they barely escape by driving themselves away in reverse.Elsewhere, Mindy is riding on a subway train when an infected woman attacks another passenger, causing panic and forcing Mindy and the rest of the passengers to flee after the train arrives at the station.On TV, Dr. Royce Gentry talks about the dozens of rabies cases popping up all over the city, and advises a ""shoot-to-kill"" policy to prevent the infected from infecting others. Rose goes out to a local shopping mall filled with Christmas shoppers. Another leering man approaches her to make small talk, and to try to pick her up. As Rose agrees to walk with him, he asks her for a light, but she tells him that she doesn't smoke. The man asks another man standing nearby for a light, and the man turns around... an infected zombie who proceeds to bite and infect the man Rose is with. Panic breaks out in the mall as two armed security guards appear and shoot the infected man dead, as well as an unfortunate man dressed as Santa. The guards shoot the wounded man who tried to pick up Rose as well, since he is now infected. Rose again slips away unnoticed.When Mindy arrives home, Rose hides in her room, in blood-hunger. She tells Mindy not to come into her room for she is not feeling well. Meanwhile, extreme martial law is declared in Montreal and all the surrounding areas. Dr. Royce Gentry makes another TV appearance to announce that the current rabies shots don't appear to be working. But he and his men have developed a vaccine to administer to those not infected with the virus. Those already infected, however, must be killed to prevent the epidemic from spreading any further.At a National Guard road block to check for people infected, Hart and Murray view a long convoy of soldiers in NBC suits and riding on garbage trucks heading into the city to assist the local authorities with the body disposal. Hart then takes Murray home and drives off in Murray's car to look for Rose. When Murray walks in his house, he finds his baby dead and is attacked by his now-infected wife. Whether Murray is killed or survives albeit ending up infected himself is unknown.As Hart drives through the deserted city, a infected maniac jumps on the car, but is shot dead by a militia marksman. Soldiers in bio-warfare suits remove the infected man's body to dump it into the nearby garbage truck and spray disinfectant on the windshield and permit him to carry on his way.At Mindy's apartment, she watches a news report about a possible ""carrier"" of this lethal disease which has now been traced back to the Keloid Clinic, who is possibly immune. Rose walks into the room. A little later, Hart arrives to find Rose feasting on Mindy's body. Hart finally realizes that Rose is the carrier of the virus and tries to reason with her to seek treatment, but Rose refuses to believe him. She is in denial that she is feasting on blood and the one responsible for the city-wide epidemic that has now claimed thousands of people. She tries to run, but he chases after her. In a struggle, Hart falls down a fire escape ladder and is knocked out. Rose runs into the apartment building lobby, where she picks up another man in the lobby and has him take her back to his apartment.To see if Hart's accusations are true, Rose infects the guy with her phallic piece and then locks herself in the man's apartment and intends to stay there until she can see whether or not he becomes sick. Rose dials Mindy's phone number, and Hart stumbles back into the apartment to answer it. Rose tells Hart what she is doing, but he knows what will happen and frantically tells her to get out of the man's apartment. Hart sits helplessly at the receiver, which he smashes, as the infected man in his apartment wakes up, growling and foaming at the mouth, and approaches Rose....The next morning, Montreal is nearly deserted. The streets are quiet except for distant gunfire and the sound of police and ambulance sirens. Soldiers in bio-ware suits find Rose's stiff, open-eyed body, laying next to some garbage cans in an alley. The body collectors pick up her body, toss it in the back of a garbage truck, and drive away, not realizing that she is the carrier of the virus.... and possibly the solution and antidote to the mayhem that continues to plague the city.[Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

The bottle is the carried away by the waters, and after some time, arrives along the shores of New York City, where several mice find it.The bottle is then brought before the International Rescue Aid Society, an organization of mice that gathers inside a luxury suitcase in the basement of the United Nations building. Inside is a note that is recovered by a janitorial mouse named Mr Bernard. After spreading out the message, the Chairman and the Hungarian representative named Miss Bianca then read over the message:""To Morning Side Orphanage, New YorkI am in terrible trouble. Please hurry. Help!Penny.""Miss Bianca volunteers to help the little girl, and the Chairman allows her to choose any of the delegates to assist her. To their surprise, Bianca chooses the janitor Bernard. Mr. Chairman is surprised but has no objection, and soon the pair is off to search for clues.Taking a clue from the letter, they head to the Morning Side Orphanage. Searching through the rooms, they eventually find a box with Penny's name on it, along with other belongings. Wondering about why her items would be boxed up, they are interrupted by Rufus, an old cat. At first apprehensive, they soon strike a conversation with Rufus about Penny. Rufus explains about the last time he saw Penny before she disappeared, but also says that since there are no other clues, the Police have since given up the search.Rufus explains to Bernard that even though the girl had appeared to be very happy, the next thing he'd heard was that she had disappeared. Bernard finds it hard to believe that Penny would simply take off, and asks for any further information that Rufus may have for them. Though he hesitates for a moment, Rufus explains about the mysterious involvement of a ""trashy lady,"" whom had offered to take Penny for a ride in her car. He tells them that this woman and her partner run a pawn shop nearby. Bernard and Miss Bianca set off for the place, but Rufus reminds them that even if they were to locate Penny, there isn't much that two little mice will be able to do.Bernard and Miss Bianca arrive at Madame Medusa's pawn shop. A seemingly harmless, yet intimidating, locale full of antiques, diamonds, jewelry and countless other objects. They begin to search the owner's office and backroom, where they discover a first-grade child's writing book, with the name ""Penny"" written on its cover; Bernard is certain that they've come to the right place to look for clues. The silence is broken first by the sound of a wall cuckoo clock, which succeeds in startling the mouse heroes, and then by that of a telephone ringing, which manages to frighten the two mice, sending them both for cover. The phone continues to ring, and within moments, the store's owner appears thundering through the back door. The woman, annoyed at being called in the middle of the night, answers the phone: ""Madame Medusa's pawn shop boutique!"" As the two mice listen, they learn that it is a call from someone named Mr. Snoops. As the conversation unravels, they learn that Mr. Snoops has not been able to locate a diamond, to Madame's great dismay, and also that Penny has been sending messages in bottles. Madame Medusa is enfuriated when she hears this and announces that she'll soon be on her way to the Devil's Bayou. The two mice manage to climb into her convertible, but are thrown out of the vehicle after a wild, reckless ride through the quiet streets of New York City. Bernard and Miss Bianca are left feeling helpless on the sidewalk in the middle of the night.The two mice arrive at a New York City airport some time later. Bernard begs Miss Bianca to hurry, since he believes Madame Medusa has already arrived at Devil's Bayou. The two make their way to the headquaters of Albatross Airlines and await there for their flight. Upon looking at a blackboard with information regarding the flight hours to Devil's Bayou, Bernard is dismayed to discover that they've missed their flight by a quarter of an hour. Miss Bianca comforts him by reminding him that flights tend to be late. Moments later, over the intercom, they hear the announcement for flight 13, headed for Devil's Bayou. Bernard is anything but thrilled when he learns that he'll be flying on the flight marked with the dreaded number 13. Orville the albatross attempts to communicate with the control tower, but no one is present to answer his call. Bernard contacts him and with the help of Miss Bianca, gives Orville the required permission to land safely. Miss Bianca watches with excitement as Orville makes his appearance, flying gracefully and then landing face first on the runway. Bernard runs down to greet Orville and asks him if he is hurt. Orville shakes the dust off his feathers and proudly announces that one to be one of his better landings, which does nothing to help Bernard's fear of flying aboard him."
tt0076666,"['Drama', 'Music']","In the opening scene, we are introduced to Anthony ""Tony"" Manero (John Travolta), a 19-year old Italian American living in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City. He swaggers through Bay Ridge on his way to work at a local hardware store. His boss, Dan Fusco (Sam Coppola), likes that Tony charms customers, but he refuses the young man's request for an advance.At home, Tony lives with his parents; his alcoholic, abusive and unemployed father Frank Sr. (Val Bisoglio), his uneducated and overbearing mother Flo (Julie Bovasso), his non-English speaking Grandmother (Nina Hansen) and his younger sister Linda (Lisa Peluso). Tony primps to go out that Friday evening and then rushes through dinner with his family, all of whom compare him unfavorably to his older brother, Frank, Jr., a Catholic priest.After dinner, Tony meets outside his house with four close friends that he goes out every Friday night. His friends are Joey (Joseph Cali); Double J (Paul Pape); Gus (Bruce Ornstein); and the diminutive Bobby C. (Barry Miller). Another informal member of their group is Annette (Donna Pescow), a neighborhood girl who longs for a more permanent and physical relationship with Tony. They all drive in Bobby C.'s car to the 2001 Odyssey discotheque.Crowded and pulsing with music, the Odyssey is where Tony and his friends spend their weekends and their paychecks. Annette, who is a frequent regular at the disco, asks Tony to dance, but he squashes her romantic notions. Later, Tony notices a new girl, Stephanie Mangano (Karen Lynn Gorney) on the dance floor. He retreats to the bar/lounge area in the club where Annette joins him, suggesting they be partners for the club's upcoming dance competition. Tony makes it clear they will need to practice often, and the partnership is strictly about dancing, not dating. Joey interrupts because he wants Tony to get Double J. out of the car, where he is having sex with a girl whose name he does not know.(Note: One plot device in the story is the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which connects from Long Island to Staten Island, on which the friends ritually stop to clown around, but is particularly symbolic to Tony as an escape to a better life on the other side, in more suburban Staten Island.)The next Saturday morning, the five young men express their cynical views of the future, but Tony learns Fusco has given him a raise. That night, Tony's abusive father dismisses the pay increase and Tony angrily points out that the raise and the attention he gets for his dancing are the only positive acknowledgments he has ever received.Later that evening, Tony meets Annette at a dance studio and she offers to make love with him, but Tony again insists the relationship remain platonic. When Tony notices Stephanie practicing in another room, he chases off Annette, but Stephanie is cool toward him. Returning home, Tony finds his family somber as Frank, Jr., the priest, has returned to announce that he is leaving the church.The next day, Tony is energized and invites Stephanie for coffee at a local diner. She tells him she is not interested in him romantically, pointing out their six-month age difference (she is the older one at age 20) and the cultural superiority she feels because she works in New York City at a public relations firm. She agrees to be Tony's partner in the dance competition, but will not date him because he is immature and his life is going nowhere. Tony tells her that he wants to find other ways to experience the high he feels from dancing because the thrill will not last forever.Later, Tony's friends inform him that Gus is in the hospital after being beaten by a Hispanic gang, the Barracudas. Bobby C. announces that he is getting married, but Tony dismisses the idea. He later informs Annette that he has found another dance partner for the competition.At the rehearsal studio, Tony and Stephanie begin to click, but when Stephanie again declines Tony's invitation to coffee, he deems her pretentious. When Tony presses to know why they never discuss the romantic feelings that emerge from their dancing, Stephanie says he should have seduced without asking permission first.Another evening or two later, Tony and his friends bring Frank, Jr., to the discotheque. While Bobby C. confides to Frank, Jr. that his girlfriend is pregnant, Tony dances solo (to the showstopping tune of the Bee Gee's 'You Should Be Dancing') and the crowd clears the floor in appreciation. Frank, Jr., is impressed by his brother's talent. Afterward, Tony is annoyed to learn from the doorman that Stephanie has not arrived. Annette corners Tony and suggests they can be lovers now that they are not dance partners, but Tony dismisses the idea until she threatens to have sex with one of his friends, instead. Tony escorts Annette to Bobby's car, but their revelry is cut short when he discovers she is not using birth control.A little later, the boys and Annette drive to the Verrazano Narrows Bridge. Tony, Joey, and Double J. climb the support cables and pretend to fall, frightening Annette.In the morning, a car arrives to take Frank, Jr. to a settlement house until he figures out his next move. He counsels Tony to pursue his dream of dancing and not let the family limit his dreams.Later, at the studio, Tony chides Stephanie for not going to the discotheque the previous night. After rehearsing, they join Tony's friends for burgers and the boys' rowdy behavior embarrasses Tony. Bobby C. hypothetically asks Stephanie what she would do if she was his pregnant girlfriend, and she says she would choose an abortion over marriage. Her opinion moves the Catholic Bobby C. the wrong way.The next day, Tony's boss refuses the boy's request for the day off, and when Tony takes the day off anyway, he is fired. Tony borrows Bobby C.'s car and promises to call his friend later. Tony drives to nearby Manhattan and helps Stephanie move into her new New York City townhouse. An older man, named Jay Langhart, is moving out. He kisses Stephanie and tells her to keep the furniture since she picked it out. Alone with Stephanie, Tony asks what is going on and she confesses to having an affair with Jay to boost her career. Upset, Stephanie asks Tony to take her back to Bay Ridge, but Tony instead takes her to Shore Park, where he comforts her and demonstrates his extensive knowledge of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge.Afterward, Tony returns to the hardware store and Fusco reluctantly gives him back his job, promising the boy a prosperous future. However, Tony observes the men who have worked there for years and is unnerved. Later, Tony finds Stephanie dancing with Pete, the owner of the studio, and leaves, enraged.Outside the 2001 Odyssey, Annette shows Tony a handful of condoms, but he walks away and Annette is crushed.Tony, Bobby C., Double J., and Joey stake out the Barracudas hideout, and Bobby C. tries to tell Tony he has decided to marry pregnant Pauline. Double J. grabs the wheel of Bobby C.'s car and crashes into the clubhouse. A fight ensues with the Barracudas and although Bobby C. hides in the car, he is attacked. Bobby C. puts the car in reverse and drives away. Tony is badly beaten, but Double J. and Joey drag him outside just as Bobby C. returns; however, his friends are angry he left. Tony and the others visit Gus in the hospital only to learn that he is not sure if the Barracudas beat him after all, and that they may have targeted the wrong gang.The following evening, cleaned up from the fight, the friends return to the discotheque for the dance competition. An African American couple takes the floor and is treated rudely by the racist audience. Meanwhile, Annette asks Joey for amphetamines. Tony and Stephanie perform the hustle (to the tune of the Bee Gee's 'More Than A Woman'), during which they share a kiss, and the crowd roars its approval. Next, a Puerto Rican couple dances extremely well with a Mambo dance, impressing Tony and most of the crowd, but there are scattered jeers. The judges award first place to Tony and Stephanie, followed by the Puerto Ricans. However, Tony is convinced the other couple deserved to win and he accuses his friends of hypocrisy and racism. Tony gives the trophy and prize money to the other Hispanic couple and takes Stephanie outside to Bobby C.'s car. She rebuffs his sexual advances and they argue. Tony tries to force himself on her and she flees.Double J., Joey, Bobby C. and an intoxicated Annette join Tony in the car. As they drive around Bay Ridge, Joey has sex with Annette in the backseat. Double J switches places with Joey and when Annette realizes that Tony is not going to stop his friends, she begins to cry. At the bridge, Joey and Double J. begin climbing on the support beams as Bobby C. watches. In the car, Tony asks Annette if she really wanted to be treated this way. Intoxicated, Bobby C. joins Joey and Double J. on the beams and Tony tries to talk him down, but Bobby C. rebukes Tony for failing to call him the day of Stephanie's move. Then Bobby C. slips and falls to his death. On the shore near the bridge, the police interrogate the friends.Alienated with his friends and life in general, Tony leaves on foot and rides the subway until morning. In New York City, Tony visits Stephanie's new apartment. Through the door, he apologizes and she reluctantly invites him in. Tony announces that he is not going back to Bay Ridge and that he intends to get a job in the city. Stephanie is wary, but confesses she enjoyed Tony's admiration and respect. They agree to be friends. They share a warm embrace as the film comes to an end."

tt0076683,"['Horror', 'contentRating', 'R']","In northern Italy, a group of Roman Catholic clerics led by a shadowy robed figure (Jose Ferrer) meet and Monsignor Franchino (Arthur Kennedy) portends danger.Meanwhile, in New York City, elite fashion model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) seeks her own apartment, but her boyfriend, lawyer Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon), wants to get married.In Baltimore, Maryland, Alison's father dies suddenly and she returns home, where she recalls being so traumatized from walking in on her father participating in an orgy that she attempted suicide. She collects a cross that her father tore from her neck during the incident. Alison's mother tells her she stayed with Mr. Parker because she had nowhere else to go.Back in New York City, Alison meets with real estate agent Miss Logan (Ava Gardner) who shows her a ""perfect"" apartment to rent. Alison rents a furnished apartment in Brooklyn Heights. On the top floor of the building lives a blind, senile priest named Father Halliran (John Carradine), who stares blankly out of his window.After fainting during a photo shoot, Alison is visited by an eccentric neighbor, Charles Chazen (Burgess Meredith), who drops by with his pet cat and bird and tells Alison about the other tenants in the building. When he leaves, she notices a photograph of Charles in her apartment. That night, at a party in the apartment, Michael again presses Alison for marriage.In the morning, Alison meets two more neighbors, the wisecracking Gerde (Sylvia Miles) and the mute Sandra (Beverly D'Angelo), who are lovers.At a commercial shoot, Alison again collapses, frustrating Jack (Jeff Goldblum) the photographer.Charles throws a birthday party for his cat and Alison meets more of her strange neighbors. Later, she has a disturbing dream and is awakened by noise from the supposedly empty apartment above her.Alison meets with Miss Logan and learns that aside from the priest, the apartment building has been empty for years and the building is owned by the Holy Diocese of New York. Meanwhile, Father Halliran is visited by Monsignor Franchino. (In some versions, Franchino meets with a group of priests who are a secret order to protecting the world from evil to give them an update them on the events unfolding.) Elsewhere, Michael Lerman asks private investigator James Brenner (Hank Garrett) to check out Alison's building.Alone the next night, Alison hears more noises and investigates. She sees Chazen's cat eating the pet bird and is pursued by an apparition of her father, whom she stabs repeatedly. Alison flees into the street, where she is found, covered in blood, by residents of nearby buildings. The next day, two police detectives, the veteran Gatz (Eli Wallach) and his rookie partner Rizzo (Christopher Walken), visit Michael and question him about his dead wife Karen's suicide and a second suicide attempt by Alison, implying that he is involved in the previous night's incident. Meanwhile, police find nothing suspicious in Alison's apartment and match the blood type on her nightgown to her own.Michael discovers that Mrs. Clark, one of the supposed guests at Chazen's cat's birthday party, was the name of a convicted murderer, who was executed in 1949. Later, Brenner, the private eye, is found stabbed to death in his car and his blood type matches Alison's. Detective Gatz connects Brenner to Michael and suspects that Michael hired the investigator to kill Karen and is now trying to drive her insane. When the detectives arrive at Michael's apartment to confront him, Alison leaves her boyfriend's home for a walk and stops by a Catholic Church. There, she confesses to Monsignor Franchino that she has committed adultery, twice attempted suicide, and is feeling suicidal again. The monsignor assures her that if she embraces Jesus and returns to the church, the feelings will vanish.When Alison returns to Michael's apartment, he suggests that she may not have imagined the events and they visit her apartment in Brooklyn Heights. There is no evidence that Alison killed anyone there, but she says that some of the things in the room, such as the carpet, are different. In a book, Alison sees the same Latin phrase on every page, but Michael only sees English. When Alison writes the text, Michael takes it to Professor Ruzinsky (Martin Balsam), who reports that it is a passage from Milton's Paradise Lost.Alison returns to the church and meets the rector, who tells her he does not know of the priest she claims to have met there earlier. Meanwhile, Michael visits Monsignor Franchino under the pretense that he has a bequest for Father Halliran. Franchino tells him that Halliran has been retired since 1952, suffers from palsy and is unable to accept visitors. Michael shows Franchino the excerpt from Milton, but the monsignor claims not to recognize it. Franchino refuses Michael's request to make a copy of Father Halliran's file. That night, Michael asks Alison's friend, Jennifer (Deborah Raffin), to stay with her while he attends to business.Michael meets a man named Perry (William Hickey), an ex-convict that he represented in the past and bribes him some cash to assist with breaking into the diocese to look at the official files on Halliran. Michael discovers that Father Halliran was originally named Daniel O'Rourke, and, after a suicide attempt, disappeared and re-emerged as Halliran. Michael finds files on several more people who attempted suicide, gained new identities and became priests or nuns and all have lived and died in the very same apartment building in Brooklyn where Alison lives. When one dies, another takes his or her place. A file for Alison states that Halliran will die the very next day and Alison will become a woman named Sister Theresa.Meanwhile, detectives Gatz and Rizzo determine that the eight people Alison claims were at the birthday party for the cat were murderers executed long ago.Michael has Alison attend a party at Jennifer's while he investigates the apartment in Brooklyn Heights. At the party, Alison faints and her friends put her to bed, but at midnight she sneaks away. In Brooklyn Heights, Michael discovers a hidden portal behind a wooden wall of the building which reads: ""Through me you go into the city of grief. Through me you go into the world of pain. Through me you walk among people lost. Abandon hope all yee who enter here"". Father Halliran appears and tells him that this whole building is the entrance to Hell. Michael pursues the priest upstairs and demands answers as he attempts to strangle him.Alison arrives at the building and is met by Michael, who calmly explains that the Latin they found was a warning from the angel Gabriel to the angel Uriel, stationed at the Gateway to Eden. Since that time, a series of sentinels have stood watch, guarding the world against evil. Currently, it is Father Halliran, but that night, Alison is to become the next sentinel upon his passing. The people Alison met in the building, the murderers, were actually reincarnated devils, who could only stop her from becoming the next sentinel by driving her to suicide. Michael goes on to explain that he is dead, killed by Monsignor Franchino minutes earlier for trying to strangle Halliran. He is damned to eternal hell for his sins, including hiring Brenner to murder his wife, Karen. Michael turns his head, revealing a gaping wound, and his head splits open.Alison flees downstairs where Chazen and the demons confront her. She returns upstairs and sees Gerde and Sandra feasting on Michael's dead body. Just then, all of the demons of hell come forth from behind doors and walls. Among the demons, Alison sees her father and Chazen. Cornered by the deformed and hideous demons in Halliran's apartment, Chazen approaches Alison and urges her to join them by killing herself; he gives her a dagger. Franchino and Halliran appear bearing a cross and drive back the demons. Chazen exhorts the demons to fight, but Alison takes the cross. The devils fade back into the walls and the monsignor leads Father Halliran away.The next morning, Gatz and Rizzo arrive at the apartment building where Father Halliran is carried out of the building in a body bag, with the medical examiner's report that he just died of a heart attack. A search of the building leads to no other people around. The building is later demolished.Some time later, Miss Logan, the real estate agent who is still working for the shadowy priesthood in protecting the new apartment building, shows a young couple (Tom Berenger and Nana Tucker) an apartment in the new building. They ask about the neighbors and are told that there are only two: one is a musician and the other is a reclusive blind nun who lives on the top floor. In that apartment, the blind Alison, now known as Sister Theresa, sits silently, wearing a white habit and staring blankly out the window, holding the cross... now the new sentinel and protector of the entrance to Hell."

He returns home one night to discover that his brother Max has committed suicide. Abel meets up with his old boss who gives him some money in an attempt to persuade him back to his now successful circus. Abel realizes he will not be as good as he was with his brother and so declines but his boss allows him to keep the money anyway. The Jewish community is being portrayed in the media as a drain on society. He goes to see his brother's wife Manuela (Liv Ullmann) to break the news of Max's death to her. She asks what triggered Max's suicide, but Abel is unable to provide a solid answer. The only sentence in Max's suicide note Abel can make out reads: ""There is a poisoning going on"". Manuela confesses to Abel that she actually works as a prostitute and merely made up her office job out of shame. November arrives and Germany has become ever more fearful that a bloody confrontation between extremist parties could soon plummet the country into another war.

tt0076715,"['Comedy', 'Crime']","Financial wizard ""Doc"" Fletcher (Michael Caine) persuades his boss, American mobster Joe Fiore (Martin Balsam), to buy up a Swiss bank in order to more easily launder their ill-gotten gains. The impoverished Italian Prince Gianfranco di Siracusa (Louis Jourdan) agrees to act as chairman of the board in order to give it an air of respectability. ""Doc"" goes to Lugano, a major center of banking activity, along with the Don's wayward son Albert (Jay Leno), only to find that the best bank that the Prince could get consists of some shabby offices above a pizza restaurant with assets of $900.To make up for this disappointment, the Prince suggests that they invest in a silver mine recently discovered in Iran by his distant cousins, Agha Firdausi (David Warner) and his sister Shireen (Stéphane Audran). The mine contains hundreds of millions of dollars worth of untapped silver. The Firdausis wish to keep it a secret due to the heavy taxes and the threat of the mine being nationalised by the government. Through a little wheeler-dealing, ""Doc"" manages to obtain $5 million in Iranian rials from Agha as security for a loan of $20 million and uses the money to obtain better banking premises and put on a major show that attracts powerful investors.Before long the Firdausi silver is flooding the market which leads to a drop in its value at the London Metal Exchange. Charlie Cook (Charles Gray), a leading figure in the silver business and one of the richest men in the world, decides that the best way to stop the downward plunge is to take over the bank responsible and thus close down the mine. He contacts Henry Foreman (Joss Ackland), president of the First National Bank of California, who is keen on branching into Europe. Foreman sends one of his accountants, Donald Luckman (Tom Smothers), to Lugano where he meets ""Doc"" and his associates. His questions and evasive attitude makes them suspicious and to find out more ""Doc"" approaches and seduces Donald's fun-loving but bored and neglected wife Debbie (Cybill Shepherd).In the course of their affair, Debbie casually reveals in conversation all about Cook's interest in the mine and the bank. Donald, unaware of what is going on, returns and offers up to $60 million for the bank (which is really worth only about a sixth of the amount). ""Doc"" will have none of it since it means losing everything he has ever worked for, but Albert and Joe Fiore, who actually owns the bank, jump at the opportunity. ""Doc"" goes to Las Vegas and, through a subtle threat, manages to get Joe to give him time to made a bid of his own.""Doc"" and the Prince join the Firdausis at their warehouse in Dubai which is full to the brim with silver bars from the mine. When they tell him that they cannot lend him $60 million to buy the bank, ""Doc"" threatens to call in the earlier loan of $20 million and seize the mine. It's at this point that Agha and Shireen drop a bombshell on their two friends: there is no silver mine!The Firdausis are in fact smugglers who have obtained all their silver from India. The silver mine was just a cover, a means of obtaining the money needed for their operation. ""Doc"" faces a terrible dilemma: if he tells Charlie Cook that the mine does not exist the deal will collapse and ""Doc"" will be killed (literally) by Joe Fiore; but if he does not tell Cook, the deal will go through and ""Doc"" will lose the bank.The deal does go through with Foreman and Donald Luckman sealing it with ""Doc"" and Albert Fiore. In his report on the purchase of the bank Donald has left out all mention of the silver mine, as per the instructions of Foreman and Cook, who was keen to keep it secret. Donald instead put the bank's main assets down as ""oil storage tanks"". Foreman then goes to Cook and demands an exorbitant amount for the silver mine only to be told that it does not exist and that he will thus not be refunded the $60 million used to buy the bank.Foreman can recoup $50 million in insurance since the purchase report mentions non-existent ""oil storage tanks"", thus making a case for fraud. ""Doc"" offers to give Foreman an additional $10 million which he will get from Cook who, in return, will obtain exclusive purchasing rights to the Firdausi silver. In exchange, Foreman gives ""Doc"" the bank which was really only worth $10 million in the first place. Donald then reveals that for the insurance claim to be valid there will have to be a criminal prosecution and a scapegoat will be needed in order to go to prison. The others agree, deciding that it should be the one who falsified the report meaning Donald himself!Some time later, back in Lugano, the Prince marries Shireen Firdausi, even though he was one of those whom she conned into believing in the existence of the mine. Agha does not attend the wedding and Shireen admits that he was in fact an actor she hired since she doubted if a bank would loan $20 million to a woman. ""Doc"" for his part comes across Debbie who has been attending Donald's trial for fraud. She has promised to get a place near the jail in order to be close to him and indicates, with a smile, that ""Doc""'s house is conveniently near the prison itself."
tt0076716,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Family', 'Fantasy']","Sinbad and the Eye of the TigerPrince Kassim (Damien Thomas) is transformed during his coronation as Caliph of the city and kingdom of Charak (1) into a baboon by his stepmother, the witch Queen Zenobia (Margaret Whiting), who wants the throne for her own son, Rafi (Kurt Christian). The Prince's sister, Princess Farah (Jane Seymour), seeks the help of her betrothed, Sinbad (Patrick Wayne), whilst Rafi, disguised as a merchant, tries to kill Sinbad and his crew (one, Aboo Seer (David Sterne) is poisoned) with the aid of three weapon-wielding ghouls (2) (created as stop-motion models, like most of the non-human cast, by Ray Harryhausen) brought from the depths of the earth by his mother's magic: Sinbad crushingly destroys these using falling logs.A discussion the following morning on Sinbads ship between the Princess, her uncle Balsora (Bruno Barnaby), Sinbad and his crew members Hassan (Nadim Sawalha) and Maroof (Salami Coker) discovers that the only possible saviour of Prince Kassim is the Greek sage Melanthius (Patrick Troughton), who lives on the rock-and-reef-ringed fog-bound island of Cascar (3). Zenobia however, having followed Balsora to confront him, learns of their plans. Sinbad and the Princess set sail for Cascar with the enchanted Prince, who astounds the crew by being able to write and play chess. Zenobia, fearing Melanthius may well be able to cure Kassim, decides to follow on a compact bronze boat with Rafi, rowed by their servant, the Minaton (4) (stand-in Peter Mayhew), a colossal bronze minotaur-automaton made by Rafi and animated by Zenobias magic. Balsora's guard on Zenobia, Zabid (Bernard Kay), is capsized and then skewered by the Minaton during their escape.On Cascar, after a brief encounter with rock-tossing inhabitants, Sinbad persuades Melanthius and his daughter Dione (Taryn Power) of the reality of Prince Kassim's condition, and to help: Melanthius reveals that the only cure will be to journey to the land of the former Arimaspi (5) at Hyperborea, a green valley in the polar regions maintained by the Arimaspi's powers, captured in the pyramidal Shrine of the Four Elements there to which he fortunately has the key, map and sailing directions. Speed is of the essence, as not only must Prince Kassim be crowned before seven moons have passed or renounce the Caliphate, but he will also gradually lose his remaining human abilities. However Kassim is befriended by Dione, who brings him fruit and practices writing with him.Zenobia, having been delayed by her boat being damaged when approaching Cascar, transforms herself by means of a magic potion into a seagull to fly to Sinbads ship, and there resumes her human form in miniature to spy out Melanthius plans. Spotted by Kassim, and caught by Melanthius, she learns of the trip to the lands of the Arimaspi, and is able to memorize the map, but when Melanthius uses some of the magic potion on a wasp (6), which grows to a giant size and attacks him, she is able to reclaim the potion vial, escape in seagull form, and return to her own boat. However there is now insufficient potion to effect the reverse transformation, and she retains a seagull's foot. The giant wasp is killed by Sinbad using a thrown dagger.Approaching the icebound polar regions, Sinbad passes by the ice-tunnel to the Arimaspi valley as being too small for his ship, and instead conducts his team on a journey by foot across the ice-pack (with Kassim in his cage on a sled), interrupted by a fight with a giant walrus, in which one crew member falls through the ice and another is stomped flat, to reach the outer part of the warm lands of Hyperborea, where they all relax. By this time Kassim has reverted almost wholly to animal nature, and only responds to Dione. Here the group encounters a giant Troglodyte, who shows them the way to the valley of the Arimaspi pyramid-shrine, and opens the valleys great gates for them. Meanwhile Zenobia, Rafi and the Minaton with their smaller boat have been able to take the ice-tunnel via a ruined temple directly to the shrine, where Zenobia forces an entrance using magic: however a falling stone block destroys the Minaton.Sinbad's party arrives at the now-failing shrine, where giant icicles crash down, and in a fight the baboon Kassim kills Rafi by rolling him down stairs to break his neck. Melanthius successfully restores Prince Kassim to human form by passing him in a gold cage through the fall of light from the Aurora Borealis, ""the gift of the winter Apollo"", within the shrine. However Zenobia vaporizes herself and possesses the body of a sabre-toothed tiger (smilodon), the guardian of the shrine, which mauls and kills the Troglodyte and Maroof before it is slain by Sinbad, firstly transfixing it with a gaff-spear originally used by the Minaton, and then using a scimitar for the coup de grace. The party escapes the collapsing shrine, which, with the whole of Hyperborea, now becomes covered in snow, and returns to Charak, where Kassim is duly installed as Caliph: he becomes enamoured of Dione, and gives his blessing to Sinbad and Princess Farah. The appearance of Zenobia's eyes at the end may mean all is not yet overNotes

Television host Jim Carr (Andrew Duncan) interviews Denis Lemieux (Yvon Barrette) on his show ""Sports Talk"" about the ""finer points of hockey."" English is the French Canadian player's second (and not best) language, but Denis gamely describes penalty moves like hooking and slashing, using his stick on Jim to demonstrate.Reggie ""Reg"" Dunlop (Paul Newman) is the team's aging player/coach, and the team is dead last in the second-rate Federal League. He meets opposing player Nick Brophy (Jon Gofton) at center ice to start the Hyannisport game, and Nick reveals he is drunk and resents that his coach put him in the game. In the broadcast booth, Chiefs player Dave Carlson (Jerry Houser), who supposedly was injured in a previous game, reveals that he isn't playing because he actually has a cold. The lone quality player for the Chiefs is Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean), who is not only the highest-scorer in the Federal League (he makes his record shot during the Hyannisport game), but he is also a Princeton grad who plays for the love of the game.Joe McGrath (Strother Martin), the team's manager, seems to be receiving encouragement by the mysterious team owner to come up with publicity stunts for the players. Some of the men are put into a fashion show, and Johnny Upton (Allan Nicholls) has had it: he warns McGrath that he plans to flash the audience so they won't have to do such degrading things again. Joe blows him off to make a phone call to locate Reg and Ned, who should be at the show as well, but has to stop the call short when cries of shock and disgust greet Johnny when he takes the runway.Ned and Reg pass the mill, which Ned tells him is going to close and lay off 10,000 workers. The Chiefs will have difficulty filling the stadiums with most of the town's residents suddenly out of work. Ned's wife Lily (Lindsay Crouse) drives them home from the local bar, uptight about being a hockey wife with a troubled marriage in a town she can't stand. Ned gives his attention to their St. Bernard dog Ruby and doesn't seem interested in his wife's attitude.Joe is training Reg for a future in an office job and tells him to pick up the three new players he obtained from the Iron League -- the Hanson Brothers (Jeff & Steve Carlson, David Hanson). He finds them at the bus station by the noise of one of the boys trying to force a lost quarter out of the vending machine by shaking it down. He takes them to their hotel where the team will pick up their expenses for a week and, as they go down the hall for sodas, he notices toy cars and tracks in their suitcase. Reg is less than impressed with the new acquisitions, and rails at Joe for picking up any discarded players he can find at rock bottom prices; his plan is to refuse to play them.At the bar Reg meets his (eventually) ex-wife Francine (Jennifer Warren), with whom he still has a good friendship. Before the bus leaves for an away game, Lily offers Ned a book with all the sex scenes highlighted, but he refuses to take it, though Reg is impressed. On the bus, Ned runs a betting pool and says that he will earn enough money to buy the team so he can run it his way. The team worries about a crazy player named Oggie Oglethorpe (Ned Dowd), but learn he was suspended and won't play. As Reg leaves the hotel for the game, he spots the Hansons playing with their racing cars. In the locker room, he sees them wrapping their knuckles with aluminum foil and tape prior to the game.Reg has a roll in the hay with Suzanne Hanrahan (Melinda Dillon), who reveals that she discovered she is a lesbian after a night of drinking and exploratory sex with another player's wife. On the ice, Reg decides to sneak a goal and approaches Tommy Hanrahan (Christopher Murney) in the goalie cage, skating by and egging him on about his wife being a dyke; Hanrahan chases Reg and leaves the cage open for a Chiefs goal. Ned is disgusted and calls the team's win ""garbage."" Reg, however, wants the team to be fired up and have hope for the future, so he works with reporter Dickie Dunn (M. Emmet Walsh) to suggest that a Florida retirement community may buy the team.The next day Reg sees Lily in the town square and talks with her; she is in a bad mood and even cusses over a statue of a dog in the square, supposedly a canine hero for saving the town during a 1938 flood.Reg tries to bolster the team's morale one player at a time, and talks with Dave Carlson about aging and suggests it may be time to quit hockey. Dave idolizes Reg, and when Barclay Donaldson (Ross Smith) from the Broom County team suggests that Reg shouldn't be in the league, Dave goes after him, and the fight puts him out of the game. Finally, desperate to win, Reg releases the Hansons on the rival team. The Hansons immediately assault and brutalize the opposition, much to the delight of Charlestown's working-class fans, who create a booster club and begin following the team on their own bus to attend away games.At a game against Peterboro, the teams begin fighting before the game begins and with no officials on the ice to stop the ruckus The boys are mutilated as they finally stand at attention for the National Anthem, but an official breaks ranks to yell at the Hansons. Then he realizes the song hasn't finished and cools off.By the time the team goes to an away game against Hyannisport they are winning, but their reputation has preceded them, and mobs of people boo them at their arrival. They stop jeering when the bus drives by with all the Chiefs and boosters mooning them out every bus window as they pass. The other Chiefs players soon take their cue from the popularity of the Hansons and become ""goons,"" fighting as much as (if not more than) actually playing hockey. At Peterboro a fan throws something and hits a Hanson in the face, and all three brothers take to the stands to find and pummel him. After the game the police arrest the Hansons. Peterboro still loses the game. When the bus arrives back in Charlestown and Ned is not on it for Lily to pick up (he gets off and walks the last few miles), Lily is upset and tears out of the lot in her van, but not before Reg climbs aboard and starts talking to her about getting her head straight. She drops him off at his place and drives off in tears. Francine tells Reg she has a job offering in Long Island and will be moving away.Reg goes on Jim Carr's radio show to announce that he wants to put a $100 bounty on the head of Syracuse player Tim McCracken (Paul D'Amato). Dave (who has taken the name ""Killer"") Carlson calls Reg, anxious to claim the money, which Reg says will have to be earned. Reg tries to get some sleep before the game, but Joe calls to read him off for putting a bounty on a player's head, and suddenly Lily has arrived with the dog and her belongings, anxious to straighten herself out. Reg passes out in the remaining bed space left by the St. Bernard. Before the game, Reg yells at the organist for playing ""Lady of Spain"" and rips up the sheet music. The game is going well, with plenty of beatings between goals, but Ned refuses to play dirty, so Reg benches him (first in his career) and Ned goes to the broadcast booth to gripe to Jim Carr, going into an uncharacteristic tirade and discovering that Jim wears a toupee (and announcing it on the air).Finally, Reg finds out that the team is owned by somebody named McCambridge, so he goes to the owner's home to talk with him. It turns out he is a she: widow Anita McCambridge (Kathryn Walker) tells Reg that she abhors violence and won't let her kids watch hockey. She plans to fold the team to take a tax write-off as her accountants have recommended. She realizes the Chiefs are sellable but chooses not to. Disgusted, Reg insults her and leaves, then drives to Ned's house to find he is out in the woods trying to avoid talking to him; he yells to Ned that he can play however he wants and, since the team is folding, he wants to go out in style.Reg takes Lily to Francine's beauty shop for a makeover at his expense. She says Lily is pretty and could look like Cher with the right hair and makeup.At the championship game, Reg tells the guys that he wants to play ""old time hockey"" and not be a goon for what might be his last game. The Hansons are all for it, so they take the ice and wait for the Syracuse team to come out, but the ice remains empty. Then the announcer receives the roster for the opposition: they have brought out the top goons to play against the Chiefs, including McCracken and the dreaded Oglethorpe. The moment the puck drops, the Syracuse men launch upon the Chiefs in a massive fight. Ned doesn't get involved, and Joe sits in amazement in the stands as his boys don't fight back. At the half-time break, Joe hollers at the mangled Chiefs that he has gathered every major NHL talent scout to the game to watch them and offer contracts.Back on the ice, ""old time hockey"" is gone, replaced by the Chiefs' old ways. While Ned sits on the bench, he suddenly spots Francine escorting the new, improved Lily to the stands; he is overcome with the sight of her, and suddenly he skates out to center ice and begins removing parts of his uniform. Jim Carr is stunned and disgusted, but the band launches into ""The Stripper"" as Ned continues his striptease and the other players slowly cease their fighting to watch. McCracken yells at an official to stop Ned, but he finds nothing wrong and won't interfere. McCracken then strikes the official, who declares the Syracuse team has forfeited the game and takes the winner's cup to Reg, who passes it to Ned as they skate off the ice (Ned stripped down to his skates and jockstrap) to thunderous applause. The Chiefs win the Federal League and receive a heroes' welcome back in CharlestownReg is pleased that the NHL's Minnesota Nighthawks want to hire him as their coach, and that several key Chief's players will be part of the bargain. Reg and Ned sit atop a convertible in the victory parade, and Lily is by Ned's side. Reg says farewell to Francine, who interrupts the victory parade in town as he lets her drive through with her things in a trailer, and he tells her to stay in touch through his new team."

He is approached by a shady father and son tycoon team (Big and Little Enos Burdett) who are planning a big party. Only problem is, in 1978 America, due to arcane liquor laws, it was illegal to ship Coors beer east of Texas...and the Burdetts wanted some for their Atlanta, Georgia shindig. 400 cases of it.The Burdetts offer The Bandit $80,000 dollars to get the brews in Texarkana, Texas and bring them back to Atlanta in 28 hours. Enter Cledus Snow, ""The Snowman."" Bandit convinces Cledus to drive the beer truck, while he will run blocker--distracting Smokey, just like in their heyday. With Cledus convinced, the decoy is revealed...a 1977 black Pontiac Trans Am with gold eagle paint scheme, one of the most iconic automotive symbols in American film history.Like the Battle of Troy is to Odysseus, securing of the brew is just the beginning. Now, they just gotta get it home. How hard could that be? They would have made it with hours to spare, save for their paths crossing with the disruption of the wedding of the soon to be blushing new couple, Deputy Buford T. and Mrs. Carrie Justice, Jr. Seems the almost-Mrs. Justice got second thoughts at the altar, and ""danced back up the aisle"", apologizing to Junior all the way. On her way out of the church, she flags down the first car to pass...Bandit Darville's Trans Am. She hops in, wedding dress and veil (for awhile at least), flapping in the T-tops. She introduces herself to The Bandit, who eventually names her Frog, as she's prone to hoppin'. Hey, you try getting out of a wedding train in a 70s American muscle car going 110 miles an hour.Back at the Justice wedding, the father of the groom is beside himself with rage. As he exits the church, Sherriff Buford T. Justice--OF TEXAS!!--is informed that the harlot who has embarassed him in front of his town sped away at harrowing speeds...in a black Trans Am. The pursuit is on!!Cledus is making good time in the beer truck, although an unscheduled swim with his co-pilot (Bassett Hound Fred) and a truck stop fight with a group of grizzled bikers lose him valuable minutes. Meanwhile, chemistry is sparking up ahead between Bandit and Frog. He even takes his hat off, which he only does for one thing...and one thing, only. As Texas turns to Arkansas, suddenly something becomes apparent...Sherriff Justice is still in pursuit, and he loses another marble with each new insult to his police vehicle.Many, many police cruisers are destroyed. An unfinished suspension bridge is jumped...and then, not. Diablo sandwiches. The rocking chair. Hot Pants. Finally, the entire Georgia State Police force, complete with helicopter, join the chase. In a stunning climax of events, the deadline is met...and the money is collected from Enos and enos. OK, not really. A double-or-nothing deal is struck for some Boston clam chowder (in 18 hours), and off run Bandit, Frog, and the Snowman in their new candy apple red Cadillac. Bandit, via the police band of his ever-present CB, finally presents himself to Buford...eventually. Tipping him off to their next destination, they speed away...heading north to New England. Sherriff Justice peels out of the parking lot, leaving Junior behind...obediently chasing Daddy. Who else, after all, is going to hold his hat?"
tt0076734,"['Drama', 'Romance', 'Thriller', 'War']","The film is about a group of students from Leiden, the Netherlands, amongst them Erik Lanshof (Rutger Hauer), Guus LeJeune (Jeroen Krabbé), Jan Weinberg (Huib Rooymans), and Alex (Derek de Lint). Robby Froost (Eddy Habbema) is a friend of Erik's, and Esther (Belinda Meuldijk) is Robby's girlfriend. Each of them happens to follow a different path and therefore has a different role in the Second World War, either as a collaborator or in the resistance. Part of the story is set in London, where Queen Wilhelmina (Andrea Domburg) has her residence. The students Erik and Guus fight alongside Colonel Rafelli (Edward Fox) and soldier Susan (Susan Penhaligon) of the allied forces in London.The film begins with a flashforward in the form of a newsreel with a voice-over. Queen Wilhelmina is accompanied by Erik arriving in the Netherlands from London shortly after the Second World War. After the newsreel the film starts in the late 1930s in Leiden, where freshmen undergo the humiliation of the initiation rites of their fraternity. Erik is picked out by Guus, the chair of the fraternity, who throws a bowl of soup over his head and injures him with the bowl. After this accident the two become close friends and Guus offers him a room in his private student apartment in the center of Leiden. In this house the students (Erik, Guus, Jan, and Alex) have a drink which confirms their new friendships.An English radio broadcasting interrupts the students in a tennis match and announces the declaration of war by the United Kingdom against Germany. In the beginning the students seem to take things lightly, the Netherlands will probably be neutral again, like in World War I. Jan and also Alex, who has a German mother, immediately join the Dutch army. Then German bombs start to fall, and Erik and Guus try to join the army but they are not accepted by a traumatized army officer. Shortly thereafter the Netherlands capitulates. Erik has an affair with Esther.Robby has a radio transmitter in his garden shed from where he contacts the Dutch resistance in London. He arranges for Erik to take a flight to London. The Jewish Jan, student boxing champ, gets into trouble by fighting with two anti-Semitic collaborators, who were bullying a Jewish salesman. Because of this Erik offers his place on the airplane to Jan, but during the pickup they get into a fight with Nazi soldiers, and Jan gets captured. Erik is able to escape.When Erik meets Alex during a military parade, he finds out he is now fighting on the German side for the SS. Later Erik is also captured. In prison he hears from Jan that ""Van der Zanden"" is the traitor in London. Jan is executed. Robby's radio installation is discovered and he is forced by the Gestapo to cooperate as a spy, because his fiancée Esther is Jewish.Erik and Guus try to flee to London again, this time on a Swiss boat and they get picked up by a Royal Navy ship. In London Erik meets Van der Zanden (modelled after general François van 't Sant) and tries to kill him, but he appears not to be a traitor but head of the Dutch Central Intelligence Service and a trustee of the Dutch Queen. Guus has an affair with the British soldier Susan. Erik and Guus agree with the Queen to pick up some resistance leaders who could play an important role in the Netherlands after the war. Guus is dropped on the beach and tricks himself into a party near the beach. Now Erik has an affair with Susan.Erik comes back to the Netherlands to pick up Guus and the resistance leaders. But Robby is with them on the beach and the Germans have followed the group who are about to escape by sea. Erik tried to warn them about Robby, but couldn't reach them. On his way to the beach Erik runs into Alex at a Nazi party close to the beach and dances ballroom tango with him in the middle of the party. Erik is able to flee from the party onto the beach and meets the others. When Robby sees that Erik knows about his collaboration, he flees. Then the group who tries to escape is under fire. The resistance leaders get killed, Guus escapes over land, and Erik is able to escape on the British ship and returns to London, and to Susan.When Guus meets Robby he shoots him in the middle of the street. Guus gets caught and is beheaded. Alex is fighting in Russia and gets killed by a hand grenade thrown by a boy he had insulted when he begged him for food. Erik becomes an RAF pilot and drops bombs over Germany.Later Erik is appointed as adjutant to the Dutch Queen, and accompanies her back to the Netherlands after the war is over, as shown in the newsreel in the beginning of the film. In the end Erik meets Esther again and finds that the Dutch have cut her hair short in anger at her and Robby's collaboration with the Nazis. She says she bears no grudge against anyone for this. Finally Erik celebrates the end of the war with one of his fellow students who also survived the war."
tt0076740,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","The film opens with a prologue that consists of four segments described by critics as ""vignettes"". They show the principal characters in different parts of the world and provide their backstories.Part I: PrologueVignette #1: Veracruz, MexicoNilo (Francisco Rabal), an elegantly dressed man, enters a flat in Veracruz. He immediately executes the unassuming tenant with a silenced pistol and proceeds to casually walk out onto the square.Vignette #2: Jerusalem, IsraelA group of Arab terrorists disguised as Jews causes an explosion in the city and flee to their hideout, where they equip weapons and plan their escape. After being surrounded by the military, they split up; two are killed and one apprehended. The only one who manages to escape is Kassem (Amidou). The segment ends as he helplessly stares at his captured companion.Vignette #3: Paris, FranceWhile discussing a book his wife is editing, Victor Manzon (Bruno Cremer) discovers an anniversary gift from her: a watch with a special dedication. After meeting with the president of the Paris Stock Exchange, where he is accused of fraud, Victor is given 24 hours to make amends. Victor meets his business partner, Pascal, and they quarrel; Victor insists that Pascal contact his father for assistance. Victor dines with his wife and her friend in a glamorous restaurant, and, he later receives a message from a butler that Pascal is waiting for him outside. When he learns that Pascal's father has refused to help, Victor is adamant that they try again. He walks his partner to a car, but Pascal shocks Victor by committing suicide. Faced with impending doom, Victor leaves both his country and wife.Vignette #4: Elizabeth, New Jersey, USAAn Irish gang robs a church with rival connections in Elizabeth that organizes bingo games, and they shoot one of the priests. Back in their car, the gang members have a violent argument that causes Jackie Scanlon (Roy Scheider), the driver, to lose concentration and collide with a truck. Everyone is killed but Scanlon, who is heavily wounded. The wounded priest turns out to be the brother of Carlo Ricci, a mafia leader who also controlled the flow of money in the church and now wants to kill Scanlon at all costs. Jackie meets with his friend Vinnie, who reveals his fate to him and finds him a suitable place to escape. Jackie has no choice but to agree.Part II: Life in PorvenirKassem, Victor and Jackie all assume fake identities and end up in Porvenir, a remote village in South America. Its conditions provide a stark contrast to their previous lives. The village economy is heavily reliant on an American oil company. Kassem befriends a man called 'Marquez', presumably a Nazi veteran. They all live in extreme poverty and earn meager salaries. All want out, but their savings are inadequate for emigration. After some time, Nilo arrives in the village, raising suspicions. In the meantime, an oil well over 200 miles away explodes, and the only way to extinguish the fire is to use nitroglycerin. Since the dynamite has been improperly stored in a local depot, the nitroglycerin contained inside has leeched into the bottom of the crates and is highly unstable -- the faintest vibration could cause an explosion. With all other means ruled out (including using an helicopter), the only way to transport it is to use trucks. The company seeks four drivers to man two such vehicles. Kassem, Victor, Jackie and 'Marquez' are offered the job, but they have to assemble the trucks using scrap parts. The nitro is packed into sand placed in the beds of the trucks to reduce shock. Shortly before their departure, Nilo kills and replaces 'Marquez', which angers Kassem.Part III: JourneyThe four drivers embark upon a perilous journey, facing many hazards and internal conflicts. Despite their differences, they are forced to co-operate. The road is quite uneven and blocked by overgrowth -- the bumps in the road threaten to detonate the nitro despite careful precautions. The two teams cross a highly dilapidated bridge which threatens to spill them into a raging river. Later they find that the road has been blocked by a huge fallen tree. Kassem rigs a crate of the nitro with a timed detonator and the tree is blown into splinters, allowing them to pass. As they continue, Kassem and Victor are killed when their truck hits a crumbling patch of the road and is spilled over the side. Jackie and Marquez encounter local rebel guerrillas who want to steal their truck. Marquez tries to kill them with his pistol and is shot. Jackie manages to kill the last guerilla & drives off with Marquez, who dies later of his wound. Jackie struggles to keep sane, overwhelmed by hallucinations and flashbacks. When his truck's engine dies just two miles short of the destination, he is forced to carry the nitroglycerin on foot. He faints when he sees the fire. EpilogueScanlon is offered legal citizenship and money, as well as another job, but he declines, opting instead for a dance with a barmaid. As he dances, Carlo Ricci's henchmen, along with his old friend Vinnie, emerge from a taxi and enter the bar. A gunshot can be heard."
tt0076752,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Thriller']","The pre-title teaser shows three different events: first, a British nuclear submarine experiences a serious disruption of power. The captain looks through the periscope and sees something foreboding, however we do not see what he does.In Moscow, Colonel Gogol hears from M that the British sub has disappeared. Gogol becomes concerned, especially since his own government has lost contact with one of its own nuclear subs a few days earlier. He promises the aid of his government and calls his best agent, ""XXX"" to investigate. In a bedroom, a man lying with his lover gets out of bed when a message comes through on a small communicator. The woman answers, revealing that she is XXX.In Austria, James Bond is enjoying a romantic encounter in a remote cabin in the Alps when he's called back to duty by M. He dons his ski gear and leaves, his lover says she needs him to which James replies, ""So does England!"" Moments after he leaves, his lover sends a message through a walkie-talkie telling her fellow agent ""He has just left."" As James skis away from the cabin, he's pursued by a group of four Russian agents. James is able to evade his attackers and, using a ski pole that doubles as a type of rocket gun, kills one of them, a man whom is the group leader (and who happens to be XXX's lover). Bond approaches a sheer cliff and skis over it, free falling several thousand feet until he opens a parachute decorated with the British Union Jack, escaping his attackers.Major Anya Amasova, aka, XXX, reports to Gogol in Moscow where she's given her new assignment - the search for the missing submarines. Gogol also informs her that her lover was killed in an operation in Austria. Amasova is visibly shaken but says she'll dedicate herself to the mission at hand.Meanwhile, Bond meets with M at a British naval yard where the mission path for the lost submarine is studied: Bond shows M, the Minister of Defense Sir Frederick Grey, and two Royal Navy commanders a transparency that matches the sub's route, proving it had somehow been compromised. M orders Bond to Cairo on his first lead.In the Mediterranean Sea, two scientists, Beckman and Marcowitz, who have developed a sophisticated submarine tracking device, meet with Carl Stromberg, a rich and powerful businessman who lives in a specially designed city, Atlantis, that can both float and submerge beneath the water's surface. He thanks the two scientists for their invention, but before he allows them to leave, he deals with his secretary, who has stolen information from him; she enters his elevator and Stromberg opens the window panel to reveal a large shark pool, then opens the elevator floor, dropping her into the large pool where a tiger shark eats her alive. As Beckman and Marcowitz leave by helicopter, Stromberg activates a bomb that destroys it and kills them, both tying up a loose end in his plan and to avoid having to pay them. Stromberg then meets with two hired assassins, the fat Hungarian agent Sandor and the seven-foot tall, silent Jaws, so named because he has steel teeth. Stromberg instructs them to go to Egypt and find the stolen submarine tracking system blueprints and to kill anyone who comes into contact with the plans.Bond arrives in Egypt, meeting with a old contact who tells him to find a man named Fekkesh, a local businessman whom is seeking to buy the submarine tracking system and who can point him toward another man, Max Kalba, who has the tracking system's microfilm. Bond goes to the man's house where a woman tells him Fekkesh isn't home and refuses to reveal his location. As Bond kisses her, Sandor tries to shoot him. Bond uses the woman as a shield and chases after Sandor, fighting with him and dangling him over the edge of the house's roof. He forces the assassin to reveal Fekkesh's location and then lets him fall off the building, killing him.Bond goes to Giza to meet Fekkesh at the pyramids where he sees XXX has already found the man. While the pyramid light show goes on, Fekkesh notices Jaws standing to the side. He quickly leaves to escape, Jaws in pursuit, Bond following closely. Jaws corners the man and kills him with a bite to his neck. Jaws also escapes from Bond.Continuing his investigation, Bond meets with Max Kalba at his nightclub in Cairo. Amasova also meets him there and the two speak with Kalba to obtain the microfilm. Kalba prepares to negotiate a price with the two government's agents when he's called away to the phone. Jaws (disguised as a maintenance man) kills him in the phone booth after obtaining the microfilm. Bond and Amasova stow away in Jaws' van and he drives out to a site of ruins in the desert... aware that they are in the back of his van.In the morning, the two agents stalk Jaws through a series of Egyptian ruins, finally cornering him and obtaining the microfilm. Bond and Amasova escape in Jaws' vehicle and make it to a boat on the Nile. Bond secretly examines the microfilm on board and the two settle down for the journey. Suddenly, Amasova renders Bond unconscious with a gas from a fake cigarette and takes the microfilm.Bond recovers the next morning and reports to another site of ruins where he finds Amasova, Gogol and M waiting. Though Amasova believes she'd outwitted Bond, he reveals that he'd already studied the film without her knowledge. With the assistance of Q, they examine the microfilm, which is worthless, a conclusion that Bond came to when examining it on the boat. However, they do find evidence of a symbol hidden in it that identifies Carl Stromberg. Their superiors order Bond and Amasova to investigate on the island of Sardinia, where Stromberg lives. The two travel there by train (in a scene that recalls the train ride in ""From Russia With Love""). They are attacked by Jaws, however, Bond is able to fight him off and expel him from the train. Jaws easily recovers from the fall, dusting himself off and looking mildly frustrated.Upon arriving in Sardinia, Bond and Anya meet Major Geoffrey ""Q"" Boothroyd, who has brought Bond's car, a Lotus Esprit, and as usual is irked at James' less than stellar record of returning Q's devices intact. The two meet with Stromberg's secretary and assistant, Naomi, who takes them out to Atlantis. Bond poses as a marine biologist and meets with Stromberg, who tells the undercover Bond of his love of the sea and how an underwater city (like the model he has in his private chamber) may be the only hope for the future of humanity. As they leave, Naomi is telling Anya about Stromberg's largest ship, a one-million ton supertanker named the Liparus. After seeing a small model of the tanker, Bond privately remarks that the design of her bow is unusual. After Bond and Anya leave Atlantis, Jaws comes out of a hidden room and confirms to Stromberg that Bond and Amasova are the spies that he encountered in Egypt. Stromberg instructs Jaws to wait until Bond and Amasova get ashore and to kill them both.As they speed away in Bond's Lotus, they are attacked by Stromberg's men, first by a motorbike assassin who attempts to destroy the car with a warhead disguised as a sidecar. When that plan fails and the cyclist is killed, Jaws and a carload of assassins attempt to shoot at Bond who is able to throw off their pursuit using the car's defenses. They are also attacked by Naomi in a helicopter, firing on them in a strafing run. As the chase continues, Bond drives off the end of a pier and converts his car to a small submarine. He uses a small missile to destroy Naomi's helicopter, killing her.In the submerged car/submarine, Bond and Amasova proceed to Atlantis, now submerged. Unable to find anything conclusive from outside, they prepare to leave and are attacked by several frogmen and mini-subs. Bond destroys them all with the Lotus' defenses, which Anya suddenly remembers, having stolen the plans for the car in another mission; however, they are forced to surface on a beach when the Lotus is damaged by an underwater mine and begins to leak.Back at their hotel, the two plan their next move. Bond sends a message to M in London, inquiring about the supertanker Liparus. A short while later, a telex reply comes back explaining that in the past nine months since the Liparus was launched, there is no record of the ship making port anywhere in the world. Bond and Anya suspect that something is up and decide to find the tanker to get a closer look at it. When Bond lights one of Anya's cigarettes, she notices that the lighter he uses is from the city near where her lover was killed. She confronts Bond on the issue, to which Bond replies that he'd acted in self-defense when he killed the man. Anya vows revenge as soon as their current mission is over, if they're still alive.The two spies next find themselves on an American submarine, the USS Wayne, monitoring the Liparus. While surveying it, the sub is rendered inoperable and is swallowed by the Liparus; the bow of the tanker opens, revealing a large submarine dock inside, containing the captured British and Russian subs. The crew are forced out of the sub and taken prisoner by the heavily armed crewmen. Bond and Anya are identified almost immediately and are also taken prisoner. On the bridge of the Liparus, Stromberg explains his plans to use the nuclear missiles aboard both the captured British and Russian subs to ignite a nuclear war between the superpowers. The resulting nuclear holocaust will destroy the surface world, leaving Stromberg the opportunity to rule an underwater kingdom.Stromberg departs for Atlantis with Anya as his personal captive, leaving his crew to begin the assault as crews board the British and Russian subs and depart to their launching stations in the Atlantic Ocean. Afterward, the Liparus' captain orders Bond to be put with the rest of the prisoners. Bond escapes before he can be imprisoned and frees the British, Russian and American sailors. The combined sub crews lead an all-out assault on the Liparus' crew, taking the dock areas and most of the ship despite taking heavy casualties, including the British sub captain. Unable to break into the heavily-fortified bridge control room, Bond uses a nuclear warhead detonator to blow a hole in the armored wall of the control room, and the crews kill the rest of the Liparus crew.With the two Stromberg-controlled submarines at their launch stations in the Atlantic, Bond has the American sub captain, Captain Carter (Shane Rimmer), use the tracking system computer on the Liparus to transfer the coordinates of each submarine missiles to the other as their targets. The ruse works, causing the two submarines to destroy each other with each other's missiles. On board the American sub, Captain Carter, now commanding a polyglot crew, orders torpedoes to be fired at the bow doors, allowing them to escape the Liparus. The large tanker explodes and sinks.They set course for Atlantis with orders to destroy it. Bond argues with Captain Carter that Anya is still on Atlantis and must be rescued first. He is given a wetbike (an early Jet-Ski) and arrives at Atlantis ahead of the sub. Bond takes the elevator to Stromberg's level, avoiding the trap door in the elevator floor. Bond finds Stromberg in his massive dining room. Stromberg attempts to kill Bond with a harpoon gun located under the dining table but misses. Bond returns fire, hitting the villain several times in the chest, killing him.Still searching for Anya, he encounters Jaws and outwits him, using an electromagnetic crane to seize his metal teeth and dropping him into the shark tank. The shark is no match for its namesake; Jaws quickly bites and kills it.Bond finds Anya tied up in a torture room, just as the American submarine begins its attack, torpedoing Atlantis. The city begins to sink into the ocean, slowly filling with water. Bond and Anya escape from Atlantis in a pod that surfaces. (Jaws himself is also seen escaping the stricken Atlantis and swims off to eventual rescue). In the pod, as Bond relaxes, Anya takes his gun, seemingly intent on killing him. But she changes her mind and shoots off a cork on a champagne bottle, having forgiven Bond in which she professes her love for him.A little later, the escape pod is found by a British vessel which captures it. M, Minister of Defense Gray and General Gogol find the two semi-nude agents in the midst of a romantic encounter inside."
tt0076759,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'SciFi']","Note: Italicized paragraphs describe scenes added for the film's 1997 special edition and updated for its DVD release.An opening title card reads:'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...'It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the DeathStar, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy.'Following the opening crawl, the frame moves down in the star field and we see a pitched battle between two starships in orbit around the desert planet of Tatooine. A small Rebel blockade runner, the Tantive IV, is being pursued by a mammoth Imperial star destroyer, the Devastator. Inside, protocol droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and utility droid R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) are tossed about as their ship endures a barrage of laser bolts, and ""3PO"" concludes that escaping capture will be impossible. The Rebel ship is so heavily damaged that its main power reactor must be shut down. It is caught in the Imperial destroyer's tractor beam, pulled into the hold of the larger ship, and boarded by stormtroopers from the Empire's 501st Legion.A huge firefight ensues in the corridors of the Rebel ship, with many Rebel soldiers being lost in the battle. When the smoke clears, Darth Vader (David Prowse; voice: James Earl Jones), a man dressed in a black cape, black armor, and a black helmet that obscures all his features, briefly surveys the damage before interrogating the ship's captain, Antillies, who claims that the ship is on a diplomatic mission to the planet Alderaan. Vader perceives that he is lying, noting that a consular ship would have an ambassador on board. (In actuality there is a diplomat aboard - Princess Leia Organa - but she is hiding from Vader, the second-ranking man in the Empire, which tends to support Vader's thesis that somebody on this ship is up to something.) Upon learning that ""the plans"" were not downloaded into the ship's computer, Vader strangles the captain. He then tells the troops to search the entire ship and to bring all the passengers to him - alive.C-3PO and R2-D2 manage to escape damage from the firefight. R2-D2 meets up with Princess Leia, who loads him with the stolen plans and records a holographic message for the small droid to take to the planet's surface. R2-D2 and C-3PO get away from the ship aboard an escape pod and go to the planet below; Imperial troops choose not to destroy the pod, as their scans detect no living organism on board, and presume it ejected due to a malfunction. Moments later the princess is stunned by Imperial troops and taken to Vader. He tells her that the Rebels have stolen some secret Imperial plans and transmitted them to her ship. She feigns ignorance and protests to Vader that she is a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to the planet Alderaan, but Vader doesn't believe her and orders her taken away. Vader's adjutant aide, Commander Jir (Al Lampert), insists that holding her captive is dangerous; news of her captivity would generate sympathy for the rebellion against the Empire. Vader instructs Jir to deceive the Senate and permanently erase any trace of Leia's whereabouts by faking her [accidental] death. Upon being notified by another officer that an empty escape pod was jettisoned during the firefight, he concludes that the Princess hid the stolen plans in the pod.C-3PO and R2-D2 land on the desert planet; R2-D2 mentions a mission to deliver some plans, but C-3PO is more concerned with staying in one piece long enough to find civilization. The two split up, and both are eventually captured by a group of diminutive scavengers called Jawas. The Jawas are junk traders, and R2-D2 and C-3PO are their newest assets. Meanwhile, a unit of Imperial Sandtroopers find the crashed pod and discover droid parts and tracks leading away from the crash site.The Jawas travel to the Great Chott Salt Flat settlement to sell droids and equipment to local homesteaders, eventually arriving at the homestead of Owen Lars (Phil Brown), a moisture farmer. The farmer purchases C-3PO for his translation skills, as he is fluent in six million forms of communication, but initially decides to buy a cheaper utility droid, R5-D4, which breaks down almost immediately after purchase. Eager to deflect accusations of selling shoddy merchandise, the Jawas offer R2 as a replacement. Owen accepts and tells his young 18-year-old nephew, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), to clean them up and put them to work. Luke had plans to meet some friends in the nearby town of Anchorhead, but his plans are put aside for work. During the cleanup, Luke stumbles across a short clip of the message stored in R2 by Princess Leia. The message is for someone named 'Obi-Wan Kenobi', and is a desperate plea for help. R2 insists that the message is simply a malfunction (""old data""), but Luke insists on hearing the complete message, intrigued by Leia's beauty. R2 then states that if Luke removes his restraining bolt, he might be able to play the rest of the message. Luke removes the bolt, but R2 doesn't play the message and claims not to know what Luke is talking about. Luke is called away for dinner (forgetting to replace the bolt, which will keep R2 within the boundaries of the moisture farm) and asks C-3PO to finish cleaning R2.During dinner, Luke tells his aunt and uncle that the droids may belong to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. This news greatly disturbs Uncle Owen, but he won't say why. Luke asks if Obi-Wan is possibly related to a hermit named Ben Kenobi who lives several miles away in the Dune Sea area, a vast terrain of sand and rocky canyons. Owen claims that Ben is ""just a crazy old man,"" and that Obi-Wan is dead; Owen makes a comment which seems to indicate that Obi-Wan Kenobi knew Luke's long-deceased father, Anakin, but when Luke presses Owen for details, his uncle quickly changes the subject and instructs Luke to erase the droids' memories the next morning. Luke - who hopes to leave home for training at a nearby Imperial Military Academy to become a space pilot - leaves the room angrily to return to cleaning the droids. Luke's Aunt Beru (Shelagh Fraser) tells Owen that Luke is too much like his father to remain with them, but Owen holds out hope that Luke's desire for adventure will subside - and expresses a fear that Luke is too much like his father... suggesting that Owen may know something of Anakin's terrible past.After dinner, Luke discovers that R2-D2 has escaped to find Obi-Wan Kenobi. Luke tells 3PO that it's too late to look for R2 because of the dangerous Sand People (also called Tusken Raiders) in the area, and that they will set out first thing in the morning to go look for him (hopefully before Owen discovers that due to Luke's negligence, his newest investment has disappeared).The following morning, Luke and 3PO set out in Luke's landspeeder to find R2. They locate him on the scanner and catch up with him. As soon as they find him, R2 informs them that his own scanner is picking up several creatures closing in on them. Luke fears the Sand People have found them, and confirms it using a set of minoculars. One ambushes them, hitting Luke over the head and knocking him unconscious. C-3PO goes tumbling down the side of a sand dune. R2 runs and hides.After stealing some parts off of Luke's speeder, the Sand People are frightened away by the sound of a vicious beast. The sound comes from a mysterious hooded figure. The figure checks on Luke and takes his hood off to reveal his features. He is an old, bearded man, who gently touches Luke's forehead. Luke quickly comes to and recognizes the man as Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness). Luke tells the man that his droid claims to belong to an Obi-Wan Kenobi. This knowledge startles the old man, who reveals (with a look of ancient mystery on his face) that he is Obi-Wan Kenobi but that he hasn't gone by that name in many years. After rescuing C-3PO, they go to Obi-Wan's home to discuss the matter.At Obi-Wan's home, Luke learns that Obi-Wan knew Anakin and that they were both Jedi Knights of the Old Republic and veterans of the talked about 'Clones Wars'. Luke had been told by his uncle that his father was a navigator on a spice freighter; Owen had been trying to protect Luke from the truth about his father, or perhaps simply trying to keep him safe. (Note: it's not clear that Owen knows the truth about Luke's father, other than that he was killed in a dangerous line of duty). Obi-Wan then produces Anakin's lightsaber, an energy sword which was the chosen weapon of the Jedi Knights; he seems to have kept it safe for some time. He gives the weapon to Luke, saying that Anakin wanted him to have it when he was old enough, but Owen would have none of it. Obi-Wan explains that a Jedi receives his power from the Force, an energy field that is created by all living beings that ""surrounds us, penetrates us, and binds the galaxy together."" But there is also a Dark Side to the Force, which draws power from negative emotions and baser impulses. A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was once a pupil of Obi-Wan, was seduced by this Dark Side. Vader betrayed and murdered Anakin, then became the Dark Lord of the Sith, the most feared enforcer of the Emperor. In this capacity, he proceeded to hunt down his former comrades, and the Jedi Order is now all but extinct.At this point Obi-Wan has R2 play Princess Leia's complete message. The princess reminds Obi-Wan of his past service to her father in the Clone Wars, and conveys his plea to assist in the Rebellion against the Empire. She senses that her mission to bring Obi-Wan to Alderaan has failed, and tells Obi-Wan that she has embedded information crucial to the rebellion in R2's memory banks. She asks Obi-Wan to deliver the droid to her father on Alderaan so that the information can be retrieved, and repeats her plea that he is now her ""only hope.""Obi-Wan cannot hope to undertake such a mission alone due to his advanced age, so he tells Luke that he should learn the ways of the Force and accompany him to Alderaan. Luke is adamant that he can't go, and that he must stay on Tatooine and help his uncle. Obi-Wan counters that the Rebellion needs Luke's help, and that the young woman in the message needs Luke's help (though she has not mentioned any personal request for help). They decide to go to the city of Anchorhead so that Obi-Wan can book a transport to Mos Eisely space port.Meanwhile, the Devastator has docked at the Death Star, a gargantuan space station resembling a small moon. Vader rendezvous with Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin (Peter Cushing), the high ranking governor of the Imperial Outland Regions, and they enter a conference room where they meet the station's Command Triumvirate leaders in a high level conference: Admiral Antonio Motti (Richard LeParmentier), High General Cassio Tagge (Don Henderson), and Chief Officer Mordramin Bast (Leslie Schofield) among other Imperial officers. As the Triumvirs argue about the best way to exploit their newest ""technological terror,"" Tarkin tells them that the Emperor has decided to dissolve the Imperial Senate; giving full control of the Galaxy's star systems to each of the regional governors under him and use the Death Star to intimidate all of the Empire's star systems into submission, suggesting that fear of force is preferable to its actual use. Admiral Motti is extremely confident in the new space station, calling it 'the ultimate power in the universe.' However, General Tagge is adamant that the Death Star is not invincible, and that the Rebels will figure this out if they have a chance to read its schematics. Vader tells them that the ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Motti callously mocks Vader's Jedi heritage, noting that the Force has not helped him recover the stolen schematics or pinpoint the Rebellion's headquarters. Angered, Vader uses the Force to strangle Motti, until Tarkin orders him to stand down. The commanders decide to focus on interrogating Leia until she gives up the location of the Rebel Headquarters. They will then use the Death Star to destroy it, killing two birds with one stone.As Luke and his companions travel to Anchorhead, they find the Jawa sandcrawler, completely destroyed with all the Jawas slaughtered; although they appear to be victims of the Sand People, Obi-Wan recognizes signs which indicate an attack by Imperial stormtroopers. Luke realizes that the only reason Imperial troops would kill Jawas is because they are looking for the droids which escaped the battle, and he races home, over Obi-Wan's objections that he is likely endangering his own life, hoping to warn Owen and Beru.However, Luke is too late. The Imperials have apparently come and gone, burned the homestead, and killed his aunt and uncle. Luke returns to Obi-Wan (who has used the opportunity afforded by Luke's trip to accord the massacred Jawas some measure of dignity), saying that with no reason to remain, he wants to go with him to Alderaan. More importantly, he declares his wish to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like his father once was.Luke, Obi-Wan and the two droids now travel to Mos Eisley, the spaceport and capital city of Tatooine. Before entering the city, Obi-Wan warns Luke and the droids that Mos Eisley is a hotbed of crime and near-lawlessness. Luke assures Obi-Wan that he knows how to handle himself in a fight. Upon entering the spaceport they are approached by Imperial troops at a roadblock asking questions about the two droids they have with them. Obi-Wan appears to induce a trance-like state in the lead guard, persuading him that these are not the droids they are looking for. When Luke is puzzled by the ease of their passage, Obi-Wan explains that the Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.At the Mos Eisley Cantina, Luke gets into a scuffle with two criminals, a deformed human named Dr. Evazan and his alien companion Ponda Baba, who threaten to kill him. When one of the creatures pulls a gun on Kenobi, the old Jedi Knight defends himself with his lightsaber - slashing off the creature's gun arm before it can shoot. Moments later they meet smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford), captain of the Millennium Falcon, and his first mate, Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), a 7-foot-tall, 200-year-old Wookiee. Upon learning that Obi-Wan and Luke are trying to avoid Imperial capture, Captain Solo gives his price as 10,000 credits for the trip. Luke balks at that price, stating that they could almost buy their own ship for that, but Han is dubious that they could fly it themselves. Obi-Wan tells Solo that they will pay him 2,000 credits now and 15,000 more once they reach Alderaan. Han agrees.After Luke and Obi-Wan leave, Han tells Chewbacca that 17,000 credits could really save his neck. As Chewbacca leaves to make pre-flight preparations, Han hangs back to take care of their bar tab, and is stopped by Greedo (Maria De Aragon and Paul Blake), a bounty hunter working for feared crimelord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, aka: Jabba the Hutt. Apparently some time earlier, Jabba had hired Han to transport a shipment of glitterstim spice (an illegal narcotic), but Han had to dump the shipment due to an unexpected Imperial boarding. As Greedo points a blaster pistol at Solo and forces him toward a secluded section of the bar, Han insists that he has the 8,000 credits he needs to cover the loss. Greedo suggests that Solo give it to him as a bribe not to turn him over to Jabba, forcing Han to admit that he doesn't actually have the money yet. Realizing that Greedo will either turn him over to Jabba or kill him for the bounty that Jabba has placed on him, Solo quietly removes his heavy pistol under the table, and when Greedo admits that he would just as soon see him dead as alive, Solo pre-emptively fires and kills him. On his way out, Han throws the bartender a few coins, apologizing for ""the mess"" he left.At the docking bay, Han is confronted by Jabba the Hutt and several other associates. Jabba expresses frustration over Greedo's death, and reminds Han of the nature of their business; he cannot ""make any exceptions"" of those who fail or cross him, lest he appear weak. Han insists that he will soon have enough money to pay off his debt, with interest, he just needs more time. Jabba reluctantly agrees, but warns Han that this is his last chance.Luke sells his landspeeder to raise money for their initial payment to Captain Solo. They head to the docking bay where the Millennium Falcon is being prepared for flight. Luke is somewhat perturbed to discover that the Falcon is a 60-year-old, run-down YT-1300 freighter, but Han assures him that he has made extensive modifications to ensure that she can run rings around any modern capital ship. Meanwhile, Imperial troops believe they are hot on the trail of the two droids when a local informant tells them the whereabouts of the fugitives after recognizing Luke and Obi-Wan.No sooner do Luke, Obi-Wan and the droids board the Millennium Falcon than the Imperial troops come running into the docking bay, hoping to arrest Luke and Obi-Wan and capture the droids. The troops fire at Solo and the Falcon, but the ship manages to escape. Once they clear the planet, they are immediately pursued by two huge Imperial star destroyers. Solo remarks that his passengers must be of particular interest to the Empire. They jump to light speed, escaping the Imperial ships.Princess Leia has been tortured by the Imperials and undergone a mind probe in an effort to extract the location of the Rebels' home base. They have found nothing. Tarkin, Vader, and Motti shift tactics, threatening to destroy the Princess's home planet of Alderaan if she won't reveal the Rebels' location. She reluctantly tells them that the Rebel base is on the planet Dantooine. Tarkin then orders his officers to proceed with Alderaan's destruction, noting that Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration of the Death Star's power. Alderaan is destroyed by a single blast from the Death Star's enormously powerful laser blaster while Leia is forced to watch.On board the Millennium Falcon, Obi-Wan is training Luke in the ways of the Force when he is greatly disturbed by a tremor in the Force. He feels that millions of people have died in an instant amidst great suffering, though he doesn't know how. He decides to meditate on this further as Luke continues an exercise in allowing the Force to guide his reflexes. Han is not impressed, and explains that he does not believe in the Force. Luke, however, manages to use his lightsaber to deflect four laser bolts in a row from a remote droid - all while wearing a helmet which covers his eyes.Back on the Death Star, Tarkin and Vader receive a report that there once was indeed a Rebel base on Dantooine but it has long since been abandoned. Outraged at Leia's successful trickery, Tarkin orders her scheduled for execution.Luke realizes that he is learning how to sense the Force. One of the Falcon's signals informs them that they are approaching Alderaan, but upon exiting light speed, they find the Millennium Falcon is in an asteroid field instead of Alderaan's orbit. Han confirms that they are in the right location but that the planet is missing; Obi-Wan quietly states that the planet has been destroyed by the Empire, but Solo laughingly insists that all the Empire's ships combined wouldn't have enough firepower to destroy a planet. Moments later they are overflown by an Imperial Twin Ion Engine (TIE) snubfighter. Obi-Wan concludes it is too small for long range flight, so there must be an Imperial base or ship nearby. As they chase after the fighter to keep it from notifying the Empire of their location, they see the fighter heading toward a small moon - the Death Star. They are caught in the Death Star's tractor beam and, helpless to resist, are pulled aboard the station into a docking bay. Obi-Wan tells them that neither fighting or surrender are viable choices, but a third option is available to them.Imperial troops board the Falcon, but its crew are hiding in smuggling compartments below the floor. Vader orders scanning equipment to be brought aboard to look for life signs. While standing near the Falcon, he senses a presence he has not felt for some time. Vader leaves the hangar, pursued by the frustrating sense he is overlooking something of great importance.When a scanning teams boards the Falcon to set up their equipment, Luke and Solo manages to overpower them and lures the two guarding stormtroopers just outside on board as well to kill them both and steal their armor uniforms. The helmets conceal their identity and allow them to infiltrate a troop command center outside the docking port. Inside the command center, R2 plugs into the station computer system and discovers the location of the tractor beam generator. Obi-Wan sets out to shut down the generator so that the ship can leave. Luke wants to accompany him, but Obi-Wan orders Luke to stay, noting that Luke's destiny now splits paths from his own. Perhaps sensing that this is the last time he will see Luke in this reality, he tells Luke, ""The Force will be with you... always.""After Obi-Wan leaves, R2 discovers that the princess is being held prisoner on board the station. Luke suddenly takes the initiative, sparing no effort to convince Solo and Chewbacca to assist him in what is surely going to be a very risky rescue. Han, initially scared for his own neck, eventually agrees, but only after Luke suggests that a great monetary reward would surely follow her rescue. Luke and Han take Chewbacca ""captive"" and assume their trooper identities in order to infiltrate the prison block. In the prison block, the officer in command becomes suspicious of their arrival since he was not notified about any prisoner transfer. As a result, Luke and Han's escorted ""prisoner"" escapes and a firefight erupts between the Imperials and Luke, Han, and Chewbacca. They manage to take out all the Imperials, but set off an alarm in the process. A squad of troops are sent to investigate. Han and Luke know they have only moments to find the princess's cell and escape.They find the princess, but the arriving troops cut off the only escape route. Leia shoots a hole in a garbage chute and tells everyone to dive in. They escape the Imperials, only to find themselves trapped in a large garbage compactor. To make matters worse, the compactor also houses a large, serpent-like creature - the dianoga - which yanks Luke under the murky, stagnant water in the compactor, almost drowning him. The creature inexplicably lets Luke go, but just as they catch their breath, the compactor activates and the walls begin to move in, threatening to crush Han, Luke, Leia, and Chewbacca. Luke calls 3PO on the communicator and orders him to have R2 shut down all garbage compactors in the detention level. R2 complies just in time to save them and then open their compactor's door to let them out.Meanwhile, Vader informs Tarkin that he senses through the Force that Kenobi is aboard the station. Tarkin is doubtful, but the discussion is soon interrupted by an emergency report: Princess Leia has escaped! Vader tells a shocked and bewildered Tarkin the true explanation for Leia's impossible escape - ""Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him."" Sensing that Obi-Wan wishes a final showdown, Vader sets off to find him. Unbeknownst to anyone, Kenobi has deactivated the tractor beam generator.After their escape from the compactor, Luke and Han dispose of their stormtrooper armor, but keep the troopers' utility belts and weapons. On their way back to the ship they're cut off by more troops. They are split up, with Han and Chewbacca fighting together and Luke and Leia running on their own.After being cornered between a great air shaft and a group of troopers, Luke shoots a blast door's controls with his blaster, locking the troops on the other side of the door. Unfortunately, the blast also destroys the controls that extend the bridge across the air shaft. After a gunfight with stormtroopers on the other side of the shaft, Luke uses a cable and grappling hook from his freshly confiscated Imperial utility belt to swing himself and Leia safely across the gorge.Obi-Wan, on his way back to the Falcon, encounters Vader. They exchange barbed comments. Vader boasts to his former master that he is so much more experienced and powerful than he was the last time they met that the tables have now turned, with Vader the more powerful of the two. Obi-Wan replies that Vader's turn to evil has made him oblivious to the Force's true power. A ferocious lightsaber duel ensues.Luke, Leia, Han and Chewbacca meet at the entrance to the docking bay. The lightsaber duel on the other side of the bay distracts the troops guarding the ship, allowing the four of them, along with R2 and 3PO, to sneak across to board the Falcon. As Kenobi and Vader continue to fight, Kenobi informs Vader that if Vader strikes him down, he shall become even more powerful, beyond what Vader could possibly imagine. Kenobi, seeing that the four heroes and two droids are safely boarding the Falcon, takes one last look from his comrade's son to the man who betrayed him, and smilingly withdraws his saber, allowing Vader to slice through him. His body instantly disappears. Vader is stunned and confused by this, as he determines that no one is in Kenobi's now-empty cloak on the floor.Luke, appalled by the sight of his mentor being struck down by Vader, lets out a shout of horror, alerting all of the troops to their presence. Another firefight immediately erupts, and they barely make it aboard the ship with their lives. Luke stays behind, attempting to shoot every Imperial soldier in the hangar, despite his friends urging him to join them on the ship so they can escape. Finally, he relents, hearing Obi-Wan's voice telling him to run, as Vader catches a glimpse of him through a rapidly closing set of blast doors. When the Falcon flies out of the docking bay, the Imperials are unable to activate the tractor beam, thanks to Kenobi.Having blasted their way out of the station's defense range, they are confronted by four Imperial TIE fighters. Luke and Han man two large gun turrets on the top and bottom of the Falcon and manage to destroy all four ships. Han starts to boast to Leia about his amazing abilities during her rescue. She insists that the Empire let them escape in order to track them to the Rebel base. Han is doubtful of that as she explains to Han that R2 is carrying the technical readouts to the Death Star. She has high hopes that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found in the station.Back aboard the station, Leia's fears are confirmed as Vader and Tarkin discuss their plan to track the Falcon to the hidden Rebel base. The Falcon makes it to the base, located on the fourth moon of the gas giant Yavin Prime. After R2's data is analyzed, it is determined that the Death Star does indeed have a weakness that can be exploited; a small (two meters) exhaust port not protected by any shielding, through which a well-placed proton torpedo could reach the main reactor and destroy the station. The port is situated in a narrow trench protected by General ARea Defense Integration Anti-spacecraft Network (GARDIAN) turbo-lasers. The Rebel commander, General Dodonna (Alex McCrindle), theorizes that since the GARDIAN array is designed to repel large scale assaults from capital ships, it could easily be outmaneuvered by smaller and faster snubfighters. A plan is devised in which a squadron of Y-Wing assault bombers (Gold Squadron, led by Captain Jon ""Dutch"" Vander (Angus MacInnes)), will skim the trench. A second squadron (Red Squadron, commanded by Captain Garven Dreis (Drewe Henley)), comprised of the faster, more maneuverable X-Wing snubfighters, will attempt to draw enemy fire away from the bombers. Luke will be flying one of the X-Wings, under the call sign Red Five. Fellow pilot Wedge Antilles (Denis Lawson) is skeptical about succeeding, but Luke is confident that the task can be accomplished, noting that he used to shoot at animal targets on Tatooine which were not much bigger than two meters.The Rebels set out to attack the Death Star just as the station enters the Yavin system. The Death Star will have to orbit to Yavin's far side in order to have a shot at the moon on which the base is located. The approximately 30 Rebel fighters have less than 30 minutes to fly to the station and destroy it.As Luke heads to the hanger, he is reunited with Biggs Darklighter (Garrick Hagon), who used to fly with Luke on Tatooine. Biggs congratulates Luke on finally making it off Tatooine and tells him that the coming battle will be just like old times.Having apparently collected the balance of his 17,000 credits payment for delivering the plans to the Rebellion (plus some unspecified reward for helping Leia escape from the Death Star), Han refuses to join the fight, stating that his reward will be useless if he is killed, and that he would rather take his money and go pay off his debts. Luke is disappointed, but boards his fighter and takes off, right after R2 is loaded into the rear of the fighter to provide technical assistance. Upon departure, he hears what sounds like Obi-Wan's voice speaking to him, saying ""The Force will be with you."" He quickly dismisses it.Both squadrons approach the Death Star and Wedge Antilles briefly marvels at its size before Captain Dreis cuts off the idle chatter and orders the squadrons to attack speed. Red Squadron initiates a strafing run on the station's surface to divert attention from the bombers, and Luke makes a run that detonates a mammoth fire within part of the Death Star - a fire so large his own ship suffers minor burns. When Vader is informed that the GARDIAN turbo-lasers are having trouble targeting the small rebel ships, he orders fighters led by Black Squadron, his personal elite TIE fighter squadron, to engage the X-Wings individually. In short order, six TIE fighters join the battle, soon followed by others, and Red Squadron scrambles to keep them away from the trenches. Dreis warns a wingman of an attacking TIE fighter but the X-Wing is immediately shot down before Biggs himself comes under attack; Luke swings behind the attacker and shoots him down.Vader notices Dutch and his Y-Wing group breaking away from the primary attack. He assigns two Black Squadron pilots, Mauler and Backstabber, to escort him as he boards a TIE Advanced x1 fighter to engage the bombers himself. Before this command group launches, the sky battle rages on and Luke himself comes under attack; Wedge rescues him by shooting into the belligerent TIE fighter literally nose to nose, just as Dutch and Gold Squadron commence the attack into the trenches.Vader and his two wingmen easily outmaneuver the Y-Wings, methodically dispatching them one by one; first pilot Tyree is killed, as Dutch begins to panic despite angry urging by his surviving wingman. Dutch is then killed and the surviving Gold Squadron ship aborts his run before he himself is destroyed.With Gold Squadron effectively wiped out, Dreis orders the surviving X-Wing pilots to start a second attack run down the trench. As they approach the exhaust port, Dreis turns on his targeting computer as two other ships cover his tail from enemy fire. The escorting ships are destroyed, but they buy enough time for Dreis to take a shot at the exhaust port. His shot misses and merely impacts on the surface. Moments later he loses an engine to Vader's gunnery and his fighter spirals into the surface of the station.Now nominally in charge of Red Squadron, Luke decides that it is his responsibility to try to destroy the port. R2 is preoccupied trying to keep the ship running, despite all of the damage they are sustaining. With Biggs and Wedge flying his wing, they start down the trench. Moments later, they are pursued by Vader and his wingmen, who partially disable Wedge's ship. Luke tells Wedge to disengage, seeing that he can't be of any help in a crippled ship. Vader allows Wedge to withdraw, ordering his men to continue to pursue the two ships in the trench. Vader fires again, hitting Biggs' ship and destroying it. Luke is grieved by the loss of his friend, but presses on.As Luke gets closer to his target, he hears the voice of Obi-Wan, telling him to ""use the Force"" and rely on his instincts more than the technology in his ship. Heeding that advice, Luke switches off his targeting computer and continues flying down the trench. When asked by Mission Control why he switched off the computer, Luke responds that nothing is wrong.Meanwhile, the Death Star has completed its run around Yavin and is cleared to fire on the Rebel moon. The countdown for the firing sequence begins. Bast tells Tarkin that he has analyzed the attack and concludes there is a real threat to the station. Tarkin scoffs at evacuation and insists the Empire will prevail. He remains on the station while some of the Imperial officers and troops evacuate as a precaution.As Luke draws on the power of the Force to help him hit his target, Vader senses the strength of the Force in his prey. He takes a shot, which misses the ship but hits R2-D2. Just as he locks on to Luke's ship to finish him off, Backstabber's ship explodes unexpectedly. Out of nowhere appears the Millennium Falcon, which has just destroyed the Imperial fighter - diving vertically towards Vader and the remaining wingman. This sudden turn of events distracts Mauler; he loses control of his ship and crashes into Vader's. Mauler's ship ricochets into the trench wall, destroying it, and sends Vader's ship spinning out of control, up and away from the Death Star.Han informs Luke that he is all clear to fire. Luke, having drawn upon the power of the Force, releases his proton torpedoes, which enter the exhaust port perfectly on target. Luke, the Falcon and a few other fighters race away from the Death Star just as the Death Star prepares to fire on the moon. Only seconds before the station fires, it explodes into a huge fireball, sending millions of fragments into space. Tarkin, Motti, Tagge, and most of the senior Imperial staff are killed. With that triumph, Kenobi reminds Luke that the Force will be with him, always.Vader, having been thrown into space during his collision with the wingman, is now apparently the only one to have escaped the station's destruction. He eventually manages to regain control of his wildly gyrating fighter, and when he finally stabilizes, he flies off to meet the Imperial Fleet as the Rebels head home to their base. When they reach the base, Luke is clearly delighted that Han returned to help him. Leia is thrilled to see both of her friends alive. And everyone is ecstatic that the Death Star has been destroyed. Their celebration is briefly interrupted as R2 is pulled from Luke's ship. He is heavily damaged from Vader's gunfire and does not respond to C-3PO. The golden robot is terribly concerned, but Luke and two mechanics assure him that R2 is repairable and will be fine.Later, an awards ceremony is held in a huge hall. Hundreds of Rebel soldiers, officers, and pilots are present. A door at the rear of the hall opens to reveal Luke, Han, and Chewbacca. They walk down the aisle to where Leia awaits, along with several Rebel leaders and dignitaries.Also present are a freshly polished C-3PO and a freshly overhauled and looking better-than-new R2-D2. Upon reaching the front of the great hall, Luke and Han are awarded medals for bravery by a smiling Princess Leia. The hall erupts into thunderous applause."
tt0076786,"['Horror', 'contentRating', 'R']","A young American ballet student, Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper), flies to Germany to attend a prestigious dance academy. On the night of her arrival there is a torrential downpour. She arrives at the school by taxi, and before she can enter, she witnesses a young blonde girl (Eva Axén) fleeing the building in a panic. Suzy hears the girl shouting to someone just inside the door of the school, but the intense thunder obscures most of her words. When the other girl is gone, Suzy talks to an unidentified person on the school's intercom, but they refuse to let her inside. Unable to gain access to the school, Suzy gets back into her cab and has the driver take her away. As the cab drives through a nearby forest, Suzy sees Pat running alone through the trees that separate the school from town.The frightened girl is Pat Hingle, and she flees to a friend's apartment in the nearby town. While alone in the bathroom, she becomes transfixed by a pair of shining eyes outside the window, and a decidedly inhuman arm smashes through the glass, grabbing her. She is pulled out of the window onto the roof, stabbed numerous times, and then hanged by a cord when she falls through the sky light. The huge pieces of glass and metal that break out of the skylight fall on Pat's friend, killing her by impaling her body and her head in numerous places.Suzy goes to the school the next day and is greeted by Ms. Tanner (Alida Valli), an instructor, and Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett), the vice directress. Madame Blanc is very friendly to Suzy, especially when she realizes she knows Suzy's aunt Carol. Detectives are there investigating Pat's murder, and although Ms. Tanner tries to hurry Suzy away, Suzy volunteers a few bits of information. It seems as if there is something that she cannot remember, some realization that she can't put her finger on. Suzy meets a few other odd characters, including a strange looking handyman named Pavlo (Giuseppe Transocchi) and a blind pianist named Daniel (Flavio Bucci).In the changing room, Suzy meets two other students, Olga (Barbara Magnolfi) and Sara (Stefania Casini). Sara and Olga are not friends, and Olga taunts Sara a little. Although Suzy has requested to board at the school, the rooms are all full and it's been arranged for Suzy to live with Olga in her off-campus apartment. Although Olga initially seems very bitchy, she and Suzy get along well and have a conversation about Pat. Olga tells Suzy that Pat was a ""busybody"", and that she was always trying to find out things about other people. Suzy thinks back to seeing Pat the night before, and she suddenly remembers Pat shouting the words ""secret"" and ""iris"".The next day, Suzy sees Madame Blanc before classes, and she tells Suzy that her dorm room is now free. Suzy, however, tells Madame Blanc that she'd rather live with Olga. Madame Blanc seems offended by this and walks away in a huff. Ms. Tanner sarcastically tells Suzy that she is happy she's so ""strong willed"". On her way to class immediately afterwards, Suzy passes by the cook, who is sitting in the hallway with Madame Blanc's small nephew Albert (Jacopo Mariani). The cook is polishing some silver, and she reflects a beam of sunlight at Suzy, who immediately begins to feel ill. In class, Ms. Tanner keeps pushing Suzy to dance, and Suzy passes out, bleeding from her nose and mouth.The school doctor (Renato Scarpa) puts Suzy on a restricted diet that includes cheese, fruit, and a glass of red wine. Suzy also finds that she's been moved into the dorms without her consent. Her dorm room is next to Sara's, and the two of them become friends. As the girls dress for dinner, hundreds of maggots start to fall from the ceiling. Ms. Tanner investigates the upper floor and finds that crates of spoiled food have caused the maggot infestation. Madame Blanc apologizes to the girls, and arranges for all of them to sleep in the practice hall. A wall of sheets separates the girls from the teachers, who are staying with the girls for the night. Suzy asks Sara if the teachers live in the school, but Sara tells her that they leave at 9:30 every night. When the girls sleep, a shadowy figure lays down on the other side of the sheet behind Suzy and Sara. The person has a very distinct, raspy, whistling snore and it frightens Sara, who wakes Suzy up. Sara tells her about a time last year when she had to sleep in a guest bedroom: late that night, she had heard the same snoring in the next room. Madame Blanc later told Sara that the school's directress stayed in that room, so the weird snoring means the directress is now here. This seems suspicious to Suzy and Sara, since all the girls have been told that the directress would not return to the school for weeks.The next morning, Sara asks Ms. Tanner if the directress showed up last night, but Ms. Tanner denies it. As classes start, Madame Blanc's young nephew, Albert, is attacked by Daniel's guide dog. Enraged, Ms. Tanner interrupts class and tells Daniel never to bring the dog back or she'll have it put to sleep. Daniel yells at her and insists his dog would never harm anyone. Ms. Tanner throws Daniel's cane to the floor and tells him to get out, humiliating him as he fumbles around trying to find it. Daniel is enraged, and makes a veiled threat to Ms. Tanner: he is blind, but not deaf. Ms. Tanner is furious.That night, after Suzy eats her meal Sara comes into her room and they listen while the teachers supposedly leave. However, Suzy notices that the footsteps are going away from the front door; therefore the teachers are not really leaving the school at all, but going someplace inside. Sara begins to wonder where they go, but Suzy becomes extremely drowsy and can hardly stay awake. Sara takes out a notebook and writes down the number of footsteps as the instructors walk by.Daniel, who has been out at a bar, leaves with his dog. While in the middle of an empty piazza, his dog begins to bark at something. Daniel tries to calm down the dog, but he just gets more restless as they walk. Daniel begins to become frightened and stops, hearing strange sounds that indicate to him someone else is there. We can also see shadowy figures moving in the distance. As Daniel waits silently in the piazza, his dog suddenly attacks and kills him, tearing out his throat.Suzy is troubled by the sudden number of deaths and approaches Madame Blanc. She tells Blanc that she heard Pat say something the night she died. Although Pat had said more, Suzy only heard ""secret"" and ""irises"". Madame Blanc says she will inform the police about Suzy's information, but Sara later gets angry that Suzy told this to Madame Blanc. Sara worries that Suzy's revelation has put the teachers on a hunt for whoever Pat was talking to that night, and that the teacher will obviously identify that person as herself. As the two go for a swim in the pool, Sara tells Suzy all about her friendship with Pat, and how Pat had been taking notes for months about strange occurrences at the school. However, when Sara is going to show them to Suzy that night, the notes are gone; now she knows that the evil forces in the school are onto her and her time is short. The only thing she has left is the list of footsteps she made. Sara tries to get Suzy to help her, but once again Suzy cannot stay awake. Sara begins to hear footsteps and flees Suzy's room just before an unseen person enters. Sara escapes to the attic, where she is attacked but hides in a room and latches the door shut. Her stalker tries to use a strait razor to unlatch the door. With nowhere else to go, Sara cowers away from the door when she notices a small window near the ceiling. Stacking several boxes on top of each other, she leaps through the window and into the next room; unfortunately, the small room is filled to the brim with large, unruly bushels of razor wire. She tries to escape to an open door a few feet away but keeps getting tangled and cut. Just as she is near the door, the killer slices her throat.The next morning, Suzy finds Sara's room empty. Ms. Tanner tells Suzy that Sara left early that morning without telling anyone. Suzy meets with a friend of Sara's, who turns out to be Sara's psychologist. He tells Suzy that Sara became troubled when a friend put the notion of witches in her head. Sara also found out that the school was founded by Helena Markos, a Greek émigré, who people thought was a witch. Markos was persecuted wherever she went, and she founded the school for the study of occult sciences and arts. However, Markos died in a fire, and the school was passed down to her favorite pupil who turned it from a school for the occult to a dance academy. Suzy talks to a colleague of Dr. Mandel who specializes in witches, Professor Milius. Milius explains to Suzy that witches are negative forces that change events only to do harm, and their goal is to gain personal wealth that can only be achieved by injury to others. He also tells her that a coven of witches can only do magic with the power of their queen. Otherwise, they are harmless.Back at school, Suzy finds out that all the students are gone. She asks a servant, who tells her that all the students went to the theater, and that Ms. Tanner got the tickets. Suzy tries to call Frank Mandel, but a storm knocks out the phones. In her room, Suzy dumps her food out, and throws the wine down the sink, which looks suspiciously like blood. Afterwards, she is attacked by a vicious bat that flies in the bathroom window. She begins to hear the teachers footsteps, and remembers counting them with Sara. Following the count, Suzy traces their path and ends up in Madame Blanc's empty office, where the footsteps stopped. With only one door, she knows the teachers exited somehow. Glancing into a mirror, she notices irises painted on the wall in the elaborate grotto illustration that adorns Madame Blanc's office. Suddenly Suzy remembers what she had forgotten. When exiting the school, Pat said ""The secret! I saw behind the door! Three irises! Turn the blue one!""Suzy turns the blue iris and a hidden door pops open. She sneaks down a hallway and, hiding behind a curtain, she sees the entire coven meeting with Madame Blanc, who is sitting on a throne. She and the others discuss how they will kill Suzy. Conducting a black mass ritual, Madame Blanc partakes of some kind of communion wafer and says ""Queen Helena, give me power!"" Afraid they might find her, Suzy backs away and stumbles upon Sara's corpse. She flees into a connecting room, which turns out to be a bedroom. Asleep in the bed, obscured by sheer white curtains, is a shadowy figure, snoring loudly--the same weird snoring of the directress, whom Suzy now realizes is Helena Markos. Frightened, Suzy knocks over an ornamental statue which wakes up Helena Markos. In a horrible, raspy voice, Helena speaks to Suzy: ""The American girl! I knew you'd come. You want to kill me!"" Suzy picks up one of the sharp glass feathers from the statue and pulls back the curtain of the bed only to find it empty. Confused, Suzy looks around while Markos taunts her. A door slowly opens, and Sara's corpse, back to life and wielding a knife, approaches Suzy. As lightning strikes, Suzy notices a slight outline of Markos still sitting there on the bed; she is simply invisible. Suzy stabs her through the neck. Sara disappears, and the burnt features of Markos become visible as she dies; the weapon has penetrated through her entire neck, and she chokes to death. Things in the bedroom begin to explode, and Suzy rushes out. As she passes by their meeting room, she sees Madame Blanc, Miss Tanner, and the others, all collapsed and bleeding due to the death of Markos. Suzy runs away, and everywhere she goes, power exudes from her, destroying all in her path. Doors explode outwards before she can touch them, and walls crack and break as she passes. Finally she reaches the exit and walks out into the rain as the house burns behind her. Suzy smiles cryptically as she walks away from the school. Perhaps she is simply happy to have escaped, or perhaps it is as the legend goes, that whoever kills a witch inherits her power."

Based on historical events in 1701 -- 1702, the movie tells the tale of the Asano clan's downfall and the revenge of its former samurai on the perpetrator of the catastrophe. Lord Asano was goaded, or tricked, into drawing his sword inside the Shogun's palace -- a crime which carried the death penalty. The newly installed Shogun was furious at Asano and ordered all his clan's assets seized, meaning some 20,000 samurai and commoners were unemployed and landless at a stroke. Forty-seven of these ronin (masterless samurai) banded together to take revenge on Lord Kira, who had goaded Asano into drawing his sword. They bide their time for a year and a half. Disguising their intentions, they lead public lives of drunken dissipation, while planning in secret. They finally succeed in exacting their revenge against powerful odds, and then commit ritual suicide to atone for breaking the law. They are buried at the temple of Sengaku-ji in Tokyo. Their graves are still in existence and are considered a national shrine. An annual festival is held there to celebrate these events. (Goof: The movie subtitles state the events began in 1702, in fact they began April, 1701 and the revenge took place December 14, 1702.)"

As Alan continues to broadcast rock 'n' roll music, his show is enjoyed throughout the city.Sometime later, station manager Peter ""Pete"" Overmyer (Stephen Pearlman) storms into Alan's booth, furious that the disc jockey has ignored his ""don't play"" list. Overmyer explains that the New York City police department and the Board of Health, among other local establishments, have issued complaints about the station broadcasting rock 'n' roll music; Overmyer begs Alan to play popular singers such as Patti Page or Pat Boone. Alan's colleagues Sid (Will Thornbury) and Gordie (Pat McNamara) chuckles in the booth as Alan ignores Overmyer's threats. When Overmyer storms away, Sid asks Alan about the upcoming rock 'n' roll concert Alan is organizing and questions why the music sparks such controversy, but Alan is unable to explain.As Alan continues his radio show, an African-American group called The Chesterfields comes to the station wanting to sing for Alan. Meanwhile, Alan's secretary, Sheryl (Fran Dresher), and his driver, Mike, bicker in the reception area as music industry men arrive at the station, eager for Alan's attention. At the end of the night, a young hopeful named Teenage Louise (Laraine Newman) corners Alan in the elevator and pitches one of her original songs, but Alan is unimpressed. Louise follows Alan outside, where he is serenaded by The Chesterfields. When Alan expresses interest in the group and invites them to come back, Louise strikes up a conversation with the musicians and The Chesterfields agree to perform one of her original songs.Elsewhere in New York City, district attorney Coleman (John Lehne) and his associates listen to a recording of Alan's show and Coleman explains that Alan has a strong influence on the public. Referring to rock 'n' roll as a threat to society, Coleman announces his plan to shut down Alan's upcoming concert.Later, Alan holds court at a bar with a stream of admirers. Alan runs into a disc jockey friend. He tells Alan that his show was taken off the air when he played rock 'n' roll. Just then, two of Coleman's associates, Phillips (Jack Edward Ellis) and Donahue (Richard Forbes), show up at the bar.

Meanwhile, Louise argues with her father, who wants her to go to college instead of pursuing her music career but Louise insists on doing things her way and performs a song on the piano.Back at the radio station, Overmyer pulls Alan aside and demands that the disc jockey sign an affidavit stating that he ""did not receive money or gifts,"" or ""payola,"" to play rock 'n' roll records, but Alan refuses. When Overmyer claims that disc jockeys across the country have signed the document, Alan insists that they are lying. Although Overmyer warns Alan that the station cannot legally protect him unless he signs, Alan retorts that they want to censure him for broadcasting rock 'n' roll, not for receiving bribes.The next night, teenagers line up outside the Brooklyn Paramount Theater in anticipation of Alan's show, waiting to buy tickets. Alan arrives at the venue to talk to his fans and to appease the concerns of police officers who fear another riot.

Meanwhile, a television news program reports on the long lines at the event and the anchor notes that the audience may resort to ""jungle instincts"" when the music starts.On the night of the concert, a raucous, multicultural audience enjoys the show as law authorities watch from the sidelines. Meanwhile, Phillips and Donahue search Alan's dressing room for marijuana, hoping to implicate him in a crime, but they come up empty-handed. During the show, Alan takes the stage and introduces Teenage Louise as an up-and-coming songwriter. When The Chesterfields perform her song, the crowd goes wild, and Louise is thrilled by her big break. As the show continues, Alan gets news that Jerry Lee Lewis is not coming as planned and, later, Alan comforts Louise as she cries that her love of music has isolated her from her family. The theater's box office receipts are seized by Internal Revenue Service agents and Alan is informed that he does not have the capital to pay the musicians.Sitting backstage with Chuck Berry, Alan questions if the show can go on and hears the crowd grow increasingly impatient. As Coleman looks on, a police officer orders Alan to quiet the crowd, but Chuck Berry offers to perform for free and takes the stage. As the audience cheers, Phillips warns Alan to control them. When Jerry Lee Lewis unexpectedly arrives, Coleman plans to take charge of the event by turning on the house lights. Thrilled by Lewis's performance, the crowd dances in the aisles, provoking Coleman to declare the event a fire hazard as he accuses Alan of turning the kids into animals. The police fight with audience members, including young Artie, and the lights come up in the theater, but Lewis demands that the lights be dimmed for the duration of his act. Lewis's defiance incites the crowd as Alan argues with the authorities, warning that the cancellation of the concert will not diminish the popularity of rock 'n' roll. As lights come up again, police officers and audience members clash and a full-scale riot ensues, despite Alan's protests.Outside, the crowd filters into the city as a lone street musician plays rock 'n' roll on makeshift drums."

For over a thousand years, humans from the Twelve Colonies (named Gemini, Caprica, Taurus, etc. as per astrological signs) have been fighting a war with the Cylons, a robotic race determined to exterminate humanity. The Cylons have unexpectedly sued for peace, through the diplomatic agency of a human, Count Baltar (John Colicos). The human leaders, called the Council of the Twelve (with one representative from each colony), and the commanders of their military fleet are all too pleased by the Cylon offer of peace, which ends so many years of warfare. The powerful battlestars are assembled for an armistice conference with humanity's age-old adversary.

Frustrated, Adama orders the Galactica's Viper squadrons be placed on full alert, with their fighters ready to launch. As the Cylons attack, the Galactica is able to launch her fighters first, while the other battlestars are caught off-guard. With President Adar aboard, the Atlantia is destroyed, as are obviously the other battlestars; the Galactica alone survives the Cylon assault. Apollo informs Adama that the Cylons were accompanied by refueling tankers, and Adama realizes that this would allow the raiders to operate far from their basestars, which must be operating somewhere else. He orders the Galactica to withdraw and protect the planet Caprica (Adama's homeworld), but they are too late, as the Cylon armada has launched simultaneous massive assaults on the Colonies at the very same time the attack on the battlestars has commenced.With the Colonies destroyed, Adama collects as many survivors as possible, and orders every intact civilian ship to take whatever survivors they can carry and follow the Galactica. A ragtag fleet is soon formed, and they head away under the protection of the Galactica to seek their fortune among the stars on the legendary thirteenth human colony. It is called Earth, but the location of this lost colony is known only to the last lord of Kobal, the planet which was the original home of mankind, but which was abandoned thousands of years earlier, when the Thirteen Tribes migrated to the stars. After initially escaping the Cylons across a massive starfield called the Nova of Madigon (referred to as such due to its extremely dangerous, hot environment, and Cylon minefield), the Galactica and the fugitive fleet find brief respite on the resort planet Carillon, where they hope to find food and fuel for their journey. As much of the fleet's food supplies were contaminated by pluton bombs during the Cylon attack, the fleet is in desperate straits, and must find a food source or face starvation.Determined that no human in any way shall survive, the Cylon Imperious Leader orders Baltar's execution after his services are done, but he is spared at the last minute in order to help the Cylons hunt down the human fleet. Meanwhile on Carillon, the local inhabitants (an insectoid race) agree to provide the fuel, and even offer to allow the humans to rest and recreate at a fancy casino/resort they maintain. This quickly becomes obvious that there is more to Carillon that meets the eye. The fact that Carillon has more than enough food and fuel for the fleet's needs makes Adama cautious. This is also obviously the largest tylium (fighter fuel) mining facility in that part of the galaxy, as well as a popular gambling resort, but nobody has ever heard of the place. Adama discovers that Baltar was responsible for performing the initial Carillon survey, reported that tylium was too minimal for mining, and he immediately smells a Cylon trap.But in the meantime, Sire-Uri (Ray Millland), Adama's self-serving nemesis on the new Council of the Twelve, uses the opportunity the planet presents for the morale of the fugitives to make his move against Adama, whose strict but selflessly benign intentions hinder his own ambitions.
Guided by Uri to believe that the Cylons have been far abandoned, the Council of the Twelve propose that the humans pause to celebrate their escape and dismantle their military and weapons to prove to the Cylons that humans are no longer a threat to them. The Council arranges a banquet, and orders all fighter pilots to attend. Adams suspect that this might be a golden opportunity for the Cylons to launch an attack on their fleet, and orders Colonel Tigh (Terry Carter) to secretly hold back their fighter pilots from attending the party while he is to outfit noncombat personnel with fighter uniforms.Down on Carillon, Apollo and Starbuck gradually discover that something is amiss when they see strangers walking around clad in the uniforms of their squadron, and after some investigation they discover the truth behind the planet's prosperity. The natives of Carillon, the insectoid Ovions, have arranged the gambling resort to lure humans to them to serve a living food for their hatching larvae in their underground chambers. They are also secretly in league with the Cylons and mine the tylium solely for their purposes in exchange for their freedom, and they are cooperating the Cylon's attempts to eradicate the human fugitives. During a subsequent fight with Cylon centurions, the laser fire from both parties sets the tylium mines on fire, threatening to destroy the planet once the fire rages deadly out of control.Adama's clever ruse works, and believing that all fighter pilots are at the banquet, the Cylons launch a raider attack against the Galactica in orbit, but Adama is ready to spring his trap. Once the Cylon raider contingent is fully engaged with the Galactica, Adama recalls all his fighters from the surface of Carillon, taking the enemy by surprise. During the fight, Apollo realizes the Cylon raiders couldn't have come so far without a basestar, and he and Starbuck disengage from the battle and find a Cylon basestar hidden on the far side of Carillon. In defiance of Commander Adama's recall order, they decide to attempt to destroy her, in order to enable the fugitive fleet to elude pursuit, and use fake radio chatter to deceive the basestar into thinking she's under attack by multiple fighter squadrons. The basestar descends into Carillon's atmosphere to avoid detection, and is destroyed when the planet finally erupts into a massive tylium explosion. However, despite their victory, the humans realize their enemies will still be pursuing them, as they leave for Earth, their last hope for survival."

tt0077270,"['Drama', 'War']","August 1967Five young men arrive at boot camp somewhere in the USA among a bus load of other U.S. Marine recruits for Company C for their induction into the Vietnam War. The five young men make up of: Tyrone Washington (Stan Shaw), an African American drug dealer from Chicago, Illinois; Billy Ray Pike (Andrew Stevens), a volunteer from Galveston, Texas; Alvin Foster (James Canning), an aspiring writer from Emporia, Kansas; Vinnie Fazio (Michael Lembeck) a street punk from Brooklyn, New York; and Dave ""Jesus"" Bisbee (Craig Wasson), a hippie war protester from Seattle, Washington. Alvin keeps a journal of his experience with the hope of being published some day and befriends Vinnie on the bus to training camp.As the men are processed, all of their personal possessions are confiscated, but Vinnie smuggles out Alvin's notebook and returns it to him. Alvin hopes to see combat so he can write about it. Once in the barracks, Tyrone warns the others to leave him alone.The next morning, training begins. Drill Sergeant Aquilla (Santos Morales) informs the recruits that if they do not ignore their racial prejudices and learn to rely on each other, they will not survive long in Vietnam. During training, Aquilla chastises Tyrone for not being a team player. Later, Vinnie notices some pretty girls and sneaks away. Billy also slips away to meet his girlfriend Betsy (Karen Hilger) who tells him she is pregnant. Billy encourages her to get an abortion because they are not ready to become parents.Back at training camp, Dave is shot in the arm as he attempts to desert and Alvin is accused of writing anti-American and anti-war propaganda; Vinnie, Billy, Dave and Alvin are sent to the brig for punishment. Their four replacements are racists and harass Tyrone, but when he complains to Sergeant Loyce (R. Lee Ermy), he is ordered to be cooperative because Loyce believes the young man's ""street smarts"" make him a natural leader. Loyce promises to bring Vinnie, Alvin, Dave and Billy back and transfer the racists out of the unit if Tyrone agrees to lead the company.In October, by the time training ends, Marine Company C has become a strong team and is assigned to Vietnam. Before they depart, Tyrone calls a drug dealer friend with a plan to smuggle back heroin. On their way to Vietnam, the soldiers meet their new commander, Captain Collins (Scott Hylands), who uses soccer to convey how the Viet Cong think.The company is under an enemy artillery attack as soon as their ship lands in Cam Ran Bay, South Vietnam and Collins volunteers the soldiers for a convoy to transport urgent materials to a field general. During the convoy, the company falls under an ambush attack by unseen Viet Cong and two men are killed and several more are wounded. When Dave is outraged to discover the ""urgent"" materials are cigarettes, liquor, food and other luxury goods, Collins insists he was not aware of their transport.The company makes it to the general's base and is rewarded with 24 hours R&R leave. As Vinnie and Alvin seek prostitutes, Billy is offered heroin by fellow soldiers and Tyrone talks to locals, hoping to find a drug dealing connection, but he is caught by the local military police and brought to Vietnamese Colonel Dong (Jose Mari Avellana), who accuses him of trafficking heroin. Dong is a drug trafficker himself and when he suggests that he and Tyrone become partners, Tyrone reveals his idea to smuggle the drugs in the body bags of dead soldiers.Later, Tyrone finds Billy overdosing on heroin and nurses him back to health, but he later berates his friend and fears he will put the company in danger. Meanwhile, Dave blows up the general's trailer of luxury goods as revenge. A little later, Vinnie discovers he has contracted a venereal disease from the local prostitutes and wonders why Alvin did not.When Company C is sent back into the combat area to replace another battalion, Captain Collins announces that the military's priority is obtaining a high body count of Viet Cong. In his effort to achieve the highest body count, Collins puts his troops in unnecessary danger, but is easy on Billy, because he is a great soccer player. Resentful, Tyrone disobeys Collins's orders during another Viet Cong attack but still manages to save the day. However, Collins punishes Tyrone by forcing him to lead his men into a dangerous rice paddy. There, Tyrone steps on a pressure release landmine and freezes in fear. Billy helps extricate Tyrone by replacing his weight with ammunition boxes. They both escape uninjured, but Tyrone is furious.One day, the company comes under another ambush attack by unseen Viet Cong on a river crossing bridge. When the enemy departs, the insane Collins orders an artillery attack on a village but Dave refuses to follow his order out of his worry of killing local civilians. Collins's more level-headed and sympathetic second in command, Lieutenant Archer (James Whitmore Jr.), sides with Dave and thinks it is unnecessary to launch any attack with poor knowledge of the area or about the enemy. Eager to increase his body count, Collin leads the attack himself; however, they discover only women and children in the village. Finding a young boy with a baseball, Billy starts an impromptu game.A little later, Colonel Trang (Vic Diaz) and Major Royal (Ken Metcalfe) interrogate the boy and promise Billy that they will not harm him, but after the company leaves the village, the men hear the boy screaming as he is shot to death. Furious, Billy announces he will never play soccer for Collins, provoking the Captain to punish Billy and Dave by reassigning them to patrol the mine-filled paddies.Later back at the fire base, Vinnie realizes Alvin never had sex with the prostitutes, and accuses his friend of being homosexual.Fed up with Collins, Tyrone reports a fake Viet Cong sighting and lures Collins out of his tent so he can kill the Captain under the pretense of ""friendly fire,"" but Archer stops Tyrone from shooting Collins and risk being court martial-ed and executed.Later, Colonel Trang finds Tyrone to discuss his drug smuggling proposition; however Tyrone is no longer interested and pretends Trang found the wrong man.Some time later in January 1968, Company C is sent to destroy an alleged Viet Cong technical operation center and Collins stays behind. During the attack, Alvin is injured by another unseen Viet Cong sniper and taken away by a medical helicopter, leaving Vinnie shaken. Archer soon realizes that Company C is being used as bait to draw out enemy fire, giving the artillery an excuse to counter attack and obtain a higher body count; he reports a false Viet Cong attack while he and the troops relaxes on the beach as they watch the bombing of an empty hill for several hours.When Tyrone complains about Collin's obsession with forming a soccer team, Archer explains that Collin's plan is to create a military team that will boost morale. If they can put together a winning team, they can leave combat. Tyrone tells Archer they need to get Billy back because he is their best player. Meanwhile, Billy and Dave have befriended local villagers. Billy agrees to play when he gets a letter from his girlfriend Betsy, who informs him she kept their baby, because now he has something to live for.At the climax, Collins organizes a soccer tournament with a local Vietnamese team. Dave brings some of the village children to watch. Company C names their team the ""Muthus."" Alvin, recovering from his injury, shows up to watch. When the Muthus gain the lead, Colonel Trang complains to General Sloan (Michael Cohen), claiming that it will hurt the country's morale if the Vietnamese lose. Sloan decides that it will be more politically advantageous to let the Vietnamese team win and orders the Muthus to throw the game. They follow orders at first, but Billy can't bear to lose. The Muthus win the game just as the Viet Cong attack. Collins is killed by enemy mortar fire, and Dave dies while avenging the death of the children he brought to the game by killing Colonal Trang, but get killed himself by Trang's bodyguards.As the attack comes to an end, Alvin sacrifices himself by throwing himself on an enemy grenade to protect other children. Vinnie and the others are shell-shocked but do not have time to mourn. With Collins dead, Archer takes over command of the company and orders them to rally because they are being sent back to combat for disobeying orders. Before they leave, Tyrone arranges for Billy to be sent home, claiming Billy has a head injury. The film ends with Tyrone and Vinnie rounding up what is left of the company and they all march off the soccer field and back into the combat zone to their new fire base location... which happens to be Khe Sanh."

In the year 2491, his shuttle is found drifting in space by the alien flagship Draconia, which is headed to Earth for a trade conference, under the command of Princess Ardala (Pamela Hensley) and her aide-de-camp, Kane (Henry Silva), a former native of Earth. Rogers is revived from his cryogenic sleep. Princess Ardala is visible attracted to Buck, but Buck rebuffs the Princess and is put back on his shuttle and sent towards Earth.It turns out that the Draconians are actually planning to conquer Earth through staged pirate attacks on Earth's shipping fleet, forcing Earth to seek a treaty with the Draconians and unwittingly opening up their defenses to the invaders. They plant a homing beacon aboard Rogers' shuttle to track a way to past Earth's planet-wide defense shield. Buck lands in New Chicago and is immediately taken into custody by Colonel Wilma Deering (Erin Gray), commander of Earth's military forces. He is interrogated and learns that Earth has been rebuilt over the centuries in his absence following a nuclear holocaust, and now the only thing left is this huge city surrounded by desert wasteland. Over the course of his time in detention, Buck makes the acquaintance of Dr. Elias Huer (Tim O'Connor) the leader of Earth's Defense Directorate, the AI computer Dr. Theopolis, and the robot drone Twiki (voice of Mel Blanc).While recounting his encounter with the Draconians, Buck notices several discrepancies and suspects that the Draconians must be armed, contrary to the terms of the trade meeting. Against advice, Buck ventures outside the city to the ruins of old Chicago in an attempt to find out that what he has been told is real, eventually finding his own parents' grave and having to be rescued by Wilma and her troops from the mutants inhabiting the ruins. Following Buck's return to the Inner City, the Draconian tracking device is found aboard his shuttle, and the authorities accuse Buck of espionage. Buck claims that the Draconians set him up, and eventually Wilma persuades Dr. Huer to test Buck's claims by requesting a meeting with Princess Ardala and Kane aboard the Draconia. The Draconian marauders attack their flagship as a diversion, but Buck manages to destroy them single-handedly, thus earning Wilma's respect.At the official diplomatic reception, Ardala, still attracted to Buck, invites him back to the Draconia, but Buck merely goes along to find out the truth behind the Draconians. On the flagship, Ardala says she needs ""a man, a real man"" to rule by her side and offers Buck the position. After drugging Ardala, Buck explores the flagship and discovers their plans to launch an imminent attack on Earth. Dr. Theopolis and Twiki, who have followed Buck aboard, eventually meet up with him and alert to the Draconian invasion.Wilma immediately scrambles Earth's starfighters and attacks the Draconia, while Buck sabotages the Draconian marauders prepared to attack Earth and fights off Ardala's bodyguard Tigerman. During the battle, the Draconia is critically damaged, but Buck, Theopolis and Twiki are rescued by Wilma before the ship explodes. Ardala and Kane also escape before the Draconia's destruction in a shuttlecraft, while Kane vows to return and to take his revenge on Rogers."
tt0077280,"['Biography', 'Drama', 'Music']","The film opens at The Buddy Holly Hayride presented by radio station KDAV in Lubbock, Texas in 1956. During the opening credits, Holly (Charles Hardin Buddy Holley's last name was misspelled on his recording contract, so he simply adopted the misspelling as his last name) and his fellow band members (The Crickets' names were changed to avoid legal action from Jerry Allison and Joe B. Mauldin. The group's rhythm guitarist, Niki Sullivan, was ignored by the film, as was the groups manager, Norman Petty), drummer Jesse Charles (Don Stroud) and bass player Ray Bob Simmons (Charles Martin Smith), set up their music instruments and test their sound equipment at Parker's Roller Rink.As the radio station prepares to broadcast live, a recording of country artist Lefty Frizzell singing ""If You've Got the Money, Honey (I've Got the Time)"" is heard on the radio. Holly's first number is a cover version of Les Paul and Mary Ford's recording of ""Mockingbird Hill."" During a commercial break, some of the younger members of the audience beg Buddy to play some bop. After the commercial Buddy Holly (Gary Busey) announces they will be performing the next number for the boppers (""Rock Around with Ollie Vee""). The youngsters enjoy it, but the older audience members cover their ears from the loud tone and one of the radio station's sponsors demands that Buddy be taken off the air or he will pull his advertising. The station's owner/disk jockey, Riley Randolph (Bill Jordan), actually thinks they sound pretty good and he likes the response from the youngsters. So, the guys perform another of their numbers, ""That'll Be the Day.""The next scene is in a church where the choir is sings ""When the Roll Is Called Up Yonder."" Buddy, his girlfriend, Cindy or Cindy Lou (Amy Johnston), and his parents are in the congregation. The minister comments on what took place the previous night at the roller rink. He declares that this new ""jungle rhythm"" music is un-Christian and un-American. As the pastor's harangue against music that he considers a threat to society continues, Buddy and his parents drive home in their pick-up truck.During Sunday dinner, Buddy discloses that he has decided not to attend seminary. His mother feels she and his father have been more than patient about his decision and have even allowed him to sow his wild oats by playing his music, but they would like to know what he plans for his future. He readily admits he has no idea.Out on a date with Cindy, they listen to rhythm and blues music (""In the Still of the Nite"" by the Five Satins) on KWKH, a radio station from Shreveport, Louisiana. Some of his band buddies interrupt Buddy and Cindy's love making session to tell Buddy that Riley is looking for him.When Buddy goes to the radio station, Riley gives him some records by several R&B artists because he can't play them on his station. Riley calls the music ""rock and roll,"" a title that he says was devised by Cleveland DJ, Alan Freed. He also tells Buddy that a vice president of World Records heard the roller rink show and wants the band to come to Nashville.On the trip to Nashville, the car radio plays ""Lisbon Antigua"" by Nelson Riddle and His Orchestra. They quickly turn the dial to find a station that plays R&B, but, when they can't find one, they turn the radio off. In the back seat of the car, Buddy plays his guitar and works on a new song using his girlfriend's name (the song eventually becomes ""Peggy Sue"").In the Nashville recording studio, Buddy records ""That'll Be the Day"" in the hillbilly style that the record producer wants. Jesse and Ray Bob furnish the background vocals, but Jesse isn't allowed to play his drums (drums weren't permitted in country music at this time) and Ray Bob isn't allowed to play bass; instead, a country band accompanies them. When Buddy finally objects, the producer tells him there ""ain't no such thing as a hit record with just three guys playin' in any kind of music."" Since the record company refuses to listen to Buddy's objections, they pack up and head home.Back in Lubbock, Buddy is ready to hang it up. Riley has had more negative feedback about Buddy's radio show from his sponsors. He tells Buddy he must only play country music or he will be forced to fire him. Buddy is determined to play his music. Before he departs, Riley tells him he sent his tape to a record company in New York (Riley had recorded a couple of tunes from the roller rink show).In New York, Coral Records executive, Ross Turner (Conrad Janis) is considering signing Buddy and his band. When the company's A&R man heard the demo of ""That'll Be the Day,"" he assumed Ross had purchased the master from another label. He thought the group had the most unique sound he had heard in years, so he had it pressed and released. The A&R guy advises Ross that he had better sign them immediately because the disc is already selling.Back in Lubbock, Buddy, Jesse and Ray Bob record ""Everyday"" in his garage. Buddy is bothered by a sound that they eventually determine is being made by a cricket. Buddy asks Ray Bob to get a glockenspiel from the high school band to use on the recording. Buddy's mother interrupts the session to tell Buddy he has a long distance call from New York.A Buffalo, New York DJ, Madman Mancuso (Fred Travalena), telephones Buddy to tell him that he has been playing his hit recording of ""That'll Be the Day"" continuously for the past fourteen hours and intends to play it until he breaks the world's record. When Mancuso asks about the instrumentation of the band, Buddy explains that it is only a guitar, bass, drums and a cricket, so the DJ calls them Buddy Holly and the Crickets.At Coral Records in New York, Buddy is very impressed with Ross Turner's secretary, Maria Elena Santiago (Maria Richwine). The band members' interest in signing a recording contract is peaked when Mr. Turner tells them they should each make about $25,000 from ""That'll Be the Day."" However, when Turner mentions assigning a top notch producer for their recordings, Buddy balks. After their previous experience with the producer in Nashville, Buddy demands to be the producer. Turner tells him that no artist is allowed to be his own producer, but when Buddy and the guys threaten to go to another record company, Ross gives in to Buddy's demand.Buddy and the Crickets are booked for a concert at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. The short-sighted Sol Gitler (Dick O'Neill) had signed them sight-unseen and assumed from hearing their music that they were African-American. Even though no whites had ever performed at the Apollo, Gitler wasn't willing to pay them for doing nothing, so he apprehensively allows them to perform. As they prepare to go on in their country and western-looking duds, Sam Cooke (Paul Mooney) sings ""You Send Me"" from on stage. When Buddy and the Crickets are announced and the curtain opens to reveal a trio of white guys, the Apollo crowd grows restless. However, Buddy's songs, ""Oh, Boy!,"" ""It's So Easy,"" and ""Rave On,"" quickly win the crowd over. During ""Rave On"" several couples dance in the aisles. King Curtis (Craig White) and another African-American sax player join the Crickets during an instrumental break.During their next recording session, the guys record ""Words of Love."" Afterwards, Buddy overdubs another guitar and vocal part. When Maria comes into the recording booth, Buddy gets so flustered that he flubs his vocal. Buddy has been sending her roses, but when he asks her out, she reveals that her aunt, who works in the publishing department, will not allow her to date a musician or a non-Puerto Rican.Back in the recording studio, Buddy and the engineers listen to the final take of ""Listen to Me."" Buddy refuses to give up on Maria, so he goes to visit her aunt. He tells Mrs. Santiago (Gloria Irricari) that he is a music executive at Coral. Buddy impresses Maria's aunt by asking permission to court her niece. Once she grants her permission, Mrs. Santiago surprises Buddy by knowing who he really is and complimenting his performance on Dick Clark's TV show, 'American Bandstand'.On their very first date, Maria accepts Buddy's marriage proposal and they are soon married (although the film doesn't show the wedding). After Alan Freed moves to New York from Cleveland, Buddy and the Crickets perform on Freed's Moondog's Rock 'n' Roll Party along with Eddie Cochran (Jerry Zaremba). When the M.C. introduces Eddie, the crowd is still chanting for Buddy, so Eddie calls him back on stage to join him and his band in Jerry Lee Lewis' ""Whole Lotta Shakin Goin On."" Jesse and Ray Bob want to go back to Lubbock, but Buddy thinks they need to stay near the music business in New York City.Backstage while they're waiting to perform on the 'Ed Sullivan Show', both Jesse and Ray Bob have had too much to drink. They also get in a little fight and Buddy loses a cap off of one of his teeth, which he patches with some chewing gum. Once Sullivan announces them, they perform ""Maybe Baby."" Shortly after the Sullivan show performance, Ray Bob and Jesse return to Lubbock. All three agree that the name, the Crickets, will go with them, so Buddy becomes a solo act. Turner tells Buddy he needs to go on tour to promote his new identity and his new album, but Buddy doesnt want to tour.At Christmas 1958, a neighbor boy brings a guitar he had received as a present to Buddy because, he said, it was broke. After Buddy tunes the guitar, he teaches the boy to play some chords by playing and singing ""Well, All Right."" After the boy and his friend leave, Buddy admits to Maria that he is scared to go out on the road again without the Crickets. After admitting his fears, he decides to go on the tour even though Maria is now six months pregnant.On February 2, 1959 at the Clear Lake, Iowa stop on the Winter Party Tour, J.P. ""The Big Bopper"" Richardson (Gailard Sartain), a DJ from Beaumont, Texas, performs his hit, ""Chantilly Lace."" From backstage, Buddy calls Maria to check on her and her pregnancy. Shortly after she hangs up the telephone, Jesse and Ray Bob knock on her door. They want to rejoin Buddy, but they aren't sure he wants them back. After Maria reassures them that he would welcome their return, they decide to meet Buddy at the next stop on the tour.Back in Clear Lake, the Big Bopper introduces Buddy, who sings ""True Love Ways,"" which was inspired by something Maria said to him. He dedicates the song to Maria. After that slow ballad, Buddy performs a medley containing all of his songs: ""That'll Be the Day,"" ""Oh, Boy!,"" ""Peggy Sue,"" ""Maybe Baby,"" and ""Not Fade Away.""At the end of the medley, the screen freezes on a shot of Buddy and the following statement appears on the screen: ""Buddy Holly died later that night along with J.P.

Then Hannah says Jenny can stay with Bill in Los Angeles, but only for six months. Hannah watches Jenny drive off with Bill.At the hotel's front desk, the doctors learn there is a reservation for Willis but not for Chauncey. The hotel has no extra rooms because it is Academy Award week. The only thing available is a small single room undergoing repairs. Chauncey agrees to take it. Later, Willis tells Chauncey that he has made a dinner reservation at a Japanese restaurant and booked them a tennis court for a doubles game the next day. While the Gumps struggle to get ready in their tiny room, Chauncey complains about having to eat Japanese food.

Lola calls Willis and insists he tend to Chauncey. Willis angrily acquiesces.Back in their hotel room, Diana jealously insists that Sidney was flirting with the young man that she saw him speaking with earlier. Sidney asks her why they cannot lie to each other about the nature of their relationship the same way they lie to everyone else about it. He reminds her that he has never hidden who he is... that he is homosexual. Diana asks why Sidney doesn't love her anymore. He insists he never stopped loving her. She says his kind of love doesn't do her any good, then begs him to ""screw"" her before immediately apologizing. She loves him but she doesn't understand why he stays with her when he could share the company of other gay men exclusively. He explains he enjoys his proximity to her minor celebrity and tells her he loves her more than any woman he's ever known. They acknowledge they have fun together, then share a kiss. She comes to bed and they make love.The next morning, Marvin wakes up to find himself in bed with Bunny. He tries to get her up and out of the room but she has passed out after drinking a bottle of tequila.

The farmer goes to see what has happened with a loaded shotgun. Voices are heard: an alien had to perform an emergency landing, and it has a limited time, up to 11:15 to solve the problem, because there won't be another spaceship in the Earth area for another 150 years.The army arrives immediately. They take the spaceship but they don't see the cat. They are interested in knowing what kind of energy it uses. Jake travels with the military men without anybody realising that he was there.The army asks for some scientists' help, including Frank Wilson (Ken Barry). He makes some fun comments, comparing the spaceship to an artichoke and saying that mayonnaise may possibly make it work. The female scientist, Liz (Sandy Duncan) feels outraged because of Frank's inadequate comments.When they are left alone, the cat (Ronnie Schell's voice) talks to Frank, and the first comment the cat makes is that Liz is obviously interested romantically on him. The cat says by telepathy that his name is SonarJ5amillion and something else - let's shorten it to Jake - and it says that his collar amplifies brainwaves. To make a demonstration, the cat moves with the power of his brain a cello and a he plays some music, turning the pages at the same time. Frank offers to try to mend Jake's spaceship. Frank also asks whether he could use the cat necklace and he is able to make himself levitate. A friend of Frank called Link (McLean Stevenson) arrives to see a Lakers basketmall match, because he has bet a lot of money on the Lakers. Jake makes the ball move through the basket to score the final winning point. Then Liz appears, and she sets a date ""for a picnic"" with Frank. Liz also brings Belle, her own lady cat, and recommends Frank to take Jake to the vet who lives in their building, which specializes on cats. Frank agrees and leaves quite abruptly.Jake is in a hurry: he only has 36 hours. Frank takes Jake in his arms and they get into the military building. They are discovered by a hounddog, but Jake freezes the dog and the military man with the power of his collar.They enter the spaceship and Jake tells Frank how to start the engine, which means that now he knows how that ""artichoke-shaped"" thing works. Frank gravitates because of the energy. A white-suited man, Mr Stallwood (Roddy McDowall) is following Frank and Jake, making funny faces while Frank gravitates.Jake has found the problem, he needs some weird thing nobody has heard about.

Everybody gets frantic. The second MP officer tells them that there is a cat intruder, and that he has found his necklace. Jake jumps, passes through the necklace, and leaves with it in Frank's lap.

Meanwhile, Link and Frank are interested only on the match. They get nervous when they are about to lose the game. Jake avoids the disaster, but dr Wenger gives a tranquilizer shot to Jake, who passes temporarily out.Link and Frank go out being watched by the military, who think that the maffia may get involved.

The ball jumps all over the shop. Tuna is Jake's favourite food. One of the onlookers is eating a tuna sandwhich, and its smell wakes Jake up.Earnest Ernie doesn't want to accept such a crazy bet. Frank says that he will bet his last bet: 60 dollars 2,000 to one, because Liz will play blindfolded, giving Weasel 12 strikes in advance and winning in only one strike.

tt0077394,"['Horror', 'contentRating', 'R']","Jerusalem, Israel. One week after the burial of Robert and Katherine Thorn (in the first Omen movie), archeologist Carl Bugenhagen (Leo McKern) asks his friend Michael Morgan (Ian Hendry) to deliver a box to the guardian of Thorn's young son, Damien. He reveals that Damien is the Antichrist and that the box contains a warning and the means to kill Damien. As Morgan is unconvinced, Bugenhagen takes him to the ruin of Yigael's wall, showing him an ancient depiction of the Antichrist with Damien's face. Morgan is convinced, but the two are buried alive as a tunnel collapses.Seven years later, 12-year old Damien (Jonathan Scott-Taylor) is living with his uncle, industrialist Richard Thorn (William Holden) and his wife, Ann (Lee Grant) at a large house outside of Chicago, Illinois. He gets along well with his 15-year-old cousin Mark (Lucas Donat), Richard's son, with whom he is enrolled in a military academy. However, he is despised by Aunt Marion (Sylvia Sidney), who favors Mark and thinks Damien a bad influence, even threatening to cut Richard out of her will if he does not separate the two boys. The same night, the appearance of a raven wakes her up and causes a fatal heart attack.Through a friend, Dr. Charles Warren (Nicholas Pryor), who is the curator of the Thorn Museum, Richard is introduced to journalist Joan Hart (Elizabeth Shephard), who was a colleague of Keith Jennings (from the previous film). Having seen Yigael's Wall and drawing a link to all the deaths that surrounded Damien, including Jennings', Joan tries to warn Richard but he throws her out of his limo. After a confrontation with Warren and Ann Thorn at the Thorn Museum, Joan became unsure on whether Damien's face matches the painting on Yigael's Wall. Joan goes to meet Damien at his school, but when she sees his face she drives off in panic. On the road, her car mysteriously dies down. When she gets out of the car, she is attacked by a raven, which pecks her eyes out, causing her to be run over by a passing truck.A few months later at Thorn Industries, manager Paul Buher (Robert Foxworth) suggests expanding the company's operations into agriculture; however, the project is shelved by senior manager Bill Atherton (Lew Ayres), who calls Buher's intention of buying up land in the process immoral. At Mark's birthday party, Buher introduces himself to Damien, invites him to see the plant, and also speaks of his approaching initiation.Buher seemingly makes up with Atherton, who drowns after falling through the ice at a hockey game on a frozen lake the following day. The black raven again makes an appearance at the scene. A shocked Richard leaves on vacation. As Richard agrees to the agriculture project in principle and leaves Buher in charge of the company, Buher then initiates plans on his own... revealing himself to be some kind of follower of Satan. Buher plots to buy up land in various Third World countries and use the weapon of famine to sell to the people the bought up crops at high prices.Meanwhile at the academy, Damien's new commander, Sgt. Dan Neff (Lance Henriksen), takes the boy under his wing and warns him not to draw any attention on himself until the right moment. He also points him to the Bible's Revelation, Chapter 13, in which Damien reads about the beast. Finding its number, 666, scarred onto his scalp, he flees the Academy grounds in a terrified panic, distraught at being chosen as the vehicle for Satan's will.A few days later, David Pasarian (Allan Arbus), an engineer at Thorn Industries, alerts Buher that some people were murdered after having refused to sell their land. Pasarian intends to inform Richard about his suspicions about Buher, but on the very next day, some chemical machinery explodes and releases toxic fumes, killing Pasarian and his assistant, and injuring Damien's class, who were visiting the plant. Damien alone does not suffer damage, but is taken to hospital as a precaution.A doctor named Dr. Kane (Meshach Taylor) investigates to why Damien was not affected by the chemicals. After taking a blood sample and examining it, Dr. Kane discovers that Damien's blood cell structure resembles that of a jackal. But before the baffled doctor can report this to anyone else, the unseen forces of darkness dispose of him too in another gory freak accident when he is cut in half by a falling elevator cable.Meanwhile, Bugenhagen's box has been found in the ruins and delivered to the Thorn Museum. When opened by Dr. Charles Warren, it contains the Seven Daggers of Meggido, the only weapons able to kill Damien, and the letter from Bugenhagen explaining that Damien is the Antichrist. Charles rushes to inform Richard as well as give him Bugenhagen's letter. But Richard angrily refuses to belive this and throws him out of his house. The next day, Richard confides in Anne with the letter after having read it, but she convinces him not to believe it.Mark, who overheard Richard's altercation with Charles, confronts Damien in the nearby forest, who first reluctantly and then proudly admits to being the Devil's son. Damien tries to convince Mark that he truly cares for him as his brother and asks Mark to join him, but Mark refuses. Damien kills Mark by introducing an aneurysm into his brain.Shaken by his son's death, Richard follows Charles' invitation to New York City. A half-crazy Warren takes him to Yigael's Wall, stored in a cargo carrier at a local railroad yard, on which Richard sees Damien's image. Immediately afterward, a switching locomotive hits the carrier, impaling Charles and destroying the wall, finally convincing Richard beyond doubt that Damien is the Antichrist.Upon his return to Chicago, Richard has Damien picked up from a ceremony at the academy and argues with Ann about Damien. As they find the daggers in Charles' office in the Thorn Museum, Ann uses them to kill Richard, proclaiming that she ""always belonged to him"". Ann is then engulfed by a fire, caused by Damien who overheard the altercation from outside. Damien, now the sole heir to Thorn Industries, exits the museum and is picked up by a driver as the fire department arrives. With all his enemies dead and under the tutulage of Satan's unholy disciples of Sgt. Neff and Paul Buher, it is clear that Damien is now on his way to becoming a world figure in controlling the world for the Devil."
tt0077402,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","Tensions are running high in the United States. The recently deceased are returning to life as shambling, flesh-eating ghouls, and political dissidents are threatening social stability. In the city of Philadelphia, Fran (Gaylen Ross) an employee of WGON-TV and Radio learns that her program director Givens is broadcasting out-of-date information about rescue stations that have been overrun by the living dead. Fran's boyfriend Stephen (David Emge), who pilots the station's traffic helicopter, arrives at the station and tells her that they must escape in order to survive. He plans on stealing the station's helicopter and tells Fran to meet him on the roof at 9pm.Meanwhile, in another part of Philadelphia, the city's SWAT team is preparing to launch an assault on a low-income tenement building filled with African-American and Hispanic refugees who refuse to leave their homes for emergency shelters; they also refuse to give up their dead, both deceased and re-animated, harboring them in the basement of the tenement. After a gun battle with armed bandits on the roof, the police and National Guard soldiers break into the building using tear gas. Roger (Scott H. Reiniger) one of the SWAT troopers, becomes disgusted by the bloodthirsty behavior of some of their fellow SWAT members when one of them, named Wooley, goes crazy and begins shooting at both zombies and innocent bystanders. A tall figure in a gas mask shoots the rogue officer dead.Roger retreats to the basement to escape the confusion, but the tall figure follows him. He removes his mask and reveals himself to be an imposing man named Peter (Ken Foree). They have talk for a few minutes and agree that the zombie plague will only get worse. Roger tells Peter about his friend who has a helicopter; he plans to leave with Stephen and Fran, and suggests Peter join their escape. The two SWAT men are startled when a elderly Hispanic priest emerges from a room in the cellar; the man is missing a leg and walks with a crutch. He tells them that he has administered the last rites to the dead people in the next room, and that the soldiers may now ""do what they will"" with them. Peter and Roger kill all the zombies in the cellar, the gravity of the situation nearly overcoming them.Meanwhile, Stephen and Fran arrive in their helicopter at an abandoned police station pier on the Delaware River to refuel and wait for Roger to show up. They are surprised when four rogue policemen arrive and threaten them for looting the place. Roger and Peter arrive and the rogue cops back down allowing the four to go on their way. Stephen and Fran are surprised that Roger has brought someone with him, but they agree to take Peter with them. The four of them fly all night.In the morning, Stephen lands the helicopter at a small, deserted rural airport depot to refuel. While exploring the area, zombies attack them from out of nowhere. Stephen tries to prove his manliness before Fran -- who is carrying his child -- but he is both clumsy and a poor shot. Roger has to kill the zombies Stephen weakly shoots at, and Stephen nearly kills Peter when aiming for a zombie.Later, while in the air again, they see a deserted shopping mall. They land on its roof and break in through a skylight to rest and to collect supplies. The place is full of zombies milling about inside -- the group theorizes that the undead were drawn to a place that had meant so much to them when they were alive. Despite the growing number of undead outside, the four refugees realize that they could survive there for a long time. It even has a gun shop so they will be able to find weapons to defend themselves. Using the mall's floor plans and master keys, Peter, Roger and Stephen race around the mall, collecting the supplies they will need to make a home. They take these supplies to an upstairs area where they and Fran build a home in an annex of former offices and storage rooms. Fran is resistant to the idea; she thinks it is a bad idea to leave what is left of society, but perhaps because she is pregnant and wants to do what's best for her child, she stays. She is later accosted by one of the zombies and insists that she never be left alone again and that they teach her to shoot properly so she can defend herself.The next day, the group realizes they need to rid the mall of zombies. A decision is made to block the entrances to the mall with semi-trucks from a nearby warehouse. While Stephen circles the operation in his helicopter, Peter and Roger hot-wire the trucks and drive them to the mall. Peter is disturbed that Roger seems to be losing his grip on reality; he becomes arrogant and takes unnecessary risks in order to demonstrate his mastery of the situation. Unfortunately, he is bitten by zombies while trying to get into one of the trucks. They all realize that Roger's wound will prove fatal, as nobody can survive a bite for more than a few days. Fran is conflicted; she wants to take Roger to a medical facility, but the others won't hear of it. They are convinced Roger is doomed but decide to let the ""disease"" run its course.Over the next several days, they begin to make the mall their home. They care for the ailing Roger as best they can, but his condition rapidly deteriorates until it is clear he is on the verge of death. Peter builds a fake wall in front of the only hallway that leads to their home, disguising it from any potential looters that may come through the area. They monitor a television to see if the zombie crisis ever ends but the news is dismal. Roger makes Peter promise to kill him if he comes back as a zombie, because he tells Peter he's going to try not to return. Roger does return, however, and Peter is forced to shoot his animated corpse in the head. They bury Roger inside of a large planter that houses decorative palm trees inside the mall.One night, Peter prepares a romantic dinner for Fran and Stephen. When Peter leaves them alone, Stephen proposes marriage to Fran. Fran declines, saying that they can't make that kind of commitment given what has become of the world. ""It wouldn't be real,"" she explains. Stephen seems to be depressed by her refusal.Over the next few months, the three survivors, Stephen, Fran, and Peter, have hauled various items from the mall (furniture, appliances, etc) in the office space as their home. Fran is now showing signs of her pregnancy as she walks around the windowless apartment. Peter is seen unhappily swinging tennis balls against a wall on the roof of the mall to relieve his boredom. By now, there are hundreds of zombies wondering around the empty acres of the parking lot that surrounds the mall.Eventually, all television and radio transmissions cease. The remaining three bicker as their sense of isolation and claustrophobia gets stronger. One evening, Stephen and Peter play cards using the worthless cash stolen from the mall bank, while Fran cooks them dinner. During the dinner, Fran becomes annoyed by the white noise static from the nearby TV set and asks to turn it off for there hasn't been a broadcast in three days. Stephen refuses to turn off the TV set. Fran gets up from the table and turns off the TV before returning to her place at the table. Stephen promptly rises and defiantly turns the TV back on. Fran then exclaims, ""what have we done to ourselves?!"" It is here that all three of them realize that the goods they have that meant something to the civilized world means nothing now. Their place of sanctuary is really like a prison for them.Earlier, Fran had demanded to learn how to fly the helicopter in case anything were to happen to Stephen. But during one of her lessons when teaches her how to fly it, they are spotted by a gang of motorcycle-riding survivalists who have been casing the mall.That evening, the survivalists/looters approach, coveting the supplies inside the mall. They try to contact Peter, Fran and Stephen by radio, but Peter is smart enough not to respond. He knows that they will be killed if the survivalists find them. His plan is to let the looters break in and take what they want, then leave, betting that they won't find the camouflaged entrance to their home. The looters break into the mall, and zombies flood in with them. Stephen, believing that the mall belongs to him and his friends, sneaks into the mall and tries to shoot the bikers, who return fire. With no choice but to help his friend, Peter creeps through air shafts, picking off isolated bikers and zombies. Unable to cope with both Peter and the zombies, the bikers decide to leave. Before they do, two of them enter the elevator where Stephen is hiding on top, and begin blindly shooting, severely wounding him. He is later attacked and bitten by zombies, and dies in the elevator. In the mall, the zombies corner and eviscerate several of the remaining looters.Peter returns to their hidden apartment and waits with Fran; they are unsure if Stephen has survived, but they know he will return either way. Now a zombie, Stephen remembers how to get through the hidden wall to the storeroom. He leads the horde of zombies up the stairwell. When the zombie Stephen appears, Peter kills him. He tells Fran to leave, refusing to go with her. He helps Fran onto the roof, where she prepares the helicopter. Peter stays in the storeroom, waiting for the zombies to flock in and planning to shoot himself before they can grab him. But at the last minute, he decides he wants to live and fights his way through the zombies to the helicopter. Fran delayed taking off until the last possible moment, and Peter is able to hop into the helicopter. The two fly off to an uncertain future, with little fuel left."

------
The films opening credits portray old photos of turn of the century America with a musical theme that recurs throughout the film, Carnival of the Animals The Aquarium by Camille Saint-Saens. Outside Chicago, Bill (Richard Gere) is shown firing up the furnace at a steel mill. He gets in a fight with the steel mill foreman (Stuart Margolin) and accidentally kills him. He runs away. His kid sister Linda (Linda Manz), begins narrating the story. She begins by recounting how things were that have not happened in the movie yet the days of heaven. Bill is helping his lover Abby, (Brooke Adams) with a cigarette as he explains that things will change for them eventually they are down on their luck. The three of them hop a train to Texas, where they sit with dozens of others on the roofs of the trains boxcars. Linda explains that she met someone once who told her that someday the world will go up in flames and the good people will avoid it, but for the bad people, God don't even hear you talkin'. Everyone gets off the train and Bill quickly negotiates a job working on a wheat field for $3 per day as a sacker. He lies about his experience as a ""sacker"" to get the job.All three get jobs as laborers on the vast wheat field of a farmer (Sam Shepard). Linda makes a friend (Jackie Shultis) in the wheat field. The farmer checks the quality of the wheat in the field to see if its ready for harvest. Prayers are said for a good harvest. Scenes of people using farming equipment follow. Linda narrates that the farmer is falling for Abby for some intangible reason. Bill has told everyone that Abby is his sister, and gets in a fight with a field hand who suggests otherwise. Bill and Abby share a moment in the shade of a wagon. Linda is shown plucking a pheasant. There are more scenes of the harvest. The farmer is shown asking questions of one of his workers about Abby. The farm foreman (Robert J. Wilke) comes by inspecting Bill and Abbys work and docks them $3 for wasting wheat when making bushels. Bill complains but the foreman threatens to fire him and Bill backs down. Bill is concerned about Abbys hands which are sore and rough from the work and wants to find the doctor. The men swim in a pond after the days work is done.Bill sneaks up behind the doctors wagon and steals some ointment for Abbys hands. While he behind the wagon he overhears the doctor explaining that the farmer has about a year to live. Linda narrates that the farmer knew he was going to die, and that people live only once so they should have it nice. The farmer finally speaks with Abby. She explains she is from Chicago. Linda roasts a peacock over a spit, as Bill tells her a joke: ""I saved your life today. I killed a shit-eating dog. I'm always lookin' out for you."" Apparently a joke by comedian Redd Fox - acknowledged in the end credits in the Thanks section. Bill and Abby have a talk in a haystack. Bill explains they will eventually go to New York and this is only temporary. The harvest continues on. Linda explains if people didnt work they were shipped right out they didnt need you. They could always find someone else. The farmers accountant explains its a 6-figure harvest, his best ever. The farmer gets up and takes a look at Abby through his telescope. There are more scenes of the harvest.The farmer comes up to Abby and offers her to stay instead of going on up north. She excuses herself quickly without answering to go talk to her brother. Bill and Abby splash around in a river. Bill begins to scheme. He suggests that she tell the farmer she will stay. There is a night scene of the harvest, the very end of it. Linda asks Bill if they are going to stay and he explains its up to Abby. Linda has a conversation with her friend about a worker who she was going with who abandoned her. Linda continues to narrate about Bill getting tired of living like the rest of them, like pigs. Bill figured some people need more than they got, and others got more than they need. It was a matter of getting everyone together. A man dances on a wooden plank to a tune played by harmonica. Bill and Abby continue their discussion about staying. A night time celebration with a bonfire and music occurs. Abby tells the farmer she can stay but shes got to keep her brother and sister with her. Lindas friend says good bye and many people leave on a train similar to the way they arrived. Linda questions Abby about why she wants to stay and she explains this isnt so bad to the way she had to live earlier, wrapping cigars, never seeing the light of day. The foreman questions Linda about what they did in Chicago before. Bill explains to the farmer a half-story about how he worked at the mill in Chicago. The farmer tells Abby he loves her. Bill begins to scheme.He suggests she marry him (since he is about to die). She is reluctant. The farmer and Abby get married along the river. The foreman is a joyless best man. The farmer and Abby take off of on their honeymoon. When they get back Linda explains they all never had it so good. The rich got it figured out. All four of them have a playful meal on a gazebo. They play makeshift golf. Bill sneaks Abby out of the house one night for some play in the river and tells her he never wanted to fall in love with her. They sneak in a bit late, after the farmer has begun calling for her. Life goes on. The foreman tells the farmer he thinks they are a couple of con-artists. The farmer takes offense and they have a falling out. The foreman quits and leaves and as he drives away, he stops to tell Bill and Abby he knows what they are doing and warns them that boy is like a son to me. The farmer senses some distance from Abby. A shot of a newspaper shows that president Wilson is on a whistlestop tour. They all go out to watch his train go by. Linda narrates that the farmer wasnt getting sicker as fast as they planned. Maybe the doctor gave him some medicine. Bill and the farmer go hunting for pheasant. The farmer remarks that Bill seems jumpy. Right during their conversation a Fokker tri-plane and a Sopwith camel come into a view as a flying circus lands right in their field. just as things were about to blow says Linda. The circus brings entertainment. Bill kisses Abby one night at the gazebo but the farmer sees it. He confronts Abby later about this strange behavior with her brother. She denies anything unusual but remarks to Bill that the farmer seems more paranoid. Bill is now angry that Abby seems to be in love with the farmer. Bill who is in a bit of a huff, gets a lift from the flying circus to take care of some business. The farmer and Abby are now alone.There are loving scenes between Abby and the farmer. Linda narrates that the farmer taught her the keys on the piano, the parts of a globe. Life continues. The following spring comes. The wheat begins to ripen. Bill comes back on a motorcycle and sees Abby dancing on the porch. Later, Abby apologizes to Bill. Bill explains he regrets not knowing what he had with her, and pushing her into this plot. Bill kisses Abby on his way to leave, and the farmer sees him from up on the roof with his weathervane. He seems a bit sickened.A close-up of a two locusts on some lettuce in the kitchen is a portent of a problem. They are shown bothering the birds. Things evolve rapidly. Abby begins swatting locusts all over the house. They are shown all over the wheat. A red storm flag is hoisted, and a warning siren is sounded, and the workers pile into the field to get rid of the swarm by any means possible. The farmer out in the smoking fields is suspicious of Bill and swings his lantern at him starting a fire. The fire spreads and starts to burn the entire field. Bill and Abby are silhouetted against the fire and she says, ""He knows"".The hands desperately try to put the fire out but it burns everything. The farmer aggressively intimidates Abby up in the bedroom, throws her down and gets a gun out of his desk. He ties her hands together and calls her a liar. The next day, the farmer is riding through his burnt out fields looking for Bill and finds him fixing his motorcycle. The farmer aims a gun at Bill but bill stabs him with a leather punch. The foreman finds the dead Sam Shepard. The three of them flee.They head down river in a boat. Linda narrates that no one is perfect, youve just got half devil and half angel in you. She explains that Abby will lead a good life from now on, she blamed it all on herself. Linda talks about all the things they see on the boat ride. In parallel action, the foreman begins to track them down.Wild turkeys gobble in the forest, where Bill, Abby, and Linda have camped. Bill walks under some trees, and notices police officers at their ferry boat at the river, presumably looking for him. They spot him and come chasing after him with dogs and horses. He gets back to the tent and grabs a shotgun. He tells them to keep down and then tries to run away as he is pursued. Eventually, he makes a run along the shore line and ends up in a gunfight. He is shot and killed by one of the pursuers on horseback. In her grief, Abby sobs over Bills body as detached people on the shoreline look on.The next scene is Linda in a dancing class. Abby has enrolled her in a dance academy. We dont know exactly how much time has passed. She tells Linda shell be all right, turn around and go inside. Abby walks to the train station through a small town. Young men are boarding a train to participate in World War I which the U.S. has just gotten involved in. A band plays a tune to bid the soldiers goodbye as Abby boards the train with the soldiers.The next morning, Linda escapes from the dance academy. She runs into her friend from the fields who has a new boyfriend. He's in the Army. Maybe he'll get killed or something. I don't know. Anyway, he said I'm pretty. They race away and chat at the railroad tracks, and then walk down the rails towards an uncertain future. Linda narrates This girl, she didn't know where she was goin' or what she was goin' to do. She didn't have no money on her. Maybe she'd meet up with a character. I was hopin' things would work out for her. She was a good friend of mine."
tt0077416,"['Drama', 'War']","In the Western Pennsylvania foundry town of Clairton, during the late 1960s, Russian-American steel workers Michael (Robert De Niro), Steven (John Savage), Nick (Christopher Walken), Stanley (John Cazale), John (George Dzundza), and Axel (Chuck Aspegren) are preparing for two rites of passage: the marriage of one and military service for three of them.They work together, hang out in a local bar and enjoy weekends deer hunting. But their placid life is soon to be changed after three enlist in the airborne infantry and go to Vietnam. Before they go, Steven marries the pregnant Angela, with whom he has not had sex, and their wedding party is also the men's farewell party. The hall is decorated with the boy's high school pictures and lots of American flags.Nick's girlfriend, Linda, makes breakfast for her father while wearing a bridesmaid's dress. Her father, an abusive and hallucinating alcoholic, is upstairs and alone, having an alcoholic attack and has trashed his room. Linda brings him his breakfast and he hits her a couple of times leaving a bruise on her face. She leaves for the wedding and takes her belongings to Nick's where she asks to stay for a while. Mike is upset and walks out when Linda shows up.At the Russian wedding reception, there is lots of drinking, ethnic dancing and wedding rituals. This is a very long scene and sets up the relationships and foreshadows some of what is to come. Mike spends a lot of the time at the bar drinking and watching Linda from afar. During the final ceremony of drinking from a dual wine cup, the convention is the couple will have a good life if they don't spill any wine but the camera catches some drips on the bride's dress. Nick proposes to Linda after she catches the bouquet and she accepts. The bride and groom leave the party in Mike's decorated Cadillac and Mike chases after them stripping himself naked as he runs, winding up with Nick in a basketball court. Nick makes Mike promise to bring him back to Clairton if something happens.The morning after, with the car still decorated from the wedding, the men drive into the mountains to go deer hunting. Mike takes hunting very seriously, having expressed his one shot theory to Nick previously, and gives Stan a cold shoulder when Stan wants to borrow socks and then can't find his hunting boots. He asks Mike for his extra pair and Mike refuses, having grown tired of Stan's lack of preparedness on previous trips. Frustrated, Stan pulls out a small handgun he carries and Nick breaks up the confrontation. The next morning, Mike and Nick go out into the woods and hunt (to Rachmaninoff's dramatic piece ""Praise the Name of the Lord""). Mike has told Nick he is the only one of the group he will hunt with, having no respect for the others. Mike stalks and shoots a deer, bringing it down in a single shot.The troupe returns to Clairton and they go straight to John's bar. John plays a somber piece on the piano and the men sit mostly silent, contemplating their last night together as a group.The story shifts to a mountainous region of Vietnam where a small village is a battleground. Michael is there, lying unconscious among some dead. A North Vietnamese Army (NVA) soldier walks into the village. He finds a small group of survivors, women and children, hiding in a hidden bunker. He casually arms a grenade, tosses it in and walks off as it explodes. Moments later he sees a woman, badly injured, carrying a baby. The soldier mercilessly shoots her. Mike springs up and blasts the soldier with a flamethrower. As Mike walks around shooting any surviving NVA soldiers, a unit of helicopters arrive and drop troops, among them are Nick and Steve. Mike, with a thousand-yard stare, doesn't seem to recognize them at first when incoming mortar shells from the NVA begin to hit the fields around the village. In the distance,a string of NVA are approaching.The three are captured and held prisoner in a crude riverside camp along with other US Army and ARVN prisoners. For entertainment, the guards force their prisoners to play Russian roulette and gamble on the outcome. Steven is suffering a mental breakdown and is chosen first. He pulls the trigger but the gun is aimed above his head, grazing him with the bullet. Though their captors laugh, he is punished by incarceration to a rat-infested partially submerged cage. Believing that the experience has broken Steven, Mike considers abandoning him in his planned escape attempt. Nick angrily rejects Mike's idea.Mike, convinces the guards to let him go head-to-head with Nick in the next round, after devising a plan to escape that requires three bullets in the pistol and shares his plan with Nick. Mike tells him to go after the closest gun when Mike makes his move. Mike successfully convinces their captors use three bullets in the cylinder. Mike raises the gun to his head and at the last minute pushes the rifles pointed at him aside while turning the gun on his captors. Mike and Nick grab their captors' AK-47s and kill them all before freeing Steve.The three escape the camp by floating downriver on a tree. An American helicopter patrolling the river attempts to rescue them, but only Nick is able to get inside and the other two hang from the landing gear. The weakened Steven falls into the river. Mike jumps in after him, and helps him to the riverbank. Steven yells that he can't feel or move his legs. Mike carries him on his back to a steam of refugees and convinces the South Vietnamese troops to take Steve on their jeep while he joins the bands of refugees fleeing the conflict.The mentally-devastated Nick recuperates in a military hospital in Saigon, where the psychologist concludes he is not fit to remain there. After he's released, he tries to call Linda in Clairton but hangs up before the call is connected. He wanders aimlessly in the red light district. Nick encounters Julién Grinda (Pierre Segui), a champagne-drinking Frenchman outside a gambling den where men play Russian roulette for money. Grinda entices Nick to go in. Unbeknownst to Nick, Mike is in the crowd, as a spectator. Nick interrupts the match, puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger and then leaves in a hurry with the Frenchman. Mike follows but can't catch them as they drive away and Nick throws the money the Frenchman offers him into the street.Returning to Clairton Mike avoids a welcome celebration and shows up to meet Linda alone. Nick is still missing. Mike finds out that Steve is alive and has returned from Vietnam and visits Angela, Steve's wife, to find out where he is. She is stuck in bed and non-communicative but writes down a number for him. It is the number for Steven's veteran's rehabilitation clinic.Michael reunites with Steven, who has lost both his legs and the use of an arm plus psychological damage. Steven reveals that someone in Saigon has been mailing large amounts of cash and carved elephants to him. Mike suspects the money is from Nick, who may still be alive and earning the money from Russian roulette gambling. Mike takes Steven home over Steven's protests.The boys go hunting and Mike hunts alone but can't go through with shooting the deer. He has another confrontation with Stan in the hunting cabin after Stan gets mad and aims his pistol at one of them. Mike takes his pistol and throws it away.Mike goes back to Saigon just before its fall in 1975 to find Nick. With the help of the Grinda, he finds Nick in a crowded roulette club, but Nick has no recollection of Mike or his home in Pennsylvania. Make tries to buy Nick from the gamblers. Mike and Nick end up pitted against each other in an attempt on Mike' part to help Nick remember who he is. Mike's attempts to jog his memory and persuade him to come home are unsuccessful and he notices track marks on Nick's arm, suggesting his minders are forcing him to use heroin to turn him into a mindless roulette player. Mike and Nick go through a few rounds of roulette until Nick raises the gun to his head and kills himself.The film ends with Nick's funeral back in America and his friends' response to it. Everyone's there, and even Angela and Steven seem to be on the mend. At the wake in the bar they all mournfully sing ""God bless America"", and toast Nick.""CAVATINA"" by Stanley Myers is played (on guitar by John Williams) as the credits roll."
tt0077438,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'Unrated']","SPOILER - - I thought the detailed description and photos I saw on another site made this movie appear much more interesting than it was. Even considering it was made in 1978. The movie opens to find the progragonist, Roberto Orbea in his car, looking down a short downhill street at two policemen, standing at the bottom of the street. He worries when they and the country will find out about ""the scandal."" For the next 15 or 20 minutes, which seems like forever, various figures in different scenes run through all the political charges which appear in his police file, scenes of implied brutal interrogations, sometimes even reading extensively right out of a file folder. For most viewers, 4 or 5 minutes of that would have been more than enough to set the tone. After that the next hour plus is a very boring look at his committment to politics, the struggle he has with his homosexuality, somewhat assuaged by his many trysts with very young rent boys. Of course I didn't expect porn, but the few decent shots of nude males were mostly either too dark to see anything or were obscured by the english subtitles. There is exactly one male/male kiss. All the while the few in the know including himself keep saying if they discover he's a homosexual, he will never be elected Secretary General. He toys with the idea of resigning. Supposedly he falls in love with the last rent boy, his wife decides she's had enough pretending not to know and they foolishly embark on a threesome, sexually and non-sexually getting photographed extensively by the opposition. The rent boy is interrogated about the photos, then kidnapped, and Roberto has to go to where they are holding him, Roberto's own secret apartment but when he arrives the boy has already been murdered. As the movie continues it seems he decided not to resign, the final scene shows a crowd and he with a few others are on a podium - apparently he was elected Secretary General after all. At this point the film abruptly ends and we have no idea what ultimately happens with the ""discovery of scandal"" (or if it even occurred) that loomed over the whole darn film. I did not enjoy this."

tt0077559,"['Action', 'Drama', 'Mystery']","The movie opens with Yang Tieh caring for his elderly teacher. The teacher is very ill and the treatments Yang Tieh administers are ceasing to be effective. Teacher believes that his time is up, and he is dying. He tells Yang Tieh that there is no longer time to put off what he needs Yang Tieh to do. He has been instructing Yang in the ""Poison Clan"" Kung-Fu technique, but he is dying now. He tells Yang that he had other pupils besides Yang, and is deeply concerned about what they are doing. Poison Clan kung-fu can be used to harm and oppress people, for many evil puposes. Many clan members have done so, earning the clan its bad reputation. Teacher tells Yang that he must tell him more about the previous pupils.Yang and Teacher descend into a dungeon-like area under the main room. Various training tools and structures, all old and delapidated, sit here, each with a large emblem of a different poisonous beast on the wall nearby. Teacher says he had five previous pupils. Number 1 studied the Centipede style, known for its exceptional speed of movement (he is shown rapidly smashing small plates dropping from the ceiling, most before they hit the floor). Number 2 studied the Snake style, known also for speed, and for its agility (Snake is shown smashing ceramic pots and moving limbo-style under a rack, smashing rungs out from underneath it). Number 3 studied the Scorpion style, based on the hands moving like scorpion pincers, and powerful kicking techniques (Scorpion is shown practicing these kicks and smashing wooden targets on high poles). Number 4 studied the Lizard style, which is agile and nimble and enables a man to climb like a lizard (he is shown running up walls and snuffing out candles). Number 5 studied the Toad style, which is based on power and resilience, and is near-invincible against physical harm (Toad is shown lying on a bed of spikes, pushing wooden spikes with his bare chest, and using forearm smashes to bend sheets of solid metal).Teacher explains that the pupils always wore masks while training, and changed their names after finishing. Moreover, they did not all train together-- Number 1 and 2 studied with him at the same time, and knew each other. Number 3 studied alone afterward, and never met any of the others. Numbers 4 and 5 studied together after Number 3 left, and knew each other, but never met the first three. Number 4, Lizard, was the oldest of the pupils. They will all use their skills only in times of dire need, making it even harder to find and identify them.Yang has studied the basics of all five styles but has not specialized in any of them, and thus his skills aren't enough to defeat the five pupils on his own. Teacher tells him that only be allying with at least one pupil who is not using his skills for bad purposes, can he hope to defeat any of the others who are. He makes Yang promise to locate the five pupils, and make sure they are not using their skills for evil. Any who are, must be faced.Teacher has one lead for Yang. He had a colleague who used to be a fellow Poison Clan teacher. He is living quietly in a nearby town under an assumed name. He has a lot of money made from Poison Clan activities. Teacher wants Yang to find this colleague and convince him to donate the money to a charity. The five pupils know about this money and may try to gain it for themselves. The colleague, although skilled in kung-fu, would not be a match for them.Yang makes his way to a small town, keeping his eyes and ears open. He notes that a police officer, He Yuan-Xin (though the surname is clearly dubbed 'Ho' in the English-language DVD), is very well-liked among the townspeople. He watches Officer Ho on patrol with his captain, Ma Chow, who seems polite and reasonably friendly but more businesslike than Ho.(space to be filled in later)Captain Ma is heading home in the evening when he passes by the workplace of an elderly scribe, Mr. Yuen. Yuen is clearly a well-liked and respected man throughout much of the town. Ma checks in on him and makes sure he is all right. Yuen is working a bit late that night but plans to head home soon.On arriving home, Yuen finds his entire family being held captive by two mysterious men who turn out to be Snake and Centipede. They are sure that Mr. Yuen is the fellow Poison Clan teacher who has the Clan's fortune. Snake and Centipede become a bit too overzealous in their interrogation of Mr. Yuen and beat him to death. Frustrated and intending to leave no witnesses, they slaughter Yuen's entire family, including the women and children, and leave empty-handed. As they are leaving, a town gambler and drunk named Won Fa spots Snake and Centipede. He barely manages to hide before they see him, paralyzed with fear.Some time later, Scorpion stealthily arrives at the Yuen's home. We do not see Scorpion's face as he is wearing his school training mask. He looks over the slain family and notices that Yuen is clasping a single candle in his hands. Taking the candle, he breaks it in half and finds a small piece of parchment inside, which he secretes into his clothing before leaving.When the bodies are discovered, the police begin investigation. The local judge is under pressure to have the case solved and closed promptly due to Mr. Yuen's highly respected position in the town. He puts the police under deadline after which they will all be whipped each additional day it takes. Ho has a couple of ideas and asks for some leave for official purposes.Officer Ho is discussing the case with his friend. They believe one of the Clan members may be responsible. Ho is now certain that Mr. Yuen was the Clan teacher who had the Clan fortune, and he was killed for the money. Suddenly Ho hears a slight noise outside the room where he and his friend are talking. He pulls open a casement, causing Yang to stumble in. Yang reveals that he has learned that Won Fa saw the Yuen family's killer.Cut to Won Fa being hauled into the police station. A kettle of hot tea is poured over his face to intimidate him. But then Officer Ho offers him a piece of silver in return for what he saw at the Yuen family's house. Instantly much more talkative, Won Fa says he saw a heavily bearded man come out of Yuen's house. Ho and several of the police know the man as a good friend of Qi Dong (dubbed Mr. Hung in the English language DVD), a wealthy aristocrat who is well-connected with local government officials.Ho is again speaking with his friend, who says he's also seen the bearded man. They are wondering if he is the Centipede, Snake, or Scorpion. Ho tells his friend that he needs to assist the police with the man's capture. When Ho speaks to the police about the plan, Ma is skeptical. Ho assures his fellow officers that his friend is a first-class kung-fu expert.Ho goes to visit. Mr. Hung the next day, dropping a subtle hint suggesting that Hung is involved somehow with the Poison Clan. Hung's face clearly changes but he pretends not to understand.Meanwhile, Ma and the police are waiting for Hung's bearded friend, Zhang Yiao-Tian (his name is dubbed just as Tian in the English-language DVD). Yang Tieh is hiding nearby to watch. The police surround Tian but cannot capture him. Finally Officer Ho's friend steps out of a door and identifies himself as Liang Shen (though the English language DVD clearly gives a dubbing of 'Li Ho.'), and accuses Tian of the Yuen family's murder. Tian leaps at Li, swinging a sword he'd seized from one of the police officers. Li doesn't budge, and the sword bounces off his naked arm, revealing him as Clan member number 5-- the Toad. Tian must use his Centipede skills to fight Li, revealing his own identity to Li and the police. Centipede and Toad battle in a well-choreographed kung-fu scene. Toad defeats Centipede, grappling him so the police can place him in chains and shackles. Ma asks Li to come to court but Li says it's not necessary.Yang walks off, having learned that the Toad and Centipede are in the town, but he doesn't yet know of any of the others.(space to be filled in at a later date)Li is placed in the Iron Maiden. Just as it is closed, he regains consciousness and busts out of the device, his body unmarked and unharmed. He chastises the police for their contraption, understanding what it is for, and saying he doesn't have a weak spot. The police cannot contain Li. Then Hung emerges from behind a curtain and engages Li in combat, using his Snake technique. Li notes the snake design on Hung's wristlets and understands who he is, and that he's behind the plot to frame Li. Snake and Toad battle in another kung-fu scene. Snake uses his skills to probe the Toad's body trying to find the weak spot. Toad is starting to get the better of the battle when suddenly two metal darts hit him from behind, sticking behind his ears. The darts are shaped like scorpions. Toad understands that the Scorpion is somewhere in the courtroom, but he cannot determine where. Snake begins to laugh and hits Toad hard in the same spots, behind his ears. Li's Toad-style kung-fu is broken and he is now helpless. The police put him in the Iron Maiden again and the judge demands he confess. Li simply passes out and falls unconscious. When he is removed from the Iron Maiden, his body is covered with puncture wounds.(space to be filled in at a later date)Officer Ho returns to town. Ma finds him at police headquarters, brooding and angry. He's learned that Tian was acquitted of the Yuen family's murder, and Li was convicted. He interrogates Ma about the turn of events, and Ma merely says that the case is now closed, and Li's crimes confirmed. Ho wants to see Li, but Ma says Li killed himself.Ho storms off to the tavern and orders all the patrons to leave. He begins to drink heavily when some of his fellow officers approach him, showing him the money they were given by Mr. Hung. They explain that Li was suffocated by an officer named Ling Xuong, after his kung-fu was broken by a device called the Iron Maiden (Ho's face changes to show he's heard of the device and understands why it was used). They also reveal how Won Fa and Officer Ling were eliminated as witnesses and collateral damage-- Won Fa was killed with a hook that was shoved down his throat, and Officer Ling was killed with a long, sharp needle that punctured his brain. Ho gives them back the bribe money so they can escape town quietly in the evening.He begins to drink again, when he spots Yang Tieh watching him. Yang simply smiles and reveals Officer Ho as Clan member number 4, the Lizard. He gives Officer Ho a Poison Clan password to show he's with the Clan. They go off to find privacy to talk.Yang explains how he figured out that Officer Ho was the Lizard. He also reveals that while drinking and gambling with various officers in the police force, he learned that Toad's kung-fu wasn't broken by the Iron Maiden, but by the Scorpion. They both know that Yuen was the second Poison Clan teacher, and was murdered for the Clan's fortune. It wasn't removed from his home, so Yuen must have had a map showing where the fortune is hidden.Officer Ho brings Yang to a secret area in town where he trains and keeps his Lizard-style technique sharp. Having training in all five main styles of the Poison clan, Yang shares his knowledge of the Centipede, Snake, and Scorpion styles, devising strategies for himself and Officer Ho to fight against them. They practice and hone these strategies well into the night. Since he is combining with the Lizard, Yang's battle strategy will involve using his own Lizard skills.The next day they are headed to Mr. Hung's mansion to confront and kill him and Tian. They find Captain Ma waiting for them on the way. Ma wants to help out. He understands what they want to do and believes that Hung and Tian will be tough to beat. Because of his friendship with Ma, Officer Ho agrees. As they start out again, Officer Ho notes that Ma is not wearing his police uniform. Ma states he's resigned from the force. Officer Ho decides that he will quit as well, pulling off his uniform hat and shirt and dropping them in the street.As they arrive, Hung looks closely at Ma and states, ""I wasn't expecting three."" Officer Ho calls Tian out and states his knowledge that Tian is the Centipede and Hung is the Snake. Lizard and Yang begin the big kung-fu battle with Centipede and Snake; the battle raging throughout the mansion and revealing Officer Ho's identity as the Lizard to Hung, Tian and Ma (we see Ma looking intently at Ho for a moment). During the battle, Tian is hurt and Lizard and Yang are able to team up against Snake. Frustrated and clearly on the losing end, Hung demands to know why Ma is just standing by and watching, saying he knows who Ma is.Understanding that his cover is blown, Ma suddenly lunges into the fight with a kung-fu kick that reveals himself as Clan member number 3, the Scorpion. In the sudden confusion, Hung turns and tries to run away, but Ma opens two hidden compartments on his belt where he stores his scorpion-shaped darts and hurls a handful of them into Hung's back. He demands to know how long Hung has known about him. Hung answers that he spotted Ma throwing the darts that broke Toad's kung-fu in the court battle. In answer, Ma throws another handful of darts that hit Hung in the chest and stomach. Officer Ho is aghast, admitting he was completely fooled. He understands that Ma, as the Scorpion, was seeking the Clan fortune for himself, and looking to kill all his fellow Clan members so they couldn't pursue him for it. His demeanor completely changed in an instant, Ma admits to all of this and that he has Mr. Yuen's Clan fortune.Yang and Lizard engage Scorpion in battle. Holding them off but knowing he can't take them both by himself, Scorpion calls to a recovered Centipede to assist him. When an appeal to logic (that Yang was sent by Teacher to hunt them down and will kill them both if given a chance) fails, Scorpion bribes him with half the money. That gets Centipede's attention and he rejoins the fight. Splitting Scorpion and Centpide up, Llzard and Yang fight to the best of their ability.Meanwhile, Snake is pulling the scorpion darts out of his chest and stomach and pulls himself to his feet, coming up behind Scorpion, who is starting to get the better of his battle against Yang. Snake strikes from behind, bursting Scorpion's stomach and abdomen. Scorpion instantly kills Snake with a high kick over his shoulder that smashes into Snake's forehead. But the damage to Scorpion is done. Lizard and Yang climb a wall, fending Scorpion off and allowing him to exert himself to where he dies of his wounds and blood loss.Centipede scrambles to try and find a clue to the Yuen fortune on Scorpion's body, but Lizard and Yang are waiting. Putting their strategy against the Centipede style into use, they finish Tian off and kill him.The battle over, Lizard pats Scorpion's body down and finds the map showing where Yuen hid the Poison Clan fortune. A disgusted Yang says they should kill the corrupt judge as well, but Lizard says that if they do this, the next one could be worse, and that the killing must stop some time. The best course of action is to use the map to find the money and use it well as their Teacher wanted, to pay the Clan's debts. The movie closes with Lizard and Yang leaving the mansion and the bodies of Centipede, Snake and Scorpion inside, to carry out Teacher's wishes."
tt0077572,"['Action', 'Drama', 'War']","In 1943, after their successful mission in Navarone, MI6 agents Mallory (Robert Shaw) and Miller (Edward Fox) are sent to find and kill ""Nicolai"". Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be a dedicated German spy, and is believed to be disguised among the Yugoslav Partisans as a Captain Lescovar (Franco Nero). Mallory and Miller's new mission is to get to Yogoslavia, find Nicolai, and kill him.To get to Yugoslavia the two men pair with ""Force 10"", an American sabotage unit led by Lt. Col. Barnsby (Harrison Ford) and having with its own mission in German-occupied Yugoslavia. To maximize security, Force 10 steals a plane from Termoli Airfield in Italy rather than requisitioning one, but are spotted by US M.Ps before takeoff. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MP's, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane. Barnsby and crew successfully ""escape"" Termoli only to be shot down by German night fighters over Yugoslavia. Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver and Reynolds (Angus MacInnes) manage to escape the crippled plane.On the ground, the five survivors run across a group they believe to be Communist Yugoslav Partisans, their allies. Led by a hulking Yugoslav named Captain Drazak (Richard Kiel), Force 10's rescuers are soon revealed to be collaborationist Chetniks (nationalist Serb guerrillas) under German control. The Germans take the team into custody, but do not know what their mission is. Mallory and Barnsby tell the German commander, Major Schroeder (Michael Byrne), that they are deserters and criminals fleeing Allied authorities. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's suitcase, which contains his special explosives, Mallory tells him that it contains a ""new"" drug called penicillin.The next morning, the prisoners are told that Schroeder has opened the case, finding it full of firewood. Mallory and Barnsby improvise, ""admitting"" they buried the samples. Schroeder sends Mallory and Barnsby out to retrieve them, under the guard of his concubine, Maritza (Barbara Bach), and three of his soldiers. Miller, Weaver and Reynolds are left in a cell in camp.Far from camp, Maritza kills the Germans, revealing herself to be a partisan spy. She directs Mallory and Barnsby towards the real partisans under the command of her father, Major Petrovich (Alan Badel). Mallory and Barnsby escape, ambushing and killing two of Drazak's Chetniks - men bandaged to hide burns from flamethrowers. Eventually, the two meet a patrol of real Yugoslav Partisans led by a man Mallory recognizes as his target Captain Lescovar, AKA: Nicolai. While Mallory assumes that Lescovar has recognized him, he and Barnsby are nevertheless taken to the partisans. Mallory and Barnsby both realize their location when they recognize a wide river and a large hydroelectric dam near the Partisan camp.Skeptical, Major Petrovich dismisses Mallory's story about Lescovar being Nicolai - assuring Mallory that they had executed the real 'Nicolai' months earlier. He reproves the men for killing the bandaged Chetniks, as the men were partisan infiltrators in the Chetnik camp and his only link to Maritza.Petrovich's principle worry is an impending assault by the Wehrmacht. The Germans are massing their forces nearby, and only a ravine separates as many as three German divisions from the outnumbered partisans. Only a single concrete arch bridge links each side of the ravine, but the partisans have been unable to destroy it. Convinced that no bridge is impregnable, Barnsby reveals that this bridge is in fact Force 10's target. Knowing Miller's expertise in demolitions, Mallory convinces a reluctant Petrovich to help mount a rescue mission using Lescovar and the Partisan Marko (Petar Buntic).The four re-enter the camp at night, Mallory and Barnsby posing as captives and the partisans disguised as the bandaged men. Before they complete their mission, Drazak arrives with the bodies of the real bandaged men and, since Maritza had always been seen with them, concludes she was a partisan as well and savagely beats her up. A gun battle breaks out in the cell block. Schroeder and Reynolds are killed, but Mallory, Barnsby, Miller, Weaver, Lescovar and Marko escape in a truck with a badly beaten Maritza and the recovered explosives.Having made it to the Partisans, Miller reveals that the bridge really is impregnable to explosives. Mallory hits upon the idea of destroying the upstream dam they saw earlier, with the sudden onrush of several millions of gallons of water being enough to destroy the bridge. A night time air drop is arranged to replace Force 10's lost supplies, but Lescovar sabotages the air drop by calling in German planes. Maritza spots Lescovar betraying the partisans, but Lescovar kills her before she can warn the others. German planes bomb the illuminated drop zone.Petrovich, angered by the botched air drop, orders the men to be sent to Marshall Tito's headquarters for transport back to Italy. The team decides to infiltrate the German marshaling yards at Mostar to steal explosives, taking Lescovar and Marko. Lescovar again betrays them alerting a German sergeant to their presence, identifying himself as an Abwehr officer. Marko overhears the plan and sacrifices himself to save the others from the Germans. The others escape with Lescovar aboard a train leaving for Sarajevo. Lescovar's hasty cover story doesn't fool Mallory or Barnsby; Barnsby had observed Lescovar's interactions with the German sergeant who, fatally, salutes the other man even though Lescovar's uniform only made him out to be a corporal; Mallory had noticed a map showing that their train passes within a half-mile of the dam - a fact Lescovar ""neglected"" to bring up. Though Lescovar denies treachery, Mallory is convinced, and he kills Lescovar.Jumping the train near the dam, the team splits up: Miller and Weaver set off diversionary explosives while Mallory and Barnsby sneak into the dam. Weaver runs into Drazak in the woods, and kills him after a knife fight.Mallory and Barnsby set their charges within the dam, but realize that they are out of time. With the German assault only minutes away - they are forced to set a short fuse, leaving them no time to escape. Mallory and Barnsby are caught in the explosion, yet nevertheless survive. The dam appears undamaged, but soon begins to disintegrate; with its barely maintained structural integrity disrupted, the dam wall collapses, releasing millions of tons of water in a wave that topples the bridge. The German assault is thwarted, saving the Partisans. Mallory and Barnsby rejoin Miller and Weaver, but the jubilation is short-lived. Mallory reminds the men that they're now trapped on the wrong side of the river, with no supplies and no way of contacting or reaching the partisans. As the end credits roll, the four men begin a strenuous journey back to friendly lines.In this movie appears Wolf Kahler who will later play Ludendorff, chemist and Fritz Shimon Haber's close friend in Haber (2008)."

From a conversation with a friend we learn that she is recently divorced and is shying away from dating men to avoid getting her heart broken again. Her friend urges her to become more social and for a few seconds she considers getting to know a stranger at the party played by Chevy Chase. Deciding he is a klutz and a bore she drives back to the city alone. As the opening credits roll we see her driving down the gorgeous Marlin County coastline in her yellow VW convertible as Barry Manilow sings the song ""Ready to Take a Chance Again.""When Gloria passes a handsome stranded stranger with broken down car, she decides to take a chance and pulls over to help. The stranger, Bob Scott (Bruce Solomon) asks her to drive him back to the city. On the way Scott notices that they are being followed by a black limo and decides to slip a cigarette pack, containing a spool of film, into Gloria's purse asking her to meet him at a movie theater later that evening. When she drops him off, we see two men jump from the limo and pursue him.When Scott finally reaches the movie theater, he sits down and we see he is hurt and bleeding badly. He dies shortly after whispering to Gloria ""Beware of the dwarf!"" She runs from the theater and gets the manager, but by the time they get back to her seat, the body is gone.Gloria tells this story to her elderly landlord Mr. Hennessey (Burgess Meredith), a retired anthropologist who keeps a ten foot snake as a pet, then heads upstairs to go to bed. The next day when she goes to work at the public library she also tells this story to her girlfriend, Stella, (Marilyn Sokol) who is convinced the whole thing is a hoax by a sex-crazed man, and insists the Gloria protect herself by carrying a portable alarm and a can of mace in her purse.As she is closing up the library that evening Gloria finds herself alone with an albino stranger (William Frankfather) who tries to kidnap her. She flees the building with the albino and another swarthy character, The Turk (Ion Teodorescu) in pursuit. Running into a bar she picks up Stanley Tibbets (Dudley Moore) and without telling him whats going on, asks him to take her to his apartment. There, Stanley misreads her intentions and prepares for a wild evening of sex, while she is distracted watching her pursuers out the window. When she finally turns around and sees Stanley in his underwear she is shocked and he is embarrassed. She heads home while Stanley mutters his apologies.Gloria is later assaulted at her apartment by a man with a scar on his face (Don Calfa), who demands she give him whatever was passed to her by Scott. He takes the cigarettes, and then attempts to strangle Gloria, but she stabs him with a pair of knitting needles (The cigarettes fall out of his pocket and lay hidden under a plant). Thinking she has killed him she calls the police, but as she turns around he is up again staggering toward her with murderous intent. The albino suddenly appears at the window and uses a throwing knife to kill the man with the scar and Gloria faints.She awakes to see the face of Chevy Chase's character, who we find is police Lt. Tony Carlson. Gloria tells him her story, but again the body has disappeared. Carlson's partner, Fergie, (Brian Dennehy) thinks she is nuts, but Tony is attracted to her and invites her to the station during her lunch hour.When she leaves the library to meet Tony for lunch she is kidnapped by the albino and the Turk. Waking up locked in a room she uses the portable alarm to get the Turk into the room and then maces him. She then climbs down the fire escape in the pouring rain and jumps to safely. Later she shows up at Tony's office, soaked to the skin and he takes her home.The next day Tony and Fergie check out the room where Gloria was held and find out that it was rented to someone named ""Stiltskin."" When Tony gets back to police headquarters he is informed that Stiltskin is the name of an assassin whose nickname is the ""The Dwarf"" and Scott was working undercover trying to find the name of the target. Suddenly Gloria's strange story makes sense and Tony heads out to her apartment to make sure she is okay.In the meanwhile Gloria has a visit from salesman J.J. MacKuen (Billy Barty). As he is a midget, she is terrified and misunderstanding his offer to connect her with eternity pushes him out the window, where he falls into a trash barrel and goes rolling down the hilly San Francisco street. When Tony arrives they open MacKuen's case to find he was an innocent Bible salesman.Gloria, Tony and Fergie head out to the residence of Archbishop Thorncrest, whose limo has been identified as the one used in kidnapping Gloria. The Archbishop (Eugene Roche) and his assistant Delia Darrow (Rachel Roberts), are busy preparing for a visit by the Pope and claim the car has been missing, taken by the chauffer, The Turk. When Gloria and party leave we find out that the Archbishop has been replaced by his identical brother. He and Darrow, Stiltskin, the albino and the Turk are part of an anti-religious conspiracy to kill the Pope.To keep Gloria safe Tony takes her to his house overnight: a fancy houseboat in Sausalito where they become romantically involved. The next day he takes Gloria home where Fergie is supposed to keep an eye on her while Tony heads out to look at where they found scarface's body. Fergie never shows up at Gloria's but she gets a mysterious call from him asking her to meet him at a deserted building next to a ""massage"" parlor. Stiltskin (Marc Lawrence) and company have kidnapped Fergie and forced him to make the call to trap Gloria. At the last moment Fergie yells a warning and Gloria escapes into the massage parlor hiding in one of the rooms where she again runs into Stanley. Stanley is mortified, but Gloria begs him to call the police and have the house raided. He finally does this, but Gloria is captured anyway while Stanley is hauled off to the police station.When Gloria and Fergie disappear, Tony decides to search the Archbishop's house with the help of Mr. Hennessey. Tony finds Fergie in the basement and a fight erupts between him and Stiltskin were Stiltskin is killed. Tony is captured and taken upstairs where he is tied up with Gloria. The archbishop imposter informs them that even with Stilskin dead, the albino, the backup assassin, will do the job by shooting the Pope from one of the organ bays during that evening's opera. Mr. Hennessey suddenly attacks and the archbishop imposter is knocked cold as a martial arts contest unfolds between the elderly Hennessey and the middle-aged Delia Darrow with the tied up Tony and Gloria watching. Hennessey finally wins and Tony and Gloria are released to make a hair raising race across the city (wrecking several vehicles in the process) to the opera house.They check the first organ bay and it seems empty, so Tony leaves Gloria there while he and the other police leave to check the other side. The albino comes out from where he has been hiding, however, and kidnaps Gloria, dragging her up into the catwalks above the stage while the opera continues below. The albino manages to shoot a pursuing policeman who tumbles over the edge and gets caught in the rigging of a sailing ship ""flying"" setpiece in the rafters of the theater. The albino is then shot by Tony, falls and is caught in the same way. The set suddenly drops down out of the ceiling at the end of the opera with the two dead men caught in the rigging. The whole theater sits in shock at this until the Pope, apparently thinking this is the way the opera is supposed to end, starts clapping and everybody else joins in. Tony and Gloria find each other and embrace while the crowd cheers. Down the orchestra pit we see the conductor is Stanley, who blanches at seeing Gloria, and slips on a pair of sunglasses hoping to avoid another embarrassing encounter with her."

tt0077617,"['Drama', 'War']","It's July 1964 in the period when American troops were euphemistically termed ""military advisors"" in Vietnam. Major Asa Barker (Burt Lancaster) has been given this command: a poorly-manned outpost named Muc Wa in rural South Vietnam somewhere near the rural Da Nang to Phnom Penh (Cambodia) highway that a decade earlier had been the scene of a massacre of French soldiers during the First Indochina War. Barker is a weary infantry veteran in his third war (he served in the Pacific during World War II as well as in the Korean War), who provides veteran supervision to a cadre of advisors attached to a group of South Vietnamese who garrison the deserted village of Muc Wa.Barker, as a seasoned officer, knows that he cannot defend his position due to lack of numbers and the quality of his local troops. He is still obliged to carry out the orders of his superior, General Harnitz (Dolph Sweet), who sends Barker U.S. re-enforcements to appease him. His command consists of a handful of U.S. soldiers (encompassing the inexperienced, unhappy, idealistic and glory-seeking) and some reluctant former Vietnamese paddy farmers turned militiamen. Barker is a capable commander who has ended his career by having an affair with a senior officer's wife. He argues that the hamlet is deserted and has no importance, but sends a detachment from his command. The detachment is commanded by the brash but nervous Lt. Hamilton, and includes veteran Sergeant Oleonowski, who is suffering from battle fatigue, a drug-addicted medic, Cpl. Lincoln, and a young draftee, Cpl. Courcey, who quickly befriends an elderly native volunteer, nicknamed ""Old Man"". The American troops along with around 30 South Vietnamese troops and similar number of milita, set out from their base as Pangan to Mu Wa. On their way to Muc Wa along a dirt road, the column is ambushed at a roadblock, resulting in the sadistic ARVN Cpl. Nguyen ""Cowboy"" (Evan Kim) capturing and beheading the lone Viet Cong attacker. On reaching the hamlet, Hamilton sets up his defenses in a triangular formation and receives supplies brought in by helicopter. At the rear of the hamlet is a graveyard of 302 French soldiers with a placard above the entrance that reads, in French, ""Étrangers, dites aux Spartiates que nous demeurons ici par obéissance à leurs lois"" (Stranger, tell the Spartans that we remain here in obedience to their orders), which refers to the Battle of Thermopylae. While he is investigating it, Courcey spots a one-eyed VC soldier, who is presumably a scout. Back at Barker's base, he receives a Psy-ops officer who claims that he will be able to predict which one of Barker's outposts the VC will attack next. During a patrol, Courcey spots a group of nine Vietnamese women and children fishing along the small river that runs through the deserted Muc Wa village, despite intelligence that there are no civilians said to live in the area. Cowboy wants to kill the civilians for they might be Viet Cong sympathizers, but Courcey stops him and lets the civilians take shelter in their base camp. Courcey befriends one of the civilians, a teenage girl, whom takes a liking to him despite the language barrier.That evening, the VC attack Muc Wa by a harassing attack where the doped up Lincoln is wounded. Coursey leads an ambush patrol that kills the four Viet Cong artillery crew.The next morning, Barker travels to Saigon to meet with Colonel Minh, the military chief of the region where he tries to persuade him to send reinforcements of at least 300 ARVN troops to Muc Wa. But the corrupt Minh refuses for he claims that he needs the troops to stay in Saigon to prevent a potential coup that may happen.The following night Muc Wa is again attacked by the VC, sustaining its first casualties when Lt. Hamilton is killed when he tries to rescue a wounded militaman, along with a few South Vietnamese soldiers. The next day, Sgt Oleonowski commits suicide rather than face the pressure of command. When Barker is informed of the deaths, he wants to pull his troops out now that they lack an experienced leader, but this request is refused by Harnitz, forcing Barker to send his own deputy to Muc Wa. When the psy-ops man predicts Muc Wa will be attacked, Barker contacts them by radio only to learn that they're under attack from the Viet Cong.True to Barker's predictions, the outpost is attacked again by the massive numbers of Viet Cong who number in the many thousands, not the few hundred predicted by the high command, and they are all well armed with various automatic weapons, not outdated rifles. Barker is forced to threaten Harnitz over the radio to send air support for Muc Wa in which several helicopters and flare ships arrive just in time to stop the Viet Cong attack.The next day, Barker receives orders by Harnitz to withdraw all of the American troops from Muc Wa which is believed to be under siege by a 1,000-strong 507th Viet Cong battalion. Barker personally flies out to Muc Wa to evacuate the surviving Americans as well as the wounded, but leaving behind the South Vietnamese troops, including the walking wounded. The idealistic Courcey refuses to leave the wounded, so Barker stays behind with him to help evacuate the remaining South Vietnamese troops and militiamen overland to safety. This leaves Barker, Courcey, Cowboy, the Old Man and his fellow South Vietnamese militiamen at Muc Wa. That evening, the Vietnamese civilians that Courcey found and brought into the base camp steal several weapons and try to escape, forcing Cowboy to kill all of them. But the Vietnamese teenage girl gets away and informs the Viet Cong scouts of the American's plans to withdraw... thus revealing that she and all of the other civilians were in fact Viet Cong supporters (as Cowboy predicted) after all.Barker and Courcey are forced to blow up all of the arms and equipment left behind and then leads the group on the road away as friendly artillery fire begins raining down on the area. But no sooner has the group filed out, they are ambushed on the road by the Viet Cong, led by the civilian girl. In the ensuing battle everyone is killed, including Barker who tries to help Courcey when he is wounded. Barker then collapses and apparently dies from a heart attack, while the Old Man drags Courcey to hide him in the nearby bushes as the enemy Viet Cong attack from all directions. The only survivor of the battle is ironically the willing volunteer, Courcey, whose idealism and enthusiasm for the Vietnam War has now been killed along with all his comrades. He wakes up after the battle in the morning to find that everyone else is dead and the soldiers, including Barker, are stripped of their fatigues. The VC have withdrawn having left him for dead. As Courcey wanders to the grave site, he finds another survivor: the wounded, one-eyed VC scout that he saw earlier. The VC points his rifle at Courcey before dropping it out of exhaustion. Courcey says to the one-eyed VC, ""I'm going home, Charlie, if they'll let me"" as he wanders off the grave site and onto the dirt road leading away from the ruins of the village."

Scenes from their holiday are shown, but then the summer ends, and Sandy and Danny say their last good-byes. Danny seems to not want to let Sandy go, but Sandy is due to return to Australia. She is upset, thinking that this is the end of their romance and that they will never see each other again. Danny tries to comfort her by telling her that ""it's not the end, it's just the beginning"".However, Sandy's family has a change of plans and does not return to Australia, but Danny is unaware of this. Sandy enrolls at Rydell High School as a foreign-exchange student, where Danny is a student, as is Sandy's new friend Frenchy (Didi Conn), a member of the schoolgirl clique ""The Pink Ladies.""Danny is the leader of the boys' gang, ""The T-Birds."" Kenickie, second-in-command of the T-Birds, encourages Danny to tell them what he did over the summer, while the Pink Ladies likewise persuade Sandy. Through ""Summer Nights"" Sandy and Danny describe their vacation, and it is made clear that Danny is exaggerating; at the time, however, neither is aware of the other's presence at the school.Encouraged by the preppy school spirit girl, Patty Simcox (Susan Buckner), Sandy joins the Rydell cheerleaders. The Pink Ladies decide to reunite Danny and Sandy, but Danny wants to protect his cool image, and his behavior towards Sandy causes her to storm off in tears. Danny stares after her for a moment, but then quickly turns back into a cool guy and goes off with his friends.Frenchy attempts to cheer Sandy up by inviting her to a sleepover at her house with the rest of the gang; Sandy comes along, but Rizzo soon gets fed up with Sandy's goody-two-shoes behavior: Sandy chokes on a cigarette, cannot stand the taste of wine, and is horrified at the idea of having her ears pierced. Frenchy insists and takes her into the bathroom, but Sandy vomits at the first sight of blood. Frenchy announces to Jan (Jamie Donnelly) and Marty (Dinah Manoff) that she is dropping out of Rydell and going to beauty school, which she calls a very strategic career move. Rizzo (Stockard Channing) has had enough and lampoons Sandy, and even Frenchy joins in, singing the sarcastic ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee.""The T-Birds arrive outside Frenchy's house. Rizzo leaves the sleepover and she and Kenickie (Jeff Conaway) flirt, then Kenickie invites her into the car, and dumps the other T-Birds. Danny leaves of his own accord while Rizzo and Kenickie drive off together and the other T-Birds go for pizza. Marty, the flirtatious member of The Pink Ladies, decides to write to one of her (numerous) pen pals, while Sandy goes outside, and decides that in spite of everything, she still loves Danny, singing ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"", a poignant love song that was added for the movie and was a big hit as a single.The scene shifts to Rizzo and Kenickie making out passionately in the back seat of his new car. They plan to take things a step further, but Kenickie's condom breaks. Rizzo, however, is unable to resist Kenickie, and they decide to have sex anyway. They are soon interrupted by Leo (Dennis Cleveland Stewart), leader of rival gang The Scorpions, who damages Kenickie's car.While at work repairing the car, the T-Birds fantasize about what it will look like when it has had a paint job, singing ""Greased Lightning"". Soon Danny gets the other T-Birds convinced that the rickety old car could actually be a ""major piece of machinery"". Later, Danny meets Sandy at the Frosty Palace, and tries to apologize for his actions. He sees that Sandy is sharing a soda with Tom Chisum (Lorenzo Lamas), a jock, and decides that if that's the sort of man she likes, he's going to join the jocks to impress her.We next see Danny's disastrous performances in basketball, wrestling, and baseball, where he keeps losing his temper. He finally finds his ideal sport in running, until the sight of Sandy distracts him, and he falls. Sandy leaves Tom Chisum to see if Danny is alright, and they are seemingly reconciled.Danny attempts to go to the Frosty Palace with Sandy so that they can be alone and not worry about ruining his image in front of his friends. They end up discovering the T-Birds and Pink Ladies are already there and Danny finds it hard to charm Sandy without looking weak in front of his friends. After everyone leaves the malt shop, Frenchy, who has been hiding her pink hair under a scarf, imagines a guardian angel to tell her what to do with her life, who turns out to be Frankie Avalon singing ""Beauty School Dropout"".Later, Danny takes Sandy to the school dance, where the TV show National Bandstand plans to broadcast live. Rizzo, now angry with Kenickie, takes the rival gang's leader, Leo, to the dance, thus enticing Kenickie to take the rival gang leader's girlfriend, Cha Cha DiGregorio (Annette Charles) who is also Danny's ex-girlfriend. The disc jockey Vince Fontaine (Edd Byrnes) is attracted to Marty and the two flirt. The dance features several well-known songs from the '50s covered by Sha Na Na. During the dance-off, Rizzo leaves in a huff, seeing Kenickie dancing with Cha Cha, and Danny and Sandy are one of the few couples still in the dance-off. But soon, Sonny pulls Sandy away from Danny, and Cha Cha starts dancing with Danny. Sandy realizes that Cha Cha was one of Danny's past girlfriends and a much better dancer. Sandy leaves the gym upset, and Danny and Cha Cha end up winning the contest. When they share their spotlight dance, three of the T-Birds run in front of the camera and moon the crowd.Later, Danny takes Sandy to a drive-in movie. Danny tries to remove the class ring he is wearing to give it to her, but in doing so he accidentally elbows Sandy in the chest. Danny gives Sandy the ring and she kisses him on the cheek, saying she realizes now he respects her. The scene cuts to Marty and Rizzo in the drive-in's restroom. Rizzo's unprotected sex with Kenickie has come back to haunt her--she tells Marty she missed a period. One of the T-Birds, Sonny (Michael Tucci), overhears Marty accidentally proclaiming to couples making out outside the restroom to make way for the ""lady with a baby"", and asks Marty what she meant so she tells him the story and the rumor spreads quickly. When Kenickie asks Rizzo why she didn't tell him about it, she lies and tells him it isn't his out of anger. He thanks her sarcastically, and leaves her standing by herself. Marty has also suffered as a result of her crush on Vince Fontaine--she reveals to Rizzo that she caught him trying to put an aspirin in her Coke.Back in the car Danny has his arm around Sandy. His hand lingers above her chest and she sees it and he starts trying to make out with her. She screams, gets out of the car, slams the door on Danny, throws back his ring (which she calls a ""piece of tin""), and leaves the drive-in. Danny laments losing Sandy again, and reveals the true extent of his feelings for her in the song ""Sandy"" he is helpless without her.The next scene is the race between Leo and Kenickie in the Los Angeles River. Kenickie asks Danny to be his second, and Marty gives Kenickie a lucky penny. She drops it, and as Kenickie bends down to pick it up, he gets knocked out when one of the T-Birds opens the car door. As a result, Danny has to race in Kenickie's place. Sandy sits on the hill watching the neck-and-neck race, which Danny manages to win. While she is happy to see Danny win, she has misgivings about her own image, reflected in the song ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee (Reprise)"". As the T-Birds and Pink Ladies celebrate with Danny, Frenchy spots Sandy and goes over to her. Sandy thinks that Frenchy can help her win Danny's heart, and asks to go over to her house to take advantage of Frenchy's suspect fashion skills.On the last day of school carnival, Danny arrives, wearing a letterman's sweater (earned through track) over his usual black attire. Sandy arrives wearing a black leather jacket, red peep-toe high heeled sandals, skintight black pants, off-the-shoulder top, curled hair, and smoking a cigarette abandoning her usual modest clothing. Danny finds her extremely attractive, falling at her feet, and then the two reunite, singing the upbeat ""You're the One That I Want"" (another song added for the movie, and a hit single before the movie even came out). Kenickie and Rizzo get together after Rizzo screamed from the Ferris wheel that she is not pregnant after all, and everyone sings the big finale, ""We Go Together"", and Danny and Sandy fly off in Danny's car and disappear into the sky."

tt0077651,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","The film opens with a brief opening title/credits sequence showing a Jack-o-Lantern accompanied by John Carpenter's famous theme music. The shot slowly moves closer and closer. Once it stops, the lighting quickly changes to reveal that the eye and nose form the shape of a man holding a knife.The film begins on October 31, 1963, a cold Halloween night in Haddonfield, Illinois. In the middle of a street stands a two-story white Victorian house. Someone begins walking toward it, and sees a 17-year-old Judith Margaret Myers (Sandy Johnson) through the front door, kissing her boyfriend (David Kyle) passionately. As they move towards the couch in the living room, the person outside follows them around the side of the house and watches through the window. The boyfriend asks Judith if they are alone and she replies that someone by the name of Michael is around someplace. Her boyfriend puts on a clown mask jokingly and kisses her. She laughs and tells him to take it off and he suggests that they go upstairs to have sex. They run up the staircase as the person outside the house follows them back around to the front. The Shape sees the light in the upstairs window go out and begins swiftly walking back to the side of the house through the kitchen door. Quickly, the Shape opens a drawer and grabs a very sharp knife. It begins slowly creeping through the dining and living rooms and reaches the bottom of the staircase. There, Judith's boyfriend is putting his shirt back on and leaving the house. Judith calls down the staircase for him to call her the next day. He takes one last look upward and quietly leaves. As soon as this happens, the shape begins walking up the stairs into the dark hallway. Looking down, it sees the clown mask on the floor. The Shape picks it up and pulls it over its face. Entering Judith's bedroom, it sees her sitting in front of her mirror, nude except for a pair of panties, brushing her hair. She has her back to the shape and is unaware that it is standing there. The Shape walks up behind her and she finally feels its presence. Swirling around, she sees that it is Michael (Will Sandin), the person previously referenced, and is annoyed, quickly covering her breasts. But suddenly, Michael raises the knife and begins stabbing her repeatedly in various areas of her body. After a few seconds, she falls to the ground, covered in blood. Swiftly, the shape walks out of the bedroom, down the stairs, and out the front door into the yard as a car pulls into the driveway. They are Mr. and Mrs. Myers, Judtih's parents. Seeing Michael, they pull off his clown mask, revealing the face of a young 6-year-old boy staring into space with a blank expression, still clutching the knife in one hand.On October 30, 1978, nearly 15 years later, in Smith's Grove, Illinois, a doctor by the name of Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) and his assistant, a nurse named Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens), are driving to the local sanitarium to have Michael Myers, now 21 years old and still very dangerous, taken to a hearing in front of a judge, where his future incarceration will be determined. In the car is a matchbook with an advertisement for the Rabbit in Red Lounge. As Marion quietly smokes a cigarette, she questions Dr. Loomis's desire to do this when suddenly, they see that several mental patients are lurking around the entrance to the sanitarium. Dr. Loomis rushes out of the car into the rain to see what is going on just as a patient leaps on top of the car. It is Michael Myers (now played by Nick Castle). Marion rolls down the window to see what he is doing up there and his hand reaches through the window and grabs Marion's hair, causing the car to swerve off the road. He and Marion struggle for a moment until she pulls away and moves toward the other side of the car. Instantly, Michael's hand appears at the window behind her and shatters it. Marion, startled, opens the car door and jumps out. Michael climbs in and drives away. Dr. Loomis runs over to Marion and consoles her, telling her that the evil is gone.The next day, on Halloween in Haddonfield, a young girl of about 17-years-old named Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is leaving her house to walk to school. On her way out, her father Morgan Strode (Peter Griffith), a real estate agent, tells her not to forget to drop a key off at the old abandoned Myers house because a family is coming by to look at it later. As Laurie continues down the streets, an 8-year-old boy, Tommy Doyle (Brian Andrews), walks up to her. Laurie is babysitting him that night. As they walk together, the Myers house comes into view. Tommy tells Laurie not to go up there because something bad happened there once. As she drops the key under the mat, someone appears inside and looks through the front door at her. Laurie leaves and continues walking with Tommy, who says he received the information about the house being haunted from Lonnie Elamb (Brent Le Page), whom Laurie says will probably never get out of the sixth grade. Tommy leaves soon after this, and Laurie walks on, singing to herself, when suddenly, the Shape from inside the Myers house appears right behind, staring after her.Meanwhile, back in Smith's Grove, Dr. Loomis is debating with another doctor, Terence Wynn (Robert Phalen), about whether or not Michael has returned to his hometown in Haddonfield. Dr. Wynn doesn't think Michael could drive to Haddonfield and blames Dr. Loomis for not warning the staff about the potential for Michael's outburst. Dr. Loomis angrily gets in his car and drives away.Later that day, Laurie sits in English class at Haddonfield High School when she sees the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car parked on the street outside the window. Michael stands beside it, in a greyish-white mask, watching her. Laurie is frightened and continues to look back, when suddenly, the teacher calls on her to answer a question, startling her. Laurie responds to the question, and when she looks back through the window, Michael and the car have disappeared.Meanwhile, at the Haddonfield Elementary School, the bell rings, and children begin running out of the building. Tommy is leaving school carrying a large pumpkin, followed by several bullies who are taunting him about how the boogeyman is coming to get him that night. Tommy is confused, not knowing about the boogeyman, but is also frightened. He begins to run away, but he trips and falls, squashing the pumpkin. The bullies laugh and run out through the playground gate, when instantly, Michael jumps out and grabs one of them. Terrified, the bully scurries away. Michael climbs back into the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car and begins to drive alongside Tommy, who is walking down the sidewalk sadly. Michael then drives off.On the highway somewhere between Smith's Grove and Haddonfield, Dr. Loomis stands at a telephone booth, speaking with someone from the Haddonfield police department, who seems resistant to the idea that Michael could be coming to Haddonfield. Dr. Loomis, frustrated again, hangs up the phone. But before he can drive away, he notices a tow truck parked nearby in a grassy area. Inside, he finds Michael's white hospital gown and the Rabbit in Red Lounge matchbook. Now Dr. Loomis is sure that Michael is in Haddonfield and rushes back to his car, not noticing the unclothed body of the tow truck driver (Barry Bernardi) lying in the nearby grass.Meanwhile, the students are being released at Haddonfield High School. Laurie is walking home with her friend Lynda van der Klok (P. J. Soles), who's complaining about how many school activities she will have to be involved with in the next day, being such a popular and beautiful girl. Laurie, however, seems to be a quiet bookworm who has nothing to do except babysit. As they walk along, another young girl named Annie Brackett (Nancy Loomis) finds them. Annie and Laurie talk about their babysitting assignments for that night; Laurie is babysitting Tommy, and Annie is babysitting Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards), who lives across the street a few houses away. While they are talking, the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car goes speeding down the street. Annie yells down the street at the driver that speed kills and, suddenly, the car stops but instantly speeds back up and leaves again. Forgetting this matter and not realizing that they had a close encounter with Michael, Annie and Lynda share a cigarette and begin devising a plan to get Lynda and her boyfriend, Bob, together at the Wallace house where Annie is babysitting to have sex.Laurie and Annie continue on, when suddenly, Laurie sees Michael hiding behind a bush ahead of them. Annie doesn't see him, and when she rushes over to the bush, there is nobody there. Annie thinks that Laurie is seeing men behind bushes because she is desperate for a date. Annie reaches home, leaving Laurie behind, who still thinks that there was someone behind that bush. Looking behind her, she accidentally runs into Mr. Brackett (Charles Cyphers), Annie's father and the sheriff of Haddonfield. Laurie is startled, and Brackett , the local sheriff, replies that it is Halloween and everyone is entitled to one good scare. Laurie laughs and walks back towards her house. Walking into her bedroom, she looks out of the window and sees Michael standing in her neighbor's back yard, staring up at her from between two rows of clothes hanging on a line. One second he is there, the next second he is gone. Suddenly, the phone rings, and Laurie runs over to it. When no one answers and she only hears the sound of chewing, she hangs up, terrified. The phone rings once again and it is Annie on the other end. She asks why Laurie hung up on her and she replies that she thought it was an obscene phone call. Annie says that she had her mouth full and couldn't speak, telling Laurie that she will be picking her up for their babysitting assignments at 6:30 pm. Laurie hangs up and lies on her bed, trying to console herself. Later that day, Annie picks Laurie up at her house to go babysitting, and they drive around for a while smoking a marijuana cigarette.Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis arrives at the Haddonfield Cemetery with the graveyard keeper (Arthur Malet), apparently with the intent to visit Judith's grave. They discover that Judith's headstone is now missing; Dr. Loomis knows now there can be no doubt that Michael is somewhere in Haddonfield.Back in Annie's car, the girls smoke marijuana and talk. Laurie tells Annie about seeing someone in her neighbor's back yard, while behind them Michael, still driving the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car, slowly cruises down the road, stalking them. Laurie begins to cough after smoking the marijuana when suddenly, they spot Mr. Brackett in front of a store in the distance and Annie orders Laurie to get rid of the joint. They pull into the parking lot and speak with Mr. Brackett, who says that someone--probably kids--broke into the store and stole a few masks, ropes, and knives. Annie replies that he blames everything on kids and that he is a cynical father. Mr. Brackett dismisses them because they will be late, and they leave down the street toward their baby-sitting assignments. After they leave, Dr. Loomis pulls up to the store and asks to speak with Mr. Brackett, who says it will be about ten minutes. Dr. Loomis stands waiting on the sidewalk as the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car passes right behind him.In Annie's car, Laurie is worried that Mr. Brackett knew that they were smoking pot, and Annie thinks there is nothing to worry about. They begin discussing next day's school dance, and Laurie reveals to Annie that she has a crush on a boy named Ben Tramer. Soon after this, they arrive at their destinations. Annie drops Laurie off at the Doyle house and pulls into the driveway of the Wallace house. As she walks into the house, the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car pulls up along the curve. Michael gets out the car and hides behind a tree in the Wallace yard, watching Annie.Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis and Mr. Brackett arrive at the abandoned Myers house. They begin to search inside, when they find a partially eaten dog (off-camera). Mr. Brackett says a man couldn't eat a dog like that, and Dr. Loomis replies that this isn't a man. The two of them walk upstairs, and Dr. Loomis shows Mr. Brackett the bedroom where Judith was murdered. Suddenly, a downspout falls away from the building and breaks the window near them, startling Dr. Loomis, who draws his gun. He begins describing his 15-year experience of watching Michael, seeing nothing but ""pure evil"" inside him. Mr. Brackett asks what they should do, and Dr. Loomis tells him to inform the rest of the police, just to ask them to keep their mouths shut. Dr. Loomis decides to stay behind and wait for Michael because he thinks he will return to the Myers house.At the Doyle house, Laurie sits, reading King Arthur to Tommy. Tommy becomes bored and says that he doesn't like that book and reveals several comic books that he has been hiding in the couch, saying that his mom doesn't want him to read them. Soon after this, Tommy asks Laurie what the boogeyman is, but suddenly, the phone rings before she can reply. It is Annie, calling from the Wallace house. She tells Laurie that she just spoke with Ben Tramer and told him that Laurie was really attracted to him. Laurie becomes angry and embarrassed, and begs Annie to say that she didn't talk to him. Right at this moment, Tommy looks out the window and sees The Shape standing next to the Wallace house, a black silhouette. He screams for Laurie that the boogeyman is outside, but when Laurie looks out the window, no one is there, and she continues her conversation on the phone. At this time, Michael has reached the back of the house near the kitchen door. Inside, Annie is in the kitchen making popcorn, not noticing Michael. She complains about Lester, Lindsey's dog, bothering her with his barking. Suddenly, Annie accidentally pours the butter all over her shirt and pants, and removes them while Michael continues to watch. Annie finds a small button-up shirt and puts it on, wearing nothing else other than panties. At this moment, Michael accidentally knocks a hanging plant to the ground, shattering it and drawing Annie's attention to the kitchen door. But Michael has gone to another window when Lester, who is now outside, sees him and begins barking. Annie complains to Lindsey again that Lester is getting on her nerves, but soon after this, she hears Lester stop barking and begin whimpering. Outside, Lester is dangling in the air and his feet are starting to go limp as Michael kills him.Inside the Doyle house, Laurie and Tommy sit watching The Thing. Once again, Tommy asks Laurie about the boogeyman. Laurie says that the boogeyman and all other Halloween superstitions are all make-believe and that Halloween is only a time when people play tricks on each other. Seeing that Tommy's still afraid, Laurie promises that she won't let anything happen to him. Tommy asks to make the jack-o-lantern at this time and they go into the kitchen. At the Wallace house, Annie goes to the outdoor laundry room in the back yard and puts her clothes in the washing machine, never seeing The Shape peering in at her from the door and windows. After accidentally locking herself inside, Annie calls for Lindsey to come and let her out, but Lindsey doesn't hear her. When the phone rings, Lindsey answers it and it's Annie's boyfriend, Paul (an uncredited John Carpenter). Lindsey finds Annie stuck in the laundry room window and releases her. After they go back into the house, Paul calls again and tells Annie that his parents left his house and he has an opportunity to sneak out to see her. He asks her to come pick him up. Annie takes Lindsey across the street to the Doyle house so Laurie can watch her for the time being. Laurie is reluctant, but Annie promises to talk to Ben Tramer in the morning and tell him that they were just fooling around when she called him. Finally, Laurie agrees, and Annie goes back to the Wallace house. She enters the garage, whistling and singing to herself, and tries to open her car door, but it is locked. Frustrated, Annie goes back into the house and finds the keys, brushing her hair a bit in the mirror, and still wearing nothing underneath her coat except a shirt and panties. Reentering the garage, she opens the car.... not noticing that it is now unlocked. Just as she sits down in the driver's seat, she realizes what has just happened. She reaches up to wipe the fog from the windshield, when suddenly, Michael leaps out from the back seat and grabs her throat. He mercilessly strangles her until she weakens and then swiftly withdraws a knife and slits her throat. Annie's eyes go wide as her face slides down the window, and she dies.Inside the Doyle house, Tommy and Lindsey are watching television when Tommy hides behind a curtain and whispers Lindsey's name, trying to scare her. Tommy turns around, and, to his horror, he sees Michael carrying Annie's lifeless body back into the Wallace house. Suddenly, Lindsey bumps into Tommy and they both scream. Tommy yells for Laurie, saying that they boogeyman is outside again, but she tells him to stop talking about it. Tommy complains that no one believes him, but Lindsey decides that she will.Meanwhile, at the Myers house, Dr. Loomis stands waiting behind a bush. After a while, three children, one of whom is Lonnie Elam, come along and dare each other to go inside. Trying to protect them, Dr. Loomis speaks in a menacing tone and yells at them to go away. They scurry away from the house and run down the street. Suddenly, Mr. Brackett jumps out behind Dr. Loomis, startling him. Mr. Brackett complains, telling Dr. Loomis that it will take more than fancy talk to keep him up all night crawling around bushes. Dr. Loomis warns him once again of Michael's evil, and Mr. Brackett questions if all the families and children in Haddonfield could be lined up for a slaughterhouse. Dr. Loomis replies that they could be. Mr. Brackett agrees to continue looking for Michael in the case that Dr. Loomis is right, but he adds that if he is right, ""Damn you for letting him go.""Back at the Wallace house, Lynda and Bob arrive in a van, both sipping from cans of beer and are considerably drunk. They go over the plan that Annie will distract Lindsey while they go to the bedroom upstairs to have sex, not knowing that Lindsey is at the Doyle house and that Annie is dead. Bob lifts Lynda into the air and carries her into the house. Once they go inside, they find all the lights off and no one there. Seeing this as an opportunity, they fall onto the couch, kissing passionately, while Michael silently watches nearby.At this time, in the Doyle house, Laurie, Tommy, and Lindsey have finished carving the jack-o-lantern and walk into the living room, making spooky noises. They all sit down on the couch to finish watching the movie, when suddenly, the phone rings. It is Lynda calling from the Wallace house while lying on the couch with Bob's head in her lap. She asks where Annie is; Laurie replies that she went to pick up Paul, and she thought she'd be home by this time. Laurie tells Lynda to call when Annie gets back because she has Lindsey at the Doyle house, and she needs to know what time to put her to bed. Enthusiastically, Lynda hangs up the phone and tells Bob that Lindsey is gone for the night, and they run upstairs. Laurie watches as the lights go out across the street.Upstairs in the Wallace house, Lynda and Bob Simms (John Michael Graham) are having sex while the phone rings continuously. Lynda warns Bob not to answer it for fear it might be the Wallaces. Bob takes the phone off the hook and they resume the moment, not noticing Michael's shadow sliding across the wall. Soon after this, they stop, and Lynda lights a cigarette for each of them, ordering Bob to go downstairs for a beer. She giggles as he goes downstairs, this being the best night of her life. Downstairs, Bob gets two beers out of the refrigerator and is about to pour them into glasses when he hears a noise. He looks outside through the kitchen door, but no one is there. Annoyed, he opens the pantry door when suddenly, Michael jumps out and shoves him against the set of cabinets on the opposite wall! Michael lifts Bob into the air, stabs a sharp knife through his stomach and into the wall, and Bob dies. Michael stands there for a moment, watching Bob's lifeless body like a curious animal. Upstairs, Lynda sits filing her nails when the bedroom door creaks open and Michael stands there, covered with a sheet and Bob's glasses over his eyes. Lynda thinks this is Bob dressed as a ghost and asks him where the beer is. He won't answer, so she drops the sheet around her, exposing her breasts. When the Shape still won't answer her, she becomes annoyed and gets up to call Laurie and ask where Annie and Paul are. She dials the number, but just as she is about to speak, Michael comes behind her and strangles her to death with the telephone cord! At which time she screams, leaving Laurie thinking it is Annie playing a prank. Finally, after Lynda dies, Michael picks up the phone, listening to Laurie's voice. She puts the phone down and looks out the window as all the lights in the Wallace house turn off. Laurie dials the number for the Wallace house, but no one answers. Going upstairs, Laurie sees that Tommy and Lindsey are sound asleep.Meanwhile, back at the Myers', Dr. Loomis still stands waiting, when suddenly, he sees the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car! Dr. Loomis begins running down the street, sure of where Michael is. At the Doyle house, when Laurie still receives no word from anyone, she grabs her keys and curiously ventures across the street. Upon reaching the front door, she finds it locked and rings the doorbell. There is no answer. Laurie walks around the side of the house to the kitchen door. Going inside, she searches around for any signs of Annie, Lynda, or Bob, thinking this is a trick. Not finding them anywhere, she walks upstairs and sees the light from a jack-o-lantern streaming underneath the bedroom door. Opening it, she sees in horror Annie's lifeless body on the bed with Judith Myers's headstone above her. In tears, Laurie backs against the closet when suddenly, Bob's body drops down into the doorway, hanging from the ceiling. Laurie screams in terror just as the closet door opens, revealing Lynda's body as well. Laurie runs out of the bedroom into the hallway, backing against the wall. Out of a darkened room, Michael's mask appears in the doorway behind her. Laurie walks forward, standing against the balcony.... when Michael reaches out with his knife and stabs her in the shoulder! Laurie screams louder than ever and falls over the balcony railing, crashing down onto the staircase and spraining her ankle. Michael rushes over to the top of the stairs and begins walking toward her. Laurie leaps up and rushes towards the front door hurriedly, but it won't budge. She runs through the living room to the kitchen, locking the door behind her. She rushes to the kitchen door, the way she came in, but a rake has been shoved under the doorknob outside. She is trapped! Suddenly, Michael's hand breaks through the other door behind her as he turns the lock and enters the room. Terrified, Laurie smashes through the glass with her bare hand and knocks the rake over. Shoving the door open, she runs out of the house and stumbles into the yard. She screams for help and runs onto the porch of another house, but no one will help her. Hurrying across the street to the Doyle house, she reaches for the keys in her pocket, but they are gone! Panicking, she bangs on the door, but Tommy is fast asleep. Just then, Michael appears behind the Wallace house and Laurie begins to yell for Tommy. Grabbing a potted plant, she throws it at Tommy's bedroom window, waking him. He slowly walks downstairs, unaware of the trouble. Finally, he reaches the front door just in time and lets Laurie in. She locks the door and orders Tommy to go upstairs. Turning out the lights, Laurie believes that she is safe, when instantly, she sees in terror that a window is open. Scared beyond imagination, she crouches down in front of the couch when suddenly, Michael leaps out from behind the couch and tries to stab her, but he misses and hits the couch instead. Laurie grabs a knitting needle and swirls around, stabbing Michael in the neck. He staggers backward and hits the floor, apparently dead. Laurie, nearly passing out because of blood loss, drops the knife that is still in the couch onto the floor and goes upstairs to check on the kids.Outside, Dr. Loomis still walks down the sidewalk when Mr. Brackett's police car pulls up. Dr. Loomis tells him that he found the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car and he will head over to where Michael is. Mr. Brackett drives away, now truly believing what is going on.Upstairs at the Doyle house, Tommy and Lindsey run up to Laurie, thinking that it was the boogeyman who attacked her. She assures them that he is dead, but Tommy says that she couldn't have killed him because he is incapable of being harmed. At this moment, Michael lumbers toward them, and Tommy and Lindsey run back into the bedroom. Laurie scurries into another room, opening a set of doors leading to the balcony and, hiding in a closet, tries to fool Michael as to where she actually is. She ties a pair of stockings over the closet's doorknobs, but Michael soon begins shaking the doors and reaches through them with his knife, slicing the stockings! He breaks down the top half of the closet door and reaches in for Laurie, accidentally turning the light on. Laurie grabs a wire hanger and stabs Michael in the eye with its point. He jumps back in pain, dropping the knife into the closet. Laurie takes it, clutching it in her hands, and stabs Michael in the chest. He falls to the ground, dead. Laurie carefully slips out of the closet and, seeing this, drops the knife. Asking Tommy and Lindsey to come out, she tells them to go down the street to the McKenzies' house and tell them to call the police. They leave the house, screaming, attracting the attention of Dr. Loomis, who is outside and runs up to the Doyle house.Inside, Laurie is slumping against the doorway of the room where she was hiding, tired and almost unconscious. She doesn't notice that Michael, thought to be dead, is slowly rising behind her. Laurie stands up, leaving the room, when suddenly, Michael grabs her by the neck and begins to strangle her. Laurie fights back and pulls his mask off, revealing Michael's true face. Instantly, Dr. Loomis appears at the top of the staircase and shoots Michael with his gun. Michael falls backwards into another room as Laurie falls against the wall behind her, covering her ears. Dr. Loomis chases the murderer into the other room and sees him standing in front of the balcony doors. Dr. Loomis shoots him five more times, causing him to fall out the doors and off the balcony. Michael slams onto the ground below, appearing to be dead. The doctor looks back at Laurie, who says, ""It was the boogeyman."" Dr. Loomis solemnly replies, ""As a matter of fact, it was."" Looking back down below, he sees in horror that Michael has vanished, but Dr. Loomis knew all along that this would happen. Laurie realizes that Michael still is not dead and begins sobbing. The film ends with a shot of the Myers' house and the sound of Michael breathing heavily behind his mask.Michael Myers, the legendary man who came home on Halloween night to kill, is still alive somewhere out there..."

Away from the football field, he focuses on fitness and relaxes by playing the saxophone. On Joes birthday, Max Corkle, a Rams trainer and Joes good friend, drops by his home with a cake and informs him that the coach wants Joe to start the game against the Dallas Cowboys instead of Tom Jarrett. Joe steps up his training, but while bicycling through a tunnel he is hit by a van. With saxophone in hand, Joe arrives at a way station to Heaven accompanied by The Escort, a celestial assistant who instructs Joe to board an aircraft for his final destination. Joe refuses, believing it is only a dream. Delicately, the archangel man in charge, Mr. Jordan, explains that this place represents the afterlife, but Joe is convinced that his death is a mistake. After verifying Joes status, a clerk announces that Joe isnt due to arrive until the year 2025, and The Escort, a rookie, admits that he pulled him away before the outcome of the collision. Since Joes body has already been cremated, Mr. Jordan says that in order for him to return to life, Joe must occupy the body of another man, as long as that mans death has not yet been discovered. Mr. Jordan and Joe proceed to scout for possible candidates. At the estate of Leo Farnsworth, a millionaire industrialist, they observe the scheming of his wife Julia Farnsworth and Tony Abbott, Farnsworths assistant. Julia and Abbott are having an affair, and they have left Farnsworth to drown in the bathtub after drugging him. Meanwhile, Betty Logan, a schoolteacher, arrives at the mansion to insist on meeting with Farnsworth about his refinery that will force the eviction of families in her hometown of Pagglesham, England. Joe is immediately smitten with Betty and wants to help her. Until they find a more athletic candidate, Mr. Jordan agrees to let Joe inhabit the body of Farnsworth temporarily. In the upstairs bathroom, Joe assumes his new identity, but only sees himself in the mirror. Mr. Jordan assures him that even though Joe can only see himself as the internal person of Joe Pendleton, others will see and hear him as Leo Farnsworth. Dressed in polo attire, Joe listens while Betty objects to the plans of Farnsworths Exo-Grey Industries. Upon seeing her husband alive, Julia screams hysterically, and Abbott quickly drags her away. Betty is confused by Joes lack of concern for his wifes outburst, and is also annoyed when Joe claims that he is not really Leo Farnsworth. Believing that he is taunting her, Betty angrily walks away, but warns him that she will be at the next company board meeting. While Joe studies Farnsworths business, Julia and Abbott wait nervously, unsure if he is plotting revenge for the murder. On the way to the board meeting, Joe invites reporters and Betty to join him. Everyone in the room is dumbfounded when Joe passionately compares Exo-Greys winning position to that of a football team that must protect its lead and do the right thing by not exploiting others. That evening, after Betty visits Farnsworth to compliment him on his courage in front of the board, Joe takes her out to dinner at a drivein restaurant. Inside the limousine, Joe confides that he cannot stop staring at her, and Betty admits that she sees something special in his eyes. As they are saying goodbye, Joe declares his plan to divorce Julia. With a new motivation, Joe tells The Escort that he wants to remain in Farnsworths body and get it into shape for football. That evening, despite rigging a heavy fixture above his bed, Julia and Abbott once again fail to murder Farnsworth. The following day, Max arrives at the estate and listens with skepticism while Joe explains that he wants to try out for the Rams quarterback and pay Max to be his trainer. Max is reluctant to jeopardize his reputation with the Rams by entertaining the whims of a millionaire. After initially seeming like at lunatic, Joe is finally able to persuade Max that he is really Joe Pendleton by playing the saxophone badly, as only Joe could. The estate immediately becomes a football training camp. After working out with the butlers of the mansion, Joe takes the next step by purchasing the Los Angeles Rams. During a locker room meeting, the players grumble when told that the new owner Farnsworth will be the quarterback in a scrimmage game and instructed to not hold back with him. At first, Joe receives no help from his offensive line and is repeatedly sacked. But, after requesting one chance to complete a play, he makes a successful pass and continues to display his skills for the rest of the practice, earning the respect of the players and defying the doubters on the sideline. Sometime later at the estate, Joe and Betty attend a gathering of The Ecology Club on the garden lawn. Watching from her bedroom window with Abbott, Julia still thinks that Farnsworth is plotting against them, and contemplates another murder. After strolling together on the property, Joe asks Betty to marry him. Just as Betty responds with excitement, The Escort interrupts Joe with the news that he must abandon Farnsworths body. Unsure what will happen to him, Joe asks Betty to remember what she saw in his eyes. Before she leaves, he embraces her and says, Theres nothing to be afraid of. Mr. Jordan visits to reiterate that he cannot change what is meant to be and that Joe must leave Farnsworths body, but Joe refuses, intent on playing in the Super Bowl and being with Betty. At that moment, Abbott shoots Joe from the bedroom window, and Joe tumbles into a well. No longer in Farnsworths body, Joe emerges from the well with his saxophone and has no choice but to follow Mr. Jordan back to Heaven. Farnsworths disappearance becomes front-page news, and Krim, the police detective in charge, gathers together the staff along with Max, Betty, Julia, and Abbott for questioning at the estate. Meanwhile, the Super Bowl between the Rams and the Pittsburgh Steelers is underway at the Los Angeles Coliseum, and Max is anxious to be there, so Krim lets him watch the game on television during the proceedings. Concerned for Betty, Joe is present in the room alongside Mr. Jordan. When the Rams quarterback, Tom Jarrett, is seriously hurt and taken off the field on a stretcher, Mr. Jordan transports Joe to the game. Mr. Jordan explains that it is Toms destiny to die at this time. Joe moves toward Toms body and occupies it, springing off the stretcher and onto the field. Watching this sudden recovery on television, Max realizes that it must be Joe. At the same time, the gardener runs into the room with Farnsworths jacket that he found in the well, which prompts Julia to scream that Abbott is the murderer, and he in turn points the finger at her. In overtime, Joe leads the Rams to a Super Bowl victory. During the celebration in the locker room, Mr. Jordan appears before Joe declares that Joe now has a permanent body in Tom Jarrett and he will no longer remember Joe Pendleton, or any of the events that happened, but he will now live out the rest of his life as Tom Jarrett with all of Tom's memories, while Joe's memories of his past life and all about Mr. Jordan and Heaven will be forgotten forever. Later that evening, Joe doesnt recognize the saxophone, and thinks Max has drunk too much champagne when he calls him Joe. Max finally realizes that Joe as he knows him no longer exists. As Joe/Tom exits through a stadium hallway, Betty enters looking for Max. After giving her directions, Joe/Tom wonders if they have met before. Betty says she doesnt know him, but she has a connection to football through her close friend, Leo Farnsworth. When the lights of the hallway are switched off, Joe/Tom assures Betty that theres nothing to be afraid of and guides her out the door. Betty is touched by what he said, recalling her last conversation with Farnsworth. Joe/Tom asks her out for coffee, and when Betty realizes that he is the quarterback, she says yes at once."
tt0077681,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","The film begins somewhere in the rural southwest USA in a desert ghost town. At the town's sole gas station, called Fred's Oasis, an old man named Fred (John Steadman) is seen packing his truck and drinking alcohol, looking very worried. He frequently glances at the arid and barren landscape around him, and makes continual comments about ""them"" and what ""they"" would do to him if they ever found out he was escaping. Suddenly, a ragged and somewhat feral teenage girl turns up. Annoyed, Fred asks the girl at what she is doing there... addressing her as Ruby (Janus Blythe). She offers to trade what she has in her bag for food and the old man refuses. They move into a small cabin to talk and Fred scolds her for what she and ""they"" have done recently. Ruby says that her family ambushed a group of passing tourists at the nearby closed-down airfield because they were hungry and no one passes by their home anymore. She pleads with Fred to take her away with him, but he mocks her and says she could never live with normal people in an urban environment. He demands to know whether ""the pack,"" in particular someone named Jupiter, knows what she is doing. He warns her of the danger she is in if Jupiter knows, and she retorts that her ""Pa"" would do the same to Fred if he knew he was getting away from town. A noise distracts them and Ruby hides.A large stationwagon pulling a large trailer pulls into the filling station. They make up of Carter family on vacation. They make up of 65-year-old Bob Carter (Russ Grieve) a retired policeman and his homemaker wife Ethel (Virginia Vincent). They are driving the family car accompanied by their twin teenage children Bobby (Robert Houston), and Brenda (Susan Lanier), and eldest daughter Lynne (Dee Wallace), along with Lynne's husband Doug (Martin Speer) and their baby daughter Katy (Brenda Marinoff). They stop at Fred's Oasis for fuel and to allow themselves and the family's German Shepherd dogs, Beauty and Beast, to stretch. Bob asks Fred for directions to the nearby interstate for they are on their way to California to visit an old silver mine left behind by the late Bob's father. Fred tells them to be sure and stay on the main road.Later, as the Carter family continue on their way, the road they are traveling on becomes an unpaved dirt road and soon they skid off the road and crash their station wagon (due to what is revealed to be a booby-trap). Bob leaves Bobby a pistol and heads back to Fred's Oasis on foot to get help. Doug heads off in the forward direction hoping to find someone. Ethel, Bobby, Brenda, and Lynne remain behind with the trailer and their car, which upon inspection has a broken axle.When one of the family dogs, Beauty, runs off, Bobby chases after her, only to find the dog dead having been killed and disemboweled by unseen assailants who are spying on the Carter family from the nearby hills and communicating with each other by walkie-talkies. Bobby returns to the trailer, but keeps the information to himself. Doug returns soon after, telling them that the dirt road led to a dead end and that he found numerous abandoned vehicles in a large crater at the end of the desert road. When Bobby tries to use their CB radio to call for help, they recieve strange responses from the other end of the line.As night falls, Bob has arrived back at the gas station, where Fred attacks him then tells him the origin of the hill people. It turns out that Fred's son, Jupiter, and Jupiter's family of deranged cannibals dwell in the barren wilderness through which the Carters are traveling. They are commanded by Papa Jupiter (James Whitworth), the patriarch of the clan. He was born a mongoloid monster and killed his mother, Fred's wife, at childbirth. As a child he was vicious and brutal, killing all the livestock on his father's farm, then eventually murdering his sister. Fred eventually reached a breaking point, attacking his son with a tire iron and leaving him in the wilderness to die. The young Jupiter survived, and began living with a depraved, alcoholic prostitute known as Mama. Together they had three sons, the vicious Mars (Lance Gordon), the bald and hideous thug Pluto (Michael Berryman), and the mentally retarded Mercury (Pete Locke) as well as their abused daughter Ruby. They survive in the desert by stealing from and cannibalizing all who cross their path.Papa Jupiter arrives, beats Fred to death with a crowbar, and takes Bob prisoner. Back at the stranded vehicle, Doug and Lynne are spending the night in the family car while everyone else stays in the large trailer. Bobby gets locked out of the trailer and asks Doug for his set of keys. Bobby does not know that the trailer is locked because Pluto is inside looking through their valuables for food while Ethel and Brenda are asleep in the next room. As Bobby uses the keys to enter the trailer, Papa Jupiter sets Bob ablaze on a stake out in the near distance to create a distraction. Ethel, Lynne, Doug, and Bobby rush to Bob, while Brenda stays in the trailer with the baby. Everyone tries to help extinguish the fire, while Pluto reveals himself in the trailer and attacks Brenda. Mars jumps down from the top of the trailer, goes inside, and rapes Brenda. The rest of the Carters extinguish the fire, but Bob dies shortly after. When Ethel and Lynne return to the trailer Pluto jumps out and runs away. Lynne rushes inside to find Mars taking her baby. She attacks Mars as Ethel steps in and hits him with a broom. Mars pulls out a gun and shoots Ethel in the stomach. Brenda rushes in and throws Lynne a knife, which she uses to stab Mars in the leg until he shoots her in the stomach as well. Pluto returns to abduct the baby for a cannibalistic meal and he flees with Mars. Doug rushes in to find his wife dead and Ethel dies shortly thereafter.Of the extended Carter family, only Brenda, Bobby, Doug and (somewhere) baby Katy remain. Doug sets out to find his baby with the surviving dog Beast's help, while Bobby and Brenda remain behind. Back at the cannibal's lair, Ruby is being made to eat the dead dog Beauty as a punishment for attemping to run away. She is chained outside the cave where the clan lives, and Mama torments her. The men of the clan return to the cave where Mercury is pushed to his death off of a hilltop by the Carters' other dog, Beast. Enraged, Papa Jupiter threatens Ruby and vows to avenge his son's death.At dawn the next day, Papa Jupiter and Pluto hurry back to the trailer, vowing to kill the remainder of the Carter family. Doug, meanwhile, spies on the savages' camp. He sees Ruby knock out her Mama and escape with baby Katy into the hills, being followed by Mars who stayed behind to guard Ruby. Doug catches up with Ruby and the baby.Meanwhile, Pluto and Papa Jupiter are on their way to the trailer to kill the rest of the Carter family. Pluto is attacked and incapacitated by Beast. Papa Jupiter runs to the trailer and avoids a trap set by Brenda and Bobby involving the dead Ethel in a lawnchair outside the trailer. They devise another booby-trap, which blows Papa Jupiter and the trailer up when he tries to break in. Bobby goes to check the burning wreckage and is attacked by the injured and badly burned Papa Jupiter. Brenda attacks him with a hatchet and Bobby shoots him to death, killing him at last.Mars follows Doug and Ruby into the hills. Doug turns to confront his pursuer and a brutal fistfight begins with Doug and Mars punching and wrestling each other on the ground. Ruby snares a large rattlesnake nearby and uses it to bite Mars. Taking advantage of the distraction, Doug wrestles Mars' knife away from him and brutally stabbs Mars to death, thus saving the baby. The film ends with a close up of the distraught Doug, who is still stabbing and kicking the dead body of Mars, as Ruby weeps over her brother's body."

tt0077745,"['Horror', 'SciFi']","On an unidentified planet, a strange lifeform in the shape of gel-like spores drifts up into the atmosphere, where it moves slowly through space, drifting until it reaches Earth. The spores enter the atmosphere and are swept downward, emerging in a rainstorm in San Francisco. On the ground, the spores begin to develop, growing on leaves of earthly plants and taking the shape of small pods with a pink flower in the middle.Elizabeth Driscoll (Brooke Adams) notices one of the pods, taking it back to the home she shares with her boyfriend, Geoffrey (Art Hindle). Unable to find the flowering pod in any of her botany books, she hesitantly identifies her new find as a cross-breeding of two different species, a ""grex.""Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland) is an inspector for the health department who uncovers unsanitary conditions at a French restaurant. As he threatens the owner with indictment over finding rat droppings in the food, the other employees quietly slip out to the parking lot and smash Matthew's windshield with a bottle of wine. Matthew is cold and calculating, refusing to let them see his frustration at finding his car vandalized, but when he gets home he calls Elizabeth. They work together at the health department, and Matthew jokes with her about what happened to him at the restaurant. As Elizabeth goes to bed, she forgets about the weird pod, which has suddenly sprouted roots in the glass of water she keeps it in next to their bed.When Elizabeth wakes the next morning, Geoffrey is already awake and dressed, cleaning up the remains of the glass of water next to the bed, as well as some other, unidentifiable mess (resembling some kind of dust). His behavior is strange, and she follows him downstairs as he takes a plastic garbage bag out to a waiting dump truck. At work, she confides to Matthew that Geoffrey is acting strange. Later that night, Elizabeth tries to talk it over with Geoffrey but he ignores her, instead telling her that he's going out and giving her no explanation. Elizabeth touches him intimately and recoils from his emotionless response. Elizabeth rushes over to Matthew's house and insists that Geoffrey is no longer Geoffrey. On the outside he looks the same, but inside he is different. Matthew hears her out but calms her by cooking a good meal and letting her vent.The next day, Matthew hears a strange story from the owner of the Chinese laundry he patronizes: his wife is not his wife. Later he finds Elizabeth at the health department offices, shaken and obviously distraught. She reveals that she has been following Geoffrey during that day and has seen him having brief meetings with strangers, all of them passing unidentifiable parcels among themselves. She is convinced that there is some sort of conspiracy afoot and that Geoffrey is a part of it. Matthew wants to take her to meet his friend, a renowned psychologist named David Kibner (Leonard Nimoy). Kibner has written a number of popular books, the latest of which has just been published, and Matthew takes Elizabeth to a book signing party at a local bookstore so she can meet Kibner personally. While stopped at a traffic light, a strange man (Kevin McCarthy, the star of the original movie) suddenly falls onto Matthew's car, screaming and pounding at the windows, warning ""They're coming! Something terrible! You're in danger!"" Before they can react, another vehicle comes along and strikes the man dead. Strangely, the crowd of people around him seem to not be affected by what has happened at all, not even the motorcycle policeman who arrives on the scene. (Unnoticed by Matthew and Elizabeth, there are one or two others down the streets and sidewalks running from groups of other people chasing them.)At the book party that evening, Matthew and Elizabeth meet up with Jack Bellicec (Jeff Goldblum), a friend of Matthew's. Matthew tries to phone in a report to the police about the accident, but he meets with strange resistance. Elizabeth becomes entranced by an extremely upset woman who is insisting to Kibner that her husband is an impostor. Kibner calms the woman somewhat before sending her on her way with her husband, but Elizabeth urges the woman to contact her at the health department because she knows what she is trying to say.Finally, Matthew is able to introduce Elizabeth to Kibner, who admits that over the past few days, other people have been coming to him with the same story that Elizabeth is telling. The patients tell him that someone close to them is acting strange and seems like an impostor; the patients seem to get over it quickly and change their story. Kibner suggests that it is a result of the emotional isolation people feel in modern relationships, but even Matthew notices that Kibner doesn't seem to be listening to what Elizabeth is really saying. Matthew takes Elizabeth home and she finds a plant waiting for her; a card indicates it's a gift from Geoffrey.Jack returns to his wife, Nancy (Veronica Cartwright), who runs a mud bath facility. Jack is frustrated over not getting a chance to read his poetry at Kibner's book party, and he goes into the baths to relax. Nancy interacts with a strange patron name Mr. Gianni, who has given her a plant just like the one Geoffrey left for Elizabeth. When Nancy begins closing up for the evening, she notices someone lying under a sheet and thinks it is Jack. Removing the sheet, she is startled to find a strange form underneath. It resembles a man, but lacks distinctive features, and is covered with white tendrils. Jack, who was sleeping nearby, suddenly appears and Nancy strikes him accidentally, giving him a nosebleed, and the shape on the table begins to bleed, too. They call Matthew and urge him to come over to examine the phenomenon, and when he realizes something terribly strange is happening, he remembers Elizabeth. Unable to reach her by phone, Matthew goes over to her house, and while Geoffrey sits listening to headphones, Matthew breaks into the house and retrieves a sleeping Elizabeth from the house. Before taking her from her bed, Matthew is shocked to see a duplicate of her body lying nearby, covered in the same fibers as the body at the baths. Back at the baths, Jack falls asleep again and the body begins to take on his features, until Nancy wakes him up again.Matthew and Elizabeth return to the baths and summon Kibner, but the body has apparently vanished. Likewise, Matthew reports Elizabeth's ""other body"" to the police, but when they return to the house she shares wtih Geoffrey, nobody is able to find a body. Kibner quiets the police and Geoffrey seems unconcerned that his girlfriend refuses to come home and is spending the night with Matthew. Converging at Matthew's house, the small group forms their hypothesis: somehow, people are being duplicated, and these alternate bodies are appearing to take their places. Kibner is skeptical and tries to talk them out of their ideas, but finally leaves; unseen by the others, he gets into a car with two other ""conspirators,"" including Geoffrey.All day, Matthew tries to get others to listen to him about what's going on. He makes phone calls, has meetings, and tries to find anybody who will take him seriously. Similarly, the woman who was so upset at the bookstore turns up at the health department and tells Elizabeth that she's alright now. That night, the Bellicecs stay at Matthew's. Kibner gives Elizabeth a mild sedative to help her sleep, and leaves.The entire group falls asleep except for Nancy. As they sleep, four pods in Matthew's garden release white tendrils that attach to the sleeping people, and they soon burst forth with embryonic life, somehow duplicating their victims. Before the transformation is complete, Nancy revives Matthew. Together they wake the others, and Matthew tries to call for help. The telephone operators already know who he is, addressing him by name. The power goes out, and they see a horde of pod people rushing up the hill to Matthew's house. As the others escape out the back, Matthew leaves the yard, smashing in the head of his own duplicate with a hoe.Near the docks, the group appears to be cornered behind a group of shipping crates, but Jack sacrifices himself, rushing out along the dock and getting the pod people clones to give chase. Nancy runs off after him, and Matthew and Elizabeth are on their own. They attempt to take a taxi out of town, but the sinister looking cab driver (Don Siegel, the director of the original movie) drives them to a police roadblock that is arresting people attempting to leave the city. Matthew and Elizabeth find that they cannot escape San Francisco; the pod people are everywhere, even spreading pods right out in the open as they now apparently outnumber humans.Taking refuge in the dark offices of the health department, they find speed pills in someone's desk and take as much as they can in order to keep themselves awake. However, they are found out by none other than Jack, who has returned with Kibner, both of them pod people. Kibner gives them a sedative. He explains that they will be reborn into a new world without emotions or complications, thanks to the alien life form that has taken root on Earth, but Matthew and Elizabeth manage to overpower both of them, killing Jack and locking Kibner in a freezer.On the way out of the building, they encounter Nancy in a stairwell; she is still human. Nancy reveals that she and Jack were separated, but she has discovered a way to move among the pod people: by refusing to show emotion. The three of them leave the health department right out in the open, but Elizabeth is startled by a bizarre pod hybrid that has mutated into a dog with a human head. An elderly pod lady notices it and makes a high-pitched scream, which seems to be a way by the pod people to call out to others of a human in their mist. Nancy once again gets separated from Elizabeth and Matthew, who are identified as human (Type-H as referred by the pod people) and chased throughout the city.Making their way to the docks, Matthew and Elizabeth discover a a greenhouse where thousands of pods are being cultivated. Elizabeth, hindered by a twisted ankle and lack of sleep, feels as if she can't go on much further without sleep. Matthew goes to investigate the sounds of ""Amazing Grace"" coming from one of the ships, leaving Elizabeth hidden among some tall grass. Matthew is horrified to see huge palettes of pods being loaded onto the ships; the spiritual is simply a random radio broadcast, as the station is changed, the ship helmed by pod people ready to take the alien presence to other areas of the world.When Matthew returns to Elizabeth, he finds her asleep, and he is unable to wake her. As he holds her in his arms, Elizabeth's body crumbles into a husk, and her nude clone appears in the grass. The pod Elizabeth tells Matthew that everything is alright; the conversion is painless, and good. She encourages him to sleep, but her voice is hard and cold. Matthew runs, slipping into the greenhouse facility. He makes his way to the steep scaffolding and after taking a fire axe, beings wreaking havoc among the pods, dropping electrical lighting rigs onto them until the entire place is in flames and the unborn pods are burned. But the fire alarm is sounded, and the pod people pursue him, including the newly converted Elizabeth. Matthew slips away from them, hiding under a dock. He hears them talking amongst themselves and one of them says: ""He can't get far, he has to sleep sometime."" Matthew knows that they are right.The next day, Matthew goes through the motions of his job, staring blankly at his co-workers. He sees Elizabeth in the hallways of the building but they do not acknowledge one another. Outside, Matthew sees schoolbuses of children from Santa Barbara, L.A. and other areas of California being taken to a theater for their conversion. A while later, Matthew is walking along a deserted street towards the City Hall building and hears a voice calling to him. Turning around, he sees the still-human Nancy across the street. As she crosses the street to meet him, Matthew's face twists into a grimace and he points at her, screaming an alien scream to alert the other pod clones to her presence. Nancy screams realizing, too late, that Matthew is now a pod person as the camera zooms into his mouth and the screen fades to black...(By the time the end credits finish rolling, it is strongly implied that Nancy will be captured and become a pod clone too. Apparently there are no more humans alive in San Francisco. The inevitable has happened: the pods have won... and the rest of Earth is apparently doomed.)"

Gazzo) and demands the marriage of Spiro's daughter, Rose (Susan Sarnadon), to his son, Groffo (Judd Hirsch), a union for which Zharko paid $4,500. Spiro explains that Rose refuses the marriage because she does not like Groffo, but offers to refund half of the bride price to compensate Zharko for the inconvenience. Zharko finds the offer unacceptable, so the two men take the matter to the gypsy elders. When the elders rule in favor of Spiro, Zharko agrees to leave, but on the way out of the camp, he grabs Rose and drives away with her. Later, Rose is pleased when she gives birth to Groffo's son, David, since he will one day be king of the gypsies.As a boy, Dave (Corey Einbinder) helps his family with various confidence games to earn money as they roam from state to state, but by the time they settle in New York City and his sister Tita (Brooke Shields) is born, he knows he does not want to live as a gypsy. As alcoholic Groffo physically abuses Dave, Rose and Tita, Dave's resentment against his father grows. When Zharko praises the 12-year-old Dave for his intelligence and offers to arrange a marriage with a gypsy girl named Persa, the boy runs away.Skipping forward several years later an adult, Dave (Eric Roberts) continues to commit acts of fraud and petty larceny until his grandfather approaches him. Believing Groffo is unfit to become king, Zharko offers his ring and medallion, the symbols of the kingship, to Dave. Recoiling, Dave explains he doesn't want to lead the gypsies; he wants to live the ""normal"" life everyone else has. Zharko says that he is dying, so the gypsies will soon need a new leader and he is counting on Dave to assume power. Agreeing to go back to the gypsies, Dave returns to his parents' home to warn his father against beating Rose and Tita. Groffo berates Dave for renouncing the family's ways in order to act like the despised ""gadjos"", or non-gypsies. When Dave rejects Groffo as his father, the two men fight until Groffo pulls a gun and Dave escapes out of the apartment window.Some time later, Dave is working as a singing waiter and dates a gadjo, named Sharon (Annette O'Toole), with whom he has dreams of moving to California. The two head back to his apartment one night to find Rose and Tita waiting for him. Explaining that Groffo has accepted $6,000 to wed Tita to a boy she doesn't like, Rose asks Dave for the money to repay the bride price to get his sister out of the arranged marriage. Dave refuses. While leaving, Rose informs Dave that Zharko is dying in the hospital and asking for him.The next day, Dave goes to the hospital and runs into Persa (Annie Potts), who invites him back to her apartment so Rose can have a private conversation with him. Dave proceeds to his grandfather's bedside where Zharko bestows him with the king's ring and medallion before passing away. Dave announces that he has been made king to Groffo, who is so hurt and betrayed that he refuses to take them.That night, Dave visits Persa to talk to his mother and Rose informs him that Groffo will wed Tita to her groom right after Zharko's funeral. Rose proclaims that Dave is the king whether he wants the role or not and he is shirking his duties by refusing to help his family avoid the unwanted marriage. Dave refuses to accept the responsibility and leaves. On the way home, two thugs chase and attack Dave, but he escapes them and returns home to find Sharon cooking dinner. Dave explains that Groffo hired the two men to kill him and reassures her that they can still go to California after he handles family business. After escorting Sharon out, Dave returns to Persa, who comforts him, and the two make love.Later, at Zharko's funeral, Dave notices Tita in a wedding dress and informs Groffo of his plan to reimburse the young groom's parents so his sister will not have to marry. Groffo is enraged when Dave suggests that his father explain to the parents that the wedding cancellation is not Groffo's choice, but rather the king's decision. When Dave starts to leave with Tita, Groffo tries to stop him until Dave pulls a gun. Dave steals a car and drives away with his sister, promising to take her to California, but Groffo gives chase until both cars crash. Groffo flees the scene as Dave realizes Tita is dead.Later, Dave goes to his parents' home with a shotgun. He chases Groffo throughout the apartment building before blasting his father out of a window, killing him at last. When the police arrive, Rose tells them an unknown gunman broke in and shot her husband.At Groffo's funeral, Dave marvels at how many people showed up to pay their respects, even though his father was a terrible person. At the end of the service, Dave walks out of the cemetery with all the gypsies trailing behind him, noting that he never wanted the position of king, but perhaps he can lead the gypsies into the twentieth century."
tt0077869,"['Animation', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy']","Early in the Second Age of Middle-earth, elven smiths forged nine Rings of Power for mortal men, seven for the Dwarf-Lords, and three for the Elf-Kings. At the same time, the Dark Lord Sauron made the One Ring to rule them all after learning the secrets of how to forge them from the Elves of Hollin--a deviation from Tolkien's work in which Sauron taught ring lore to the Elves and forged all the rings except the three Elvish rings. As the Last Alliance of Elves and Men fell, the Ring fell into the hands of Prince Isildur from across the sea, and after Isildur was killed by orcs, the Ring lay at the bottom of the river Anduin. Over time, Sauron captured the nine Rings made for men and turned their owners into the Ringwraiths, terrible beings who roamed the world searching for the One Ring. The Ring was found by a Stoor named Déagol, whose friend, Sméagol, murdered him and stole it for himself. The Ring warped Sméagol into a twisted, gurgling wretch known only as Gollum (Peter Woodthorpe), and he wandered with it to a cave in the Misty Mountains. Hundreds of years later, the hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Norman Bird) accidentally discovered his ""precious"" Ring and took it back with him to the Shire.
Years later, during Bilbo's birthday celebrations in the Shire, the wizard Gandalf (William Squire) tells him to leave the Ring for Frodo Baggins (Christopher Guard). Bilbo agrees, and leaves the Shire. Seventeen years pass, during which Gandalf learns that the Shire is in danger: evil forces have discovered that the Ring is in the possession of a Baggins. Gandalf meets with Frodo to explain the Ring's history and the danger it poses to all of Middle-earth. Frodo leaves his home, taking the Ring with him.
He is accompanied by three hobbit friends, Pippin (Dominic Guard), Merry (Simon Chandler), and Sam (Michael Scholes). After a narrow escape from the Ringwraiths pursuing them, the hobbits eventually come to Bree, where they meet Aragorn (John Hurt), who is first introduced to them as Strider, a friend of Gandalf's, who leads them the rest of the way to Rivendell. Frodo is stabbed atop Weathertop mountain by the chief of the Ringwraiths with a knife imbued with evil magic. Part of the knife stays inside him, and he gets sicker as the journey progresses. The Ringwraiths catch up with them shortly after they meet the elf Legolas (Anthony Daniels), and at a standoff at the ford of Rivendell, the Ringwraiths are swept away by the enchanted river. At Rivendell, Frodo is healed by its lord, Elrond. He meets Gandalf again, held captive by his fellow wizard Saruman (Fraser Kerr), who plans to join with Sauron but also wants the Ring for himself. Bilbo, Gandalf, and the others argue about what should be done with the One Ring, and Frodo volunteers to go to Mordor, where the Ring can be destroyed. Frodo sets off from Rivendell with eight companions: Gandalf; Aragorn; Boromir, son of the Steward of Gondor (Michael Graham Cox); Legolas; Gimli the dwarf (David Buck); and Frodo's original three hobbit companions.
Their attempt to cross the Misty Mountains is foiled by heavy snow, and they are forced to take a path under the mountains via Moria. Moria was an ancient dwarf kingdom, but is now full of orcs and other evil creatures, and Gandalf falls into an abyss while battling a balrog. The remaining eight members of the Fellowship continue through the elf-haven Lothlórien, but Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo. Frodo decides to leave the others behind and continue his quest alone, although faithful Sam insists on accompanying him.
Boromir is killed by orcs while trying to defend Merry and Pippin. They are captured by the orcs, who intend to take them to Isengard through the land of Rohan. The hobbits escape and flee into Fangorn forest, where they meet Treebeard (John Westbrook), a huge tree-like creature. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas find Merry and Pippin; they find small footprints and follow them into Fangorn Forest. There, they find Gandalf, whom they believed had died in the mines of Moria. The four ride to Rohan's capital, Edoras, where Gandalf persuades King Théoden (Philip Stone) that his people are in danger. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas then travel to the defensive fortification Helm's Deep.
Frodo and Sam, meanwhile, discover Gollum stalking them, and capture him. Frodo pities him, and lets him live in return for guidance to Mount Doom. Gollum promises to lead them to a secret entrance to Mordor. At Helm's Deep, Théoden's forces struggle to resist an onslaught of orcs sent by Saruman. Gandalf arrives the next morning with the Riders of Rohan just in time, destroying the orc army."

André), he is told he needs some kind of hook or gimmick to connect with the audience. When he adds ventriloquism to his act, using a dummy named Fats, his career takes off.Over time, he plays bigger theaters and appears on talk shows, and then his manager Ben Greene (Burgess Meredith) brings him an offer for the big time, on television. The only problem: a medical examination is required. Corky absolutely refuses, stating it's a matter of principle... but as the conversation continues, he becomes almost hysterical at the prospect.He packs up and returns to his old hometown to rethink his career. He gets a cabin at a lakeside resort run by his high school crush Peg (Ann-Margret). It's obvious she returns his feelings, but she is married to an overbearing but dedicated husband Duke (Ed Lauter) who is a bit jealous and possessive.As Corky is trying to rekindle their relationship, his private conversations with his alter ego dummy, known as ""Fats,"" take on a sinister and self-abusive quality. Fats goes from an amusing character played through his mannequin, into a schizoid-like personality split, in which Corky no longer can discern that Fats is a feature of his subconscious self.His manager Ben comes out to the resort to find Corky. He sees that Corky is losing it, and challenges Corky to, ""...make Fats shut up for five minutes..."" which is played out in real time. It's frightening, because Corky is clearly insane, and he admits this, twitching and shifting uncomfortably in his seat, when he says, ""I'm not going to make it...""Fats determines that Ben has to die in order to preserve their secret, so Corky kills him and drops the body in the lake.

At the end of the movie, Peg agrees to run away with Corky, but wants to wait until Duke returns to tell him face to face rather than just leaving. Corky, who has pledged to pack up Fats for good when he leaves with Peg, becomes desperate since he knows Duke is never coming back.Fats tells Corky he has to kill Peg as well, and a tormented Corky goes to the main house to do his bidding. When he returns to the cabin, Fats starts to feel unwell, and Corky reveals that he has stabbed himself rather than hurt the only person he loves.

tt0077914,"['Drama', 'Horror']","Martin (John Amplas), a young man who looks around 20-years-old, boards a train in Indianapolis, Indiana for New York. At night, he breaks into a sleeping car and sedates a woman with a syringe full of narcotics. She struggles, but he tells her not to struggle or be upset because she won't feel pain. After a few minutes, the woman falls asleep, and Martin has sex with the unconscious woman. Afterwards, he slices her wrists with a razor blade so he can drink her blood. The woman bleeds to death in her sleep.In the morning, the train stops in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where Martin disembarks. He is met by Tata Cuda (Lincoln Maazel) an elderly and hostile old man wearing a white suit who claims to be his cousin from the Old World. Together, they travel by another train to the town of Braddock, a dying industrial suburb. They walk to Cuda's large house where he shows Martin his living quarters. Cuda then accuses Martin of being an 84-year-old vampire from his old country. He has taken in Martin because he is family since Martin's parents are said to have recently died, but tells him, ""First I will save your soul. Then I will destroy you."" Cuda tells Martin that he is free to come and go as he pleases, but he also threatens to destroy Martin without salvation if he kills a single person from the neighborhood, also adding his granddaughter, Christina (Christine Forrest) lives with him.Martin chases Cuda to his own room, busts open the door, forcing Cuda to grab a crucifix from his dresser drawer and defend himself with it, whispering ""Nosferatu"". Martin denies being a vampire and states that he is merely Cuda's cousin. Martin then grabs a string of garlic on Cuda's door, bites it and grabs the small, white crucifix Tata Cuda aims at him. Martin holds the cross gingerly to his face, saying bitterly, ""It isn't magic... even I know that. It isn't magic"".That evening, Cuda introduces Christina to Martin, but also warns her to stay away from him. But Christina instead strikes up a friendship with Martin who confides in her about his vampire heritage. When Cuda later confirms Martin's claims to be a vampire, Christina, not surprisingly, refuses to believe either one. She thinks that Cuda and the other members of her family have driven Martin to insanity by making him think that he is a vampire. (It is never revealed if Martin really is a vampire, or just a shy and lonely youth with troubled issues.)Christina is the only person that Martin gets the courage to talk to. When Christina's boyfriend Arthur (Tom Savini) arrives at the house for dinner, Martin stops talking and backs away despite Arthur's casual attempt at a conversation. Christina later confides in Martin that she hopes to leave Braddock someday with Arthur, even though Martin points out that Arthur treats her badly and is both verbally and physically abusive towards her.When Christina sees that Martin won't talk to anyone else, she buys him a phone which he installs in his room. Martin begins to repeatedly call a radio talk show where he describes what it's like to be a vampire. He becomes known on the radio as ""the Count"" to all the listeners. But the patronizing host (voice of cameraman Michael Gornick) thinks he's just crazy.Martin gets a job at Cuda's grocery store, stocking shelves, hauling boxes around, and even gets to be a delivery boy for some of the customers. One of his customers is a certain Abby Santini (Elyane Nadeau), who becomes taken with Martin. She is a very friendly young woman who is depressed who tells Martin that her husband is unfaithful. But Martin still does not have the nerve to talk with her. Nonetheless, she is happy to have someone to confide in with her life problems. Martin phones the radio show host to describe his infatuation with the housewife and senses that she wants to have sex with him. When the radio show host asks Martin if it is a sexual problem that he has involving women criticizing him during sex, Martin replies that he has never had sex with a woman who was awake.One day, Martin travels by train outside of Braddock to look for victims. At a supermarket, he follows a young woman (Sarah Venable) home to her posh suburban house. He sees the woman's husband, Mr. Willard, (producer Richard Rubenstein) leave for a long business trip, and Martin decides this would be the right time for more feeding. Martin returns to the house after dark and programs a walkie-talkie to open the garage door on an open frequency.Throughout the sequence, Martin begins 'remembering' the distant past, in black-and-white: possibly he was a vampire on the hunt, killing a young romantic victim, then chased by an angry horde armed with torches and pitchforks, or he has seen one monster movie too many. Open ended.Back in the present, Martin is in the house intending to surprise and attack the housewife whom he believes her to be alone. But it's Martin who gets the surprise when he bursts into the bedroom to find the housewife in bed with her adulterous lover Lewis (porn star Al Levitsky). After a vicious struggle, Martin jabs both of them with hypodermic needles full of narcotics, and waits for the drugs to take affect. He drags the unconscious body of Lewis from the house to a small forest on the other side of a low fence, and down a hill, where he kills him by shoving a broken tree branch into his neck, and drinks his blood. Martin returns to the house where he has sex with the unconscious woman. But out of compassion and pity, he decides to let her live. He then removes any evidence of his presence with practiced, methodical precision.After one Sunday at church, attended by, among other people, Abby Santini and her philandering husband, Cuda brings home Father Howard (director George A. Romero) who asks him about the possibility of exorcism and demon possession. Father Howard calls upon the elderly Father Zulemas (Clifford Forrest, Jr.) over at Cuda's request. Together, Cuda and Zulemas confront Martin his bedroom and attempt to perform an exorcism on him. At this point, Martin remembers (another real or imaginary flashback), in the Old Country, people trying to perform an exorcism on him, and fleeing. Martin then flees from Cuda and Zuelmas as well.A little later that night, Martin terrorizes Cuda in a children's playground when he puts on a Dracula cape and puts false fangs into his mouth to pretend that he really is a vampire, thus humiliating the old man who takes on Martin in single combat, holding his crucifix while Martin playfully japes him. Then Cuda attempts to conquer him with his walking cane, whereupon Martin spits out his falsies, wipes makeup from his face, holding it out for Cuda to see, and states, 'It's just a costume... It's only a costume,"" then drifts away into the night mist.One day, Martin finally musters the courage to talk with Abby during a routine delivery to her house where he tells her that he's aware of her attempts to seduce him and wants now to have sex with her. After having consensual sex for the first time, Martin learns that a tearful Abby is extremely depressed because her husband just left her after she discovered that she cannot bear children, and that her desires towards Martin are based on sex and nothing else. But Martin wants to stay with her and help her move on with her life. Martin tells the radio show host about his affair with the housewife and that he no longer has the urge to attack other women.Meanwhile, Arthur meets with Cuda in a bar and tells him that he wants Christina to leave town with him to New York City so they can get married and start a family. Martin later meets Christina on the front porch, where she's put out about Arthur apparently forgetting they were going out that night. Martin finally voices his dislike of Arthur, stating, ""I don't like Arthur, he makes you feel bad,"" after which Christina complains about her current life and goes back inside. But Christina becomes angry at Cuda when she learns that he told Arthur that insanity runs in their family and he shouldn't consider having children with her. After confronting her grandfather, he slaps her for blaspheming, twice.Shortly afterwards, Christina packs up and leaves Braddock with Arthur, despite Martin telling her that Arthur is abusive towards her. But her mind is made up. Before leaving, Christina tells Martin that she really has no ill feelings towards him and just wants to make a fresh start with her life. She says goodbye to him and promises to write. But Martin knows that with an abusive and possessive man in Christina's life, she probably won't (Martin turns out of be rightfully so; Christina never calls or writes ever again). With no one to cook for him now, Tata Cuda has to do it for himself and Martin, which is only the tip of a slowly melting iceberg, including Martin now stalking a verbally-abusive Mrs. Bellini, a local neighbor and regular grocery store customer, with an eye toward making her pay for her insolence.Depressed over losing his one true friend, Martin phones the radio show host and tells him that he's getting ""shaky"" and wants to go out looking for more victims. That night, Martin travels to a rough crime-ridden area of Pittsburgh and attacks two derelicts (Tony Pantanella and Regis Survinski) in a junk and grime-filled storage building. He kills both of them by beating them viciously with a steel pipe, then slitting one bum's wrist and drinking his blood. Martin runs and breaks into a second-hand store full of items to change his blood-splattered clothing. Just then, a police car shows up and two cops get out. Martin narrowly escapes during a long chase on foot which leads from the store, through the garbage-strewn streets and into an old warehouse where a drug deal is going down. A shootout between the two cops and three thugs ends where all of them are killed, leaving Martin as the sole survivor who hurriedly runs away from the carnage.The next day, after shopping for poultry with Cuda, Martin finds Abby Santini dead in her bathtub, after she has slit her writs with a razor blade and swallowed booze. After calling the police to report the dead body, he phones the radio show host later that afternoon to say that he didn't kill her and really doesn't need friends or people to talk to for he is his own person.After joining a town parade with a marching band, Shriners-types, and other kids, Martin calls the DJ one final time, believing his life all about to get better. But Cuda has heard about Abby's suicide, mistakenly thinking Martin killed her and made it look like a suicide as he's done before. The next morning, Cuda walks into Martin's room while he is asleep and kills him by hammering a wooden stake through Martin's heart.Cuda buries Martin's body in his back garden, while over the closing credits various voices from people are heard talking to the radio show host asking the whereabouts of ""the Count""."
tt0077921,"['Horror', 'SciFi']","Chaos and destruction are all around as crews continue the clean up from an airliner crash city center last night. Tonight, we find ourselves in writer John Morlar's (Richard Burton) apartment, as he intently watches TV coverage of a NASA space mission going awry. As his intense eyes stare at the impending doom for the astronauts, his chair is suddenly spun around and his head is repeatedly and brutally beaten by an attacker from behind camera. Just prior to the beating, Morlar's eyes look right into the attacker's and he calmly says ""a response at last"".An investigation into the beating death has the detectives shocked to find that Morlar has survived barely, and they rush him to the hospital. He has his head totally bandaged (except for eyes and nose) and is plugged into multiple machines and monitors, hoses, tubes, etc. Obviously he is in the ICU, and here he stays for the rest of the movie.We follow the detectives' investigation into the beating at Morlar's apartment; how he lives, gets along with neighbors, his traits; his artwork, furnishings, his writings, etc. His writings are cryptic, obscure, dark and ominous, dealing with many past catastrophies and disasters. The detectives find that Morlar had been seeing a psychologist.They find the psychologist, Dr. Zonfeld (Lee Remmick) and try to discover what's up with Morlar. They find that he felt like he had some kind of power to create catastrophe. Zonfeld doesn't give much to the detectives other than to state he was delusional, so they go back to the apartment and hospital to dig up some more info.Morlar's hand trembles and he's given a pencil...he writes a warning about the old cathedral wall, which had been cracking lately, causing much worry about a collapse. Detectives think there is more to learn from Zonfeld.From this next visit to Zonfeld, the story is told through flashbacks from Zonfeld's and Morlar's points of view while she was interviewing, analyzing Morlar. She reveals that he felt he had caused the deaths of many people that had wronged him in the past. His nanny, his parents, his school professor, his estranged wife and her boyfriend. He felt that he learned that he could cause almost any type of catastrophe. She still claimed to the detectives that she felt it was all in his head, a delusion. She seems disinterested in his case and makes the police feel that there was no worry from her about the validity of his claims.Morlar's almost flatline brain activity ocasiionally gets a blip or two when his hand wants to warn of the collapse of the wall, so the detectives really watch him close. A bit more pressure on Zonfeld, and she accompanies the police to the hospital. Seing Morlar causes her to confess that Morlar's claims had begun to seem possible, and he had actually gotten her to come to his apartment. She witnessed him stare at the airliner as it took off, and watched it fly straight into the city center as he stared it to it's death.The detective believes now that Zonfeld has more to do with this, and goes back to her place the next day, to find her dead, from a self-induced injection. She left a taped confession that she had tried to kill him, to prevent the space disaster, but had failed. She has now convinced the detective that Morlar could cause these disasters.As police watch morlar in the hospital, the cathedral wall begins to crumble just as the Queen is arriving for a visit. Police rush all around trying to prevent death and destruction, but only our detective knows what is the cause. He rushes back to the hospital to remove the life support from Morlar. As Morlar's little jiggles and wiggles on the brain monitor fade, the falling cathedral catastrophe wanes and we sigh relief that it has all ended.The police look at Morlar's flatlined body, and are about to leave when the EEG monitor begins to make creepy squeaky sounds, and the flatline becomes very active. Then we look at Morlar's bandaged face, as his intense eyes open wide."
tt0077928,"['Biography', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","This movie is based loosely on Billy Hayes' book Midnight Express about his five year experience in the Turkish prison system. The movie was exaggerated for dramatic effect.October 6, 1970. Opening scene has a xenophobic soundtrack of machine guns, Muslim prayer cries, and synthesizer music and a glimpse of Istanbul, Turkey during twilight with shots of the Bosphorus Strait, a mosque, and the downtown area with seagulls flying about . It is portrayed as a very spooky, forbidding place.While finishing up on his vacation in Istanbul, Turkey, American college student Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) is in his hotel room and straps several pounds of hashish (about two kilograms) to his body. The film's soundtrack consists of an increasing heartbeat.Billy is at the airport, nervous at being caught smuggling, goes to the washroom to wet his face and attempt to relax himself, and makes his way with his girlfriend, Susan (Irene Miracle), through customs. Billy perspires heavily, noticed by the middle aged, chain-smoking customs agent who checks his bag. After his bags are searched, both Billy and Susan board a shuttle bus to their plane. Billy smiles and is relieved thinking he is out of danger. However, as the bus pulls up to the plane, he notices that a large detachment of armed police and soldiers have taken up positions just outside the plane. Unable to detach and discard the hashish, and sweating heavily, Billy is arrested on the spot when he is frisked by a young Turkish policeman and his comrades, who immediately point their guns at Billy, thinking he may be dangerous. Billy is taken away and back to security and searched, his bags being thoroughly searched and all items such as cigarettes, camera film, and toothpaste are searched and destroyed. He is forced to stand around in his underwear. Afterward, the Turkish security chief of the airport makes Billy stand for several press photographs of him holding the confiscated drugs with the smiling customs officers and then slaps them around after Billy reveals more hash in his boots they didn't find.A little later, Billy is forced to stand naked with the customs officers staring and grinning at him and an unidentified southern American man (Bo Hopkins), presumably an agent with the DEA, walks in. He is calm and kind with Billy and takes him to a local police station where he is is interrogated where Tex translates for a local Turkish detective whom offers Billy freedom if he points out who sold him the hash.He takes Billy downtown the next morning to the bazaar where he claims to have purchased the hashish and tells Billy that recent terrorist airline hijackings have made the Turks much more fanatical about airport security and that the potency or type of drug that Billy was caught with doesn't matter: the Turkish government wants to appear tough on smuggling. Billy is at the restaurant that seems to be a popular place with young American hippies where the sale happened and tries to run from his security escort. He is quickly caught by Tex himself, whose previously friendly attitude suddenly changes for the worse as he his holding a gun to his head.During his first night in holding, Billy has his hair cut short and is put into a filthy cell by a trustee, Rifki, (Paolo Bonacelli) whom refuses to give him a blanket for warmth because he's not selling any at the time, then sneaks out of his tiny cell and takes a blanket in storage. He is later rousted out of his cell by the trustee and taken to a large guard named Hamidou (Paul L. Smith), the chief of guards, who takes him to another filthy room, the basement, trusses Billy's ankles in the air and hits the soles of his feet repeatedly with his club for stealing the blanket. Billy's feet swell immensely and he is left in horrific pain.The next morning, a small group of prisoners, Jimmy (Randy Quaid), a towering and hot-tempered American, and Erich, a kindly Swede, get him on his feet and walking (they tell him his feet will continue to swell and his recovery will be longer if he doesn't move around). Jimmy was sentenced for attempting to rob a mosque and Erich was busted for smuggling about 100 grams of hash and given a 12-year sentence. Jimmy is quite sure Billy will receive a stiff sentence, but Erich remains optimistic that he just needs a good lawyer. Jimmy shows Billy around how to navigate the minefield of the prison and, being a foreigner, not to trust any of the Turks, especially the children there who rat out prisoners to Hamidou. The prison resembles an old barracks from the 1800's.Billy is introduced to Max (John Hurt), is a bespectacled, introverted, unkempt, 30-something junkie uninterested in small talk that injects himself with ""gastro"" a stomach medicine with codeine. Max has been in prison the longest for drug dealing (seven years and counting), while Erich has already served four years and Jimmy around three. Billy and Erich are conversing with him to get a lawyer and Max is in a haze telling Billy about the Turkish justice system and that all Turkish lawyers are crooked and that he just needs to escape the best way he knows how, catching the ""Midnight Express"", a train that doesn't stop at the prison. He refers to him a lawyer named Yesil that got off a Frenchman for smuggling 200 kilos.A few weeks later, Billy's father (Mike Kellin) arrives and embraces him, forgiving his mistake and introduces him to Stanley Daniels (Michael Ensign) of the American Consulate and his requested lawyer Yesil to defend him. Yesil is a fat, shifty, greasy-haired, chain-smoking, ever-smiling man with gold teeth that promises Billy to get him the right court and judge and not to worry. Their goal is to get bail for Billy and a fake passport to get him across to Greece to leave.Billy appears before a local Turkish court before a panel of three judges to hear his case and defend him. But Billy's shifty and uninterested lawyer does little to combat the charges brought by an angry prosecutor, who wants Billy charged with more than possession: If Billy is charged with smuggling over mere possession, his sentence will be heavier. After the three judges deliberate for an uncertain amount of time, Billy is sentenced to serve a prison term of four years and two months for possession of hashish at the Sagmalcilar Prison. Billy and his father appear devastated while his defense lawyer argues that it is a good thing because the judges (sympathetic to Billy) turned down the prosecutor's request to convict Billy for smuggling or impose a life sentence in order to make an example of him. Billy's father gives him a care package of snacks, cigarettes, writing paper, toiletries, and loses his temper that he's unable to get him out of prison. He warns Billy not to do anything stupid and that they can play with his sentence. They tearfully depart.Over the next several months, Billy slowly adjusts to prison life. Jimmy gets stabbed in the behind for treating a Turkish prisoner badly and Hamidou beats several of the young boys on their soles believing to have raped a new young inmate, with his two pudgy sons looking on and him warning them about what happens if they break the law. He is also given the truth about Rifki, the trustee, who informs on other prisoners for unheard-of privileges and favors and has a special distaste for foreigners. Rifki also sells watery tea, low-grade hashish, steals from his fellow inmates, and seems to have an unlimited (for incarceration) supply of money to bribe the poorly paid guards. When Max offends Rifki, the informant kills Max's pet cat.In June of 1972, Billy meets with his lawyer Yesil again with Yesil assuring him of convincing Turkish officials to lose his records before the high court in Ankara can review his case for the right amount of money. Billy is bored and uninterested at Yesil's visit, feeling it's all empty promises.Jimmy shows Billy and Max blueprints to the prison of catacombs. They believe they can access them through a wall in the kitchen and go underneath or simply climbing over the wall. Max dismisses Jimmy's idea as foolish and Billy does not want to risk trying to escape fearing that if he's caught it will add time to his sentence. An angry Jimmy decides to go ahead with it himself, being caught and badly beaten with a leather strap by Hamidou and sent to the sanitarium.In June of 1974, Billy's friend, Erich, is granted transfer to prison in his home country, more than likely leaving there after a short term because of Sweden's lenient laws, and leaves the prison after serving around eight years. Billy farewells with him and marks down his prison time to 53 days.After almost four years in the prison, Billy is informed that his case will be reviewed again. Thinking he's being let go early for good behavior, Billy rushes to meet with Stanley Daniels, the representative from the US ambassador's office in the Turkish capital city of Ankara. However, Daniels has bad news; the High Court in the Turkish capital of Ankara has heard a different argument from the prosecutor who has appealed the four-year term verdict, and is seeking to charge Billy with smuggling hashish and make an example of him. Since double-jeopardy law does not exist in Turkey like it does in the US, any accused can be tried more then once for the same crime on appeal or should new evidence surface.At another courtroom hearing, a distraught Billy rails against the three judges, the prosecutor, his own lawyer, the Turkish legal system, and the nation of Turkey itself. Speaking through a translator, with a mixture of anger and pity in his voice, the chief judge tells Billy that his hands are tied by Ankara and has no choice but to give him a life sentence. Billy is given a minimum sentence of 30 years, with time already served, for smuggling of hashish.A saddened Billy sits in his cell with a sense of hopelessness that night, but now wants to go forward with Jimmy's original plan of escape. The stones used as walls in their section's kitchen are cemented in place with mortar that has weakened greatly in the dank conditions. Jimmy, Billy and Max discover two such stones and are able to remove them, finding a shaft behind them that leads to a system of flooded catacombs under the prison. The three of them spend two nights and hours searching for an escape route. However, once they do go underneath, it turns out the Turks have long since blocked off every tunnel. The three give up and replace the stones.Rifki finds their secret in the kitchen the next morning after their unsuccessful escape attempt and immediately tells Hamidou. Hamidou suspects Jimmy of being responsible after what happened the first time and drags him off for punishment again, and is never seen from then on.Billy and Max figure out a revenge scheme: they find Rifki's stash of hidden money and destroy it by burning part and boiling the other part. In retaliation, a raid is performed by Hamidou and Rifki plays a charade with Hamidou and frames Max for hashish possession. Hamidou has Max dragged off for punishment like Jimmy was. Billy loses it after all he's been through and savagely attacks Rifki in the washroom, chasing and beating the traitor until he bites out the man's tongue out. Billy is taken away by guards, beaten, and sent to the prison's insane asylum.In October 1975, Billy has now been reduced to a catatonic and unkempt shadow of his former self in the prison's ward for the insane where he wanders in a daze among the other disturbed and catatonic prisoners, many of which look mentally incapacitated. His activities seem to consist solely of walking in a circle around a pillar with other prisoners. Max is running from guards for an unknown infraction and is grabbed by Hamidou and thrown across the place and severely injured. One day a prisoner, named Ahmet, a convicted child rapist and college-educated philosopher tries to talk to him about ""bad machines"" to no avail.A group of men are doing their morning Muslim prayers and the guards hit the inmates with their sticks waking them up out of bed. Billy is hit, howls out of sleep, and horrified, making it evident he is suffering badly from PTSD.After 5 years, Billy is visited by Susan, who tells him that US senators are trying to work on his case to get him out, pleads with him to put himself together and get out of there unless he wants to die, and passes him a photo album of his family and tells him it has a picture of his ""good friend, Mr. Franklin, from the bank"". Susan, feeling devastated at Billy's horribly bedraggled state, also opens her blouse so Billy can masturbate. A guard takes him away, leaving Susan even more devastated.The next morning, Billy is walking the pillar in the opposite direction, which is forbidden in the Muslim code. Ahmet meets him telling him it's wrong that a good Muslim always walks right. His words seem restore some of Billy's sanity and Billy tells him that he himself is the man that makes the machines. Ahmet walks away horrified.Billy goes into the filthy sanatorium washroom and inspects the album closely, finding numerous $100 bills hidden inside the cover lining totaling around $2,000 in cash. He passes by an almost dead Max to hold on and stay alive that he's leaving and will come back for him. Max wakes up and is somewhat conscious.Billy sees Hamidou taking a restraining belt off a now dead inmate and about to leave. He approaches Hamidou with part of the money and tries to bribe his longtime enemy to take him to the sanitarium that Jimmy had spoken about where the guards are more lax in their duties. Hamidou accepts Billy's bribe but drags Billy past the entrance to the sanitarium, to a large dressing room filled with guard uniforms and with pegs set into the walls. Hamidou beats Billy, yells about how he's fed up with him, and attempts to rape him when Billy suddenly rushes Hamidou and pushes him forcefully backwards. Hamidou, flailing and trying to regain his footing, slams into the wall, driving a clothes peg into the back of his head, dying instantly. For a short time, Billy considers shooting the dead man with his sidearm but decides not to.Billy dresses himself in a guard's uniform and reclaiming his money, walks through the prison unnoticed to the front door. As he walks down the stairs, another guard stops him and throws him the keys to the door telling him (in Turkish) to remember to lock up when he checks out. Billy walks out to the street, slowing down only briefly when a police jeep rushes past him. He runs away, the frame freezing on him as he takes a victorious leap. A title card tells us that on the night of October 4, 1975, Billy was able to cross the Turkish border into Greece and flew home to the United States three weeks later. The final shots of the film before the closing credits show Billy reuniting with his family and Susan. In the original version, it was stated after having shown the movie to the Cannes film festival, there was a demand for exchange of prisoners in Turkey to be brought to America."

They give him a gun and tell him to shoot it. Unbeknownst to Flounder, the gun is loaded with blanks. Unable to bring himself to kill the horse, he fires into the ceiling. The noise frightens the horse so much that it dies of a heart attack.In the cafeteria the next day, smooth-talking Eric ""Otter"" Stratton (Tim Matheson) tries to convince the stuck-up Mandy Pepperidge (Mary Louise Weller) to abandon her boyfriend, the uninteresting Marmalard, and date him instead. Bluto proceeds to provoke Marmalard with his impression of a popping zit by stuffing his mouth with a scoop of mashed potatoes and propelling it at Marmalard and table mates, Chip Diller (Kevin Bacon) and Barbara ""Babs"" Jansen (Martha Smith). Bluto then starts a food fight that engulfs the cafeteria.Bluto and D-Day steal the answers to an upcoming psychology test, but it turns out the Omegas planted the exam stencil and the Deltas get every answer wrong. Their grade-point averages drop so low that Wormer needs only one more incident to revoke the charter that allows them to remain on campus.To cheer themselves up, the Deltas organize a toga party, during which Otis Day and the Knights perform ""Shout"". The dean's alcoholic, lecherous wife, Marion (Verna Bloom), attends the party at Otter's invitation and has sex with him. Pinto hooks up with Clorette (Sarah Holcomb), a girl he met at the supermarket, and makes out with her only to learn she is the mayor's 13-year-old daughter. He later takes her home in a shopping cart. Due to the party, Wormer organizes a kangaroo court with the Omegas and revokes Delta's charter and all belongings are confiscated.To take their minds off their troubles, Otter, Donald ""Boon"" Schoenstein (Peter Riegert), Flounder and Pinto go on a road trip. Otter picks up some girls from Emily Dickinson College by pretending to be the fiancé of Fawn Liebowitz, a girl who recently died on campus. They stop at a roadhouse because Otis Day and the Knights are performing there, not realizing that it caters to an exclusively black clientele. The hulking patrons intimidate the guys and they flee, damaging Flounder's borrowed car and leaving their frightened dates behind.Boon breaks up with his girlfriend Katy (Karen Allen) after discovering her sexual relationship with a professor (Donald Sutherland). Marmalard is told that his girlfriend is having an affair with Otter, so he and other Omegas lure him to a motel and beat him up. The Deltas' midterm grades are so poor that an ecstatic Wormer expels them all. He even notifies their draft boards of their eligibility. In the process, before Bluto attempts to speak to the dean, Wormer orders Flounder to speak with the words, ""Well? Out with it!"", whereupon Flounder vomits on the dean.It seems time for the Deltas to give up, but Bluto, supported by the injured Otter, rouses them with an impassioned, historically inaccurate speech (""Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?!"") and they decide to take revenge on Wormer and the Omegas. The Deltas construct a rogue parade float with Flounder's car as its base and wreak havoc on the annual homecoming parade. During the ensuing chaos, the futures of many of the main characters are revealed. The last shot of the film is of Bluto driving away in a white convertible with his soon-to-be wife, Mandy Pepperidge."

tt0078111,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'R']","This film is partly based on an interview with an actual child prostitute that worked in New Orleans during the early 20th century as found in the book ""Storyville, New Orleans: Being an Authentic, Illustrated Account of the Notorious Red-Light District"" by Al Rose.The movie opens with eleven-year-old Violet (played by a 12-year-old Brooke Shields) watching the birth of her baby brother. This echoes her own beginnings as the daughter of prostitute Hattie (Susan Sarandon) and an unknown client. Violet is one of several children living at Madam Nell's (Frances Faye) swanky New Orleans brothel in 1917.Early one morning photographer Bellocq (Keith Carradine) comes calling looking for a model. Hattie poses for him while Violet watches. At first Bellocq finds Violets inquisitive nature a bother, but after a while he starts to like her. Violet seems fascinated by Bellocq as he never seems to want to have sex with the girls, but just photograph them.Even given her tender years Violet has been become part of the brothel business. She is playing in one of the upstairs bedrooms when her mother brings a client in telling him that Violet is a virgin and only for ""French."" Hattie indicates Violet is to follow them back to her room where Hattie climbs on the bed and starts to undress and the client drops his pants and sits down. It is clear that Violet is expected to stimulate him orally. With the resigned sigh of someone who has already done this too many times Violet enters the room, closes the door and the scene ends.When Violet turns 12 arrangements are made to auction off her virginity. Nell gives a dinner party for her best clients during which Violet, dressed only in a sheer, see-though gown is paraded around the table on a platter as the madam announces the auction. A few minutes later, redressed in a white party dress, Violet stands in the parlor while the men of the house bid on her. The winner (Don Lutenbacher), then carries Violet up to a bedroom. A short scream announces the loss of her virginity and we see her client hurriedly depart from the house. When the other girls check on Violet they find her motionless lying across the bed and fear the worst. She breaks out laughing and we realize she is only joking with them, though she winces when she sits up, telling us that her initiation into womanhood has not been completely painless.Violet now becomes a regular part of the brothel lineup, though not always at her convenience. She is interrupted mid-bath by Madam Nell who wants to show her to a rough-looking farmer customer (Hobe May). (This scene involved nudity for Shields and is one of the more controversial in the film).One day Hattie's client/ boyfriend, Alfred Fuller (Don Hood) announces he is moving Hattie and her baby son to St. Louis where he will marry her. His plans don't include Violet as Hattie in her vanity has told him Violet is her younger sister. Hattie promises Violet at the right time she will break the news to him and send for her. Hattie leaves and Bellocq complains to Nell about Violet being left alone. Nell's response is that Violet is now making plenty of money on her own and the only reason Bellocq is concerned is that he has fallen in love with her, something he vehemently denies.Violet misbehaves and Nell orders the bartender (Henry Braden) to take her to woodshed and discipline her. We hear the beating after which a defiant Violet emerges and declares to Nell, ""It didnt hurt!"" When she turns away though we see the whipping was violent enough to shred her nightgown and we can see her bare bottom.This incident causes Violet to leave the brothel and move in with Bellocq. He is opposed to the idea at first but Violet uses her feminine charms to convince him to let her stay. However, she soon becomes bored of just being his photography model and he is not yet prepared to deal with her childishness. After one long nude photography session (This scene involved frontal nudity for Shields and is also highly controversial) they fight and in revenge Violet scratches some of the Belloca's valuable negatives and he throws her out of the house.Violet returns to the brothel, but it is clear that things are not going well there. The Navy has pressured the city into closing the district. At Nell's house items are being sold off one-by-one and the girls are making arrangements to find other places to live. Violet packs her things too, but before she can get far Bellocq arrives, tells Violet he is going to marry her and she agrees. Though a girl as young as Violet usually needs her parents permission to marry it is allowed because she has been abandoned. Violet, the girls and Bellocq celebrate with a picnic along the river.One morning at Bellocq's house after about two weeks of marriage it is clear that Violet has not quite adapted perfectly to the role of a wife as all she seems to do is have sex and sleep, but it is clear that Bellocq still loves her. Violet and Bellocq's breakfast is interrupted when Hattie and her new husband arrive. They demand that Violet come with them and join them in St. Louis as part of a ""proper"" family. Violet is torn between Bellocq and her mother, but as her mother has the firmer legal claim, Violet has little choice but to go with her. At the station her new step-father attempts to take a family portrait of his wife and her son and daughter, but it is clear from Violet's expression that Violet wonders if she can ever go back to being just a child after having lived as an adult."
tt0078163,"['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Mystery']","A French businessman/mobster named Philippe Douvier (Robert Webber) is making a deal with a New York Mafia for a multimillion-Franc drug-smuggling operation, whose officers suspect Douvier of being too old and no longer strong enough to handle it. Douvier therefore attempts to prove his strength by assassinating Chief Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers).Douvier's attempt to blow Clouseau up with a bomb fails, and the subsequent attempt by a Chinese martial artist called Mr. Chong (an uncredited appearance by Ed Parker) is thwarted when Clouseau accidentally knocks him out of a window, believing him to be his (Clouseau's) valet Cato, who has orders to keep his employer alert by means of random attacks. That night, Douvier anonymously calls Clouseau and poses as an informant to tell him the whereabouts of an important criminal involved in the French Connection. Despite being warned by Cato (Burt Kwouk), Clouseau drives toward the location, but his car and clothes are stolen at gunpoint by a transvestite criminal named Claude Russo. Russo drives into the trap and is killed by Douvier's men. Subsequently, the majority of people believe Clouseau to be dead.As a result of this assumption, Clouseau's mad boss, ex-Commissioner Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), is deemed sane, and is to be released from the local mental asylum to try and crack the case, while Douvier's plans continue.In Russo's clothes, Clouseau is taken to the mental asylum, but escapes into Dreyfus' room. Dreyfus faints at the sight of Clouseau, whom he believed dead, whereupon Clouseau disguises himself as Dreyfus and is driven home in a car by operative François.At home, Clouseau finds Cato, who (despite having turned Clouseau's apartment into a Chinese-themed brothel) is relieved to see him alive. Having settled Clouseau's initial anger at Cato, the two plan their revenge on the person who ordered Clouseau's assassination, taking advantage of the belief that Clouseau is dead to conduct their investigations.Dreyfus, led to believe that the man he saw was Claude Russo, is assigned to read a eulogy at Clouseau's funeral. His objections are overridden by political necessity when it is revealed that the speech was composed by the police chief's wife, who apparently is able to dismiss Dreyfus if he refuses to recite. During the recital, Dreyfus is unable to control his laughter at the statements he is obliged to speak, but conceals his amusement by giving the impression that he is weeping rather than laughing. When Clouseau surreptitiously reveals himself among the attendants of the funeral, Dreyfus faints into the burial pit moments before the master of ceremonies completes his oration.Shortly after his wife threatens him with a divorce, Douvier, needing her respectability and her silence pertaining to his crimes, tells his secretary/paramour Simone LeGree (Dyan Cannon) that their courtship must end. Angry, Simone storms out of Douvier's office, giving an impression that she may blackmail Douvier. Douvier therefore gives orders to have Simone killed at a nightclub called Le Club Phut (a play on the word ""clubfoot"").Having been told by a seafaring informant (Alfie Bass) of the possibility of trouble at the nightclub, Clouseau and Cato investigate and accidentally save Simone from being murdered by Douvier's assassins. Clouseau and Cato are separated, because Simone has not noticed Cato and is eager to take Clouseau (whom she considers her savior) home. At Simone's flat, Clouseau tells Simone that he is the supposedly dead Chief Inspector; although Simone denies it- both of them being more than slightly drunk- he eventually convinces her of the truth, prompting her to reveal that Douvier ordered Clouseau's assassination as part of his attempt to impress the American Godfather. When the assassins enter, having tracked them down, Clouseau and Simone escape into the flat below, in which lives Dreyfus. Dreyfus overhears Simone telling Clouseau of Douvier's plans to meet with the New York Mafia Godfather, Julio Scallini, in Hong Kong, but again faints when he sees Clouseau.Clouseau, Cato, and Simone travel to Hong Kong on a Cathay Pacific Lockheed Tristar jet. Disguised as an archaic Chinese under the name ""Mr. Low Key"", Clouseau, Cato, and Simone tail Douvier to Hong Kong, unaware that Dreyfus is also after Douvier.Clouseau impersonates Scallini while Simone distracts the real Scallini, so that Clouseau can uncover Douvier's plans. He succeeds, but the plan goes awry when Clouseau's disguise is exposed. A car chase begins, terminating in a crash. Here, Dreyfus recognizes Clouseau, loses his mind again, and tries to kill him with a Colt Python service revolver, chasing him into a firework warehouse. There, Clouseau eludes Dreyfus, who when trying to hunt him sets the fireworks alight. The resulting explosions, which in turn trigger a chaotic gunfight between all the characters. This leads to the arrests of Douvier and Scallini. Clouseau is awarded for their arrest by the President of France. Thereafter, he and Simone spend an evening together, and talk about their histories."

As the killer laughs sadistically, the little boy picks up his father's gun and shoots Luke dead. Impassively, the boy mounts Luke's horse, claiming it along with its ornate silver-trimmed saddle, and rides off.Several years later, the young boy has grown up into a rugged bounty hunter named Roy Blood (Giuliano Gemma) who rides into the Texan town of Cerriotts on his silver-saddled horse, accompanied by Two-Strike Snake (Geoffrey Lewis), an amusing but treacherous man he recently met outside of town. Snake tells Roy that many have heard the story of the Silver Saddle, and its owner, the boy who avenged his father. He also knows that Roy Blood seems to leave a trail of dead men in his wake. This is why he wants to tag along: Snake collects items of value from the frequent corpses encountered at every turn in the Wild West. Roy's arrival is also noted by Turner, a mysterious blonde-haired cowboy (Gianni De Luigi).Roy meets with Shiba (Licinia Lentini), a well-to-do madam of the town's local whorehouse, who is also an old flame who wants more.

The blond cowboy appears and makes a deal with Snake who offers it to Roy: $2,000 for a hit on one Thomas Barret, to be executed in a graveyard out of town. Roy is suspicious, but accepts the murder contract when he hears the name of Barret.At the graveyard, Roy is crouching with a rifle aiming at carriage that rolls up as arranged. Instead of the old man Roy was hoping to shoot, a young boy (Sven Valsecchi) emerges, carrying a funeral wreath. As the child approaches, several men emerge to shoot him.

He runs to the local radio station and confirms that the actor died in an automobile crash in California the day before (around the same time he was watching 'East of Eden' in the opening scene).Jimmy J. calls his friend Billie Jean Turner (Lisa Blount), a working-class girl who also admires Dean, to commiserate. He then leads his girlfriend Charlotte Smith (Deborah Benson), his roommate Hanley (Tom Hulce), and another college couple, Frank (Dennis Quaid) and his girlfriend Pat (Mary Kai Clark), on an off-campus adventure. They order a takeout barbecue meal and Jimmy J. steals a few bottles of liquor from a store. They evade the police and have a party near the Arkansas River, where Jimmy J. grows upset that his friends do not understand the depth of his grief. When Frank asks how Jimmy J. can care so much about someone he has never met, Jimmy J. explains that he has seen 'East of Eden' four times, and Billie Jean claims to have seen it 22 times; they were anticipating the releases of James Dean's other two films, 'Rebel Without a Cause' later in October and 'Giant' the following year, Jimmy J. and Billie Jean met seeing 'East of Eden' a few months earlier, and though Charlotte claims Billie Jean presents no competition, she has asked Jimmy J. not to see her.Later that afternoon, Jimmy J. sculpts an Academy Award statuette out of mud, strips to his underwear, smears himself with mud, and conducts a ceremony to summon Dean's spirit. A dog barks in the distance and Jimmy J. perceives the bark as a sign. The police arrive, but the group escapes and heads back to town. When Frank and Pat are dropped off, they tell Jimmy J. that he is disturbed. When Jimmy J. asks Charlotte if he can continue the seance at her house since her parents are not home, she invites him and Hanley to visit once Jimmy J. is cleaned up.Returning to the dormitory, Jimmy J. is surprised to see his mother (Collin Wilcox), his Aunt Ethel, and his little brother, Dickie, who have come to take him to a show in Little Rock.

The three young men escape from the building just as a college dance is starting to be held. They drive to Billie Jean's house and once inside, Jimmy J. finds Billie Jean in her room dressed like the character Vampira, wearing heavy makeup and a black cape. She attempts to seduce Jimmy J., and when he rebuffs her, she tells him that James Dean would not have pulled away.Charlotte is not pleased when the three young men arrive at her parents house with Billie Jean. Despite Charlotte's protests, Billie Jean darkens the room, lights candles, and clears the furniture. When Charlotte and Jimmy J. are alone, she says she suspects that something is going on between him and Billie Jean. Jimmy J. admits he is untrustworthy, like his father, but he has not had sex with Billie Jean. Later, the group uses a Ouija game board to contact Dean, but only Jimmy J. and Billie Jean feel his presence. Charlotte goes to another room and Billie Jean kisses Jimmy J. passionately. Hanley suggests he join in, and Jimmy J. is outraged that his friend would show such a lack of respect for the moment.

When the police arrive, Billie Jean drops a candelabrum and her cape catches on fire, leaving her badly burned.

Eugene is also present as part of the college marching band, and he also acknowledges Jimmy J. by waving to him.Later, Jimmy J. visits Billie Jean, who has come home from the hospital and has not spoken since the accident. She is covered in bandages except for the right side of her face. When Jimmy J. speaks to her, she does not reply and he says it reminds him of the last scene in East of Eden. Jimmy J. confesses that he went to Memphis, Tennessee, the previous night and watched James Dean in the film 'Rebel Without a Cause' four times so that he could tell Billie Jean about it. He recounts how the movie parallels his own life and explains that he is responsible for Billie Jean's injuries the same way James Dean's character is responsible for Plato's death in the film. Jimmy J. apologizes and says he needs her forgiveness because he is leaving for California to visit the spot where James Dean died. When Billie Jean does not answer, he pleads with her, warning her that her mother plans to send Billie Jean to a clinic for shock treatment.

Her mother, Melba Lou Turner (Susan Tyrrell), comes upstairs responding to the noise and becomes upset when Billie Jean reveals that Jimmy J. told her about the shock treatment. Uneasy, Jimmy J. claims his words conjured a scene in a movie; ""when life is feels like a movie, it is more real than at any other time"". When he tells Billie Jean that she once agreed with him, both she and her mother tell the young man that life is not a movie and he leaves.At the football game, Jimmy J. watches Charlotte's coronation as football queen from behind a fence.

tt0078346,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'SciFi']","Note: italicized text denotes extended scenes not from the original cut.June 1938. The film opens to a child reading a comic book about the Daily Planet, the largest newspaper in the city of Metropolis. As the child reads, the shot dissolves to the real Daily Planet and up into the sky. The following title sequence moves through space and eventually reveals the planet Krypton, the home world of a highly-evolved race resembling humans and bearing a unique molecular density and structure, a result of the planet's gravitational strength and the radiation of its adjacent red sun. The planet is ruled by a Council of Elders, each representing a particular ""clan"" and bearing a crest of that particular House. The planet's greatest scientist, Jor-El, bears an S-shaped crest, the House of El. He is supervising the trial of three criminals caught attempting to overthrow the planet's government: General Zod, the planet's former defense chief; his henchman Non, a hulking killer unable to speak; and Ursa, a woman determined to exterminate men other than the man she loves: Zod. As the elders render a guilty verdict, Zod notes that the verdict must be unanimous, so Jor-El ultimately holds the key to their fate. Despite his disillusionment with the Council of Elders, Jor-El renders a conviction. The vast dome of the planet's capital city opens to the night, and a small extra-dimensional prison - the Phantom Zone - tumbles out of the sky and pulls the three criminals out of the trial room and into an eternity in dimensional limbo through space. While a frightened Ursa begs for forgiveness, Zod defiantly swears that he will have his vengeance on the House of El, even if it takes him a thousand years.However, Jor-El's more pressing concern lies in the orbital shift of Krypton; this shift is putting the planet into the fatal gravitational pull of its central star, a fact blithely ignored by the Council Of Elders. The leader of the Council forbids Jor-El from warning the larger populace or he will be imprisoned in the Phantom Zone himself. Jor-El promises to be silent and that he and his wife will not attempt to leave the planet. Jor-El chooses instead to construct a crystalline starship for his infant son Kal-El. Jor-El's wife Lara, however, is concerned, for the starship is programmed to take the child through a trans-galactic warp to a planet populated by primitive humans whose technological development is millennia behind Krypton, a planet that orbits a yellow sun, a planet called Earth. Jor-El, however, understands that the planet's yellow sun will give Kal-El superhuman powers, which will give him the advantage he needs to survive. Jor-El and Lara bid their child goodbye before Joe-El installs a green crystal into the ship, a crystal containing the very essence of himself and Lara as well as the knowledge of the entire universe. He then completes the assembly of the starship - just as the planet is pulled into a fatal plunge toward its red sun. The starship is launched and escapes the system scant minutes before the planet is torn open, collides with its central star, and both bodies are obliterated in a holocaust of fire and debris.The tiny starship passes the Phantom Zone before accelerating on its journey to the planet Earth, with the voice of Jor-El providing the infant, who is aging as the ship proceeds, with knowledge. The ship finally reaches Earth in the year 1951 A.D. and plunges like a meteor into a vast wheat field near Smallville, Kansas - within sight of local farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent. Upon seeing the meteor the Kents discover the now-three-year-old Kal-El. Martha, believing the child is a gift from God, decides to adopt him. The child demonstrates that he is different when, as Jonathan is changing a tire on his truck and the jack slips, he innocently lifts the vehicle with his bare hands, saving his foster father's life.After the truck is thus repaired the Kents and their newly adopted son drive away, leaving the meteor behind - but as its energy fades out it is clear it will become significant to the Kents in due time.Some fifteen years pass and Clark, named for Martha's maiden name, is a student at Smallville High School. He is a water boy on the school's football team, and friends with cheerleader Lana Lang, but is frequently bulled by Lana's jock boyfriend, Brad Wilson. Clark knows of the vast power he possesses but is forbidden by his father from showing it - although, alone on a football field, he kicks a ball into orbit, then runs home by outrunning a speeding passenger train, and is seen by a young girl who tries to tell her parents; her mother, however, scolds young ""Lois Lane"" about telling tall tales.Clark returns home as Brad, Lana, and other students drive by, surprised that he arrived home so quickly. Jonathan, however, reassures Clark that he is on Earth for a reason and that he should not let others bother him. Clark thus feels better, but as he starts to play with the family dog, Jonathan suddenly stops, having lost feeling in his left arm. He then falls to the ground, victim of a heart attack. After Jonathan's burial the grieving Clark blames himself, ""All those powers, and I couldn't even save him!"".Some time later Clark is awakened early one morning by a mysterious noise, emanating from the barn. Clark enters the barn and finds the remains of the meteor, and with it the now-activated green crystal of Jor-El. Later that morning, Clark tells his mother that he must leave and head north. Martha, having known this day would come, urges her son to always remember her, and the tearful Clark vows to do just that as they embrace for one final time.Days later Clark reaches the North Pole, where he takes the green crystal and throws it miles into the distance, where it melts into the ice and begins construction of a gigantic crystalline fortress, a Fortress of Solitude. Inside Clark finds a matrix table of crystals; placing one into an aperture, he activates a dimensional communicator that reveals the preserved consciousness of Jor-El, his true father. Jor-El provides the youth with his true identity of Kal-El and takes his son on a journey through time and space to complete his maturation, educating him on the universe and on his purpose in life. When the journey ends, Kal-El has aged twelve years to the age of 30, although in the time-twisting of inter-dimensional travel the Earth has aged 22 years to the year 1978 A.D. The scene reveals the now fully matured Kal-El dressed in a red-and-blue costume with a long red cape and bearing his family symbol, ready to fulfill his purpose of protecting his new homeworld.-------------------------Metropolis, the greatest city in the world. At the skyscraper home of its largest newspaper, the Daily Planet, photographer Jimmy Olsen is shooting photos of a typically kinetic day in the life of the Planet, including ace reporter Lois Lane (who despite this status has a problem with spelling, frequently being corrected for misspelled words). Lois and Jimmy are introduced by the paper's grumpy editor, Perry White, to its newest member, a tall shy bespectacled news writer named Clark Kent. Lois is initially puzzled by the man's shyness and mild social clumsiness, and is particularly struck when the two of them are held up in a back alley by a gunman. Clark faints when the thug opens fire on Lois (the fainting is cover so Clark can catch the bullet in his bare hand, which causes the gunman to run), and in defending himself to Lois rattles off a listing of all the items in her purse.As Lois and Clark hail a taxi, walking past them is a white-dressed heavyset man munching on snacks and carrying a copy of the Planet. The man is tailed by Harry and Armis, two undercover cops, for he is Otis, an assistant for criminal genius Lex Luthor, and he is on his way to Luthor's secret hideout. The cops tail him to Metropolis Grand Central Station, where Harry sends Armis to get backup while he tails Otis onto subway Track 22 leading out of the station. Otis eventually finds an indentation in the underground tunnel and waits for a train to arrive. A doorway opens under the cover of the passing train, and after it is gone Harry goes to the doorway to try and figure out how to open it - a fatal mistake, for monitoring the scene from hidden security cameras is Luthor himself, who activates the doorway and violently pushes Harry into the path of another train.Luthor's moll, Eve Teschmacher, is appalled by the scene, but Luthor arrogantly and condescendingly reminds her that it is an inevitable by-product of his status as the greatest criminal mind of the latter 20th century, a status to which he takes egotistical delight. He tells her how his father (a cruel man who disowned Lex as a child), once told him that even if governments and economies collapse, people will still need land, and will do anything to get it. This has guided his criminal career ever since. When Otis arrives in their underground lair he is reminded of his clumsiness in allowing himself to be followed again. Thus he is given the unglamorous task of feeding ""the babies,"" a group of unidentified unseen creatures in a vast pit used to dispatch intruders. Luthor's more pressing concern, however, lies in a story in the Planet that two nuclear cruise-type missiles with hypersonic speed are to be tested using live multi-megaton warheads soon. Luthor intends to use the missile test to fulfill the greatest real estate swindle in history.Later that night, Lois Lane is scheduled to fly via Planet helicopter to Metropolis International Airport to greet Air Force One, but on the Planet's helipad she boards the chopper and when the chopper begins takeoff, a light cable breaks free of its bracket and in the updraft caused by the chopper snags its landing skids, breaks, and plunges the chopper out of control through the helipad's control shed and crashing onto the ledge. As police hustle panicking bystanders on the streets below to safety, Lois tries to crawl out of the chopper, but the ledge begins to crack and the chopper sags violently toward the street and Lois falls through, hanging on by a seat belt in the air.But amid the panic in the streets, Clark Kent emerges from the Planet and notices a yellow rain hat on the sidewalk. Upon recognizing it as one Lois was wearing, he sees the stricken chopper, and while those around him run for safey, Clark keeps his head, even while finding a suitable hiding place to change takes a bit of hunt in the vicinity. Running to another building down the street, Clark opens his shirt to reveal his emblem and then whirls through a revolving door at super speed to become effectively invisible and changes into Superman - to the awe and confusion of a nearby pimp.Superman takes off, just as Lois loses her grip on the seat belt and plunges towards the street below. Superman safely catches her and carries her upward. The chopper now breaks off the ledge and falls, but Superman safely snags it out of the air with one hand and carries it back to the Planet's helipad to the astonishment of the crowd below. When the awe-struck Lois asks who the stranger is, he merely replies, ""A friend."" She faints from pure exhaustion and disbelief.It is but the beginning, for Kal-El undertakes numerous feats of heroism - stopping a cat-burglar using gigantic magnets to scale the Solow Building, intercepting a boatload of bank-robbers, rescuing a cat from a tree, and rescuing Air Force One when a lighting strike shatters its portside engine and wing.The next morning, he returns to the Fortress of Solitude and consults the spirit of Jor-El to convey the emotions he felt upon making his full power known. Jor-El urges him to be circumspect in his power and praises him for what he has learned so far.After that busy night, Superman dominates the news about this astounding man doing his good deeds with seemingly impossible abilities. Watching the news about the stranger, Lex Luthor sees his arrival as a natural challenge, considering that Superman would surely have the inclination and the power to interfere with his scheme, and the criminal mastermind vows to destroy all that the stranger represents. Perry White, for his part, makes discovering the red-and-blue stranger the #1 priority of the Planet and sends his entire staff scurrying to find any scrap of information about ""this flying whatchamacallit."" Lois, however, scoops everyone when she gets a note requesting a dinner date at her penthouse from ""a friend.""The dinner date takes place and as part of the interview, in which Superman astounds the cynical reporter with his sincerely kind, courteous and altruistic personality, Kal-El gives Lois a ride in the sky - a flight that becomes almost a romantic dance as the two begin falling in love. Kal-El returns Lois to her apartment and the two bid reluctant goodbye. Lois quietly dubs him a true super man - and uses the term to identify the stranger in her subsequent front-page story. Luthor reads it and remembers a scientific theory; Superman's homeworld would be of a molecular construction that would be affected by the unique radiation of a yellow sun, and that meteors from Krypton upon landing on Earth would be affected to the point of emitting a radiation that would affect only Kryptonians. Such a meteorite was found in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Miss Tessmacher is skeptical, as even with ""the rock,"" Superman could see them coming from miles away. But the interview hints at another weakness: Superman has difficulty seeing through lead. With their plan in place, they plan a trip to Ethiopia.Later, Luthor's gang go to work intercepting the two missile convoys used for the big upcoming test; using a variety of guises, they divert attention away from the effort to reprogram the missiles' directional vectors; Otis, however, misprograms one of the missiles, attributing this mistake to his arm not being long enough to write down the coordinates. Luthor violently attacks him for gross incompetence, but Miss Tessmacher calms him down while keeping the car they are in from crashing.The Planet learns that an unknown figure is buying up hundreds of acres of seemingly worthless desert in the southwest. Suspecting land fraud, Perry sends Lois and Jimmy to investigate. Had Clark showed more initiative and confidence, the assignment would have gone to him. As Perry shares a story about a ""worthless meteorite"" being stolen from an Ethiopian museum, Clark is struck by a piercing signal, a high pitched hum followed by the sound of every dog in Metropolis barking at once- it is Lex Luthor on a radio frequency only Superman (and the dogs) can hear. Luthor warns Superman that a poison gas pellet containing propane lithium compound is to be released into the air and kill the city's population unless Superman confronts him alone. Feigning a migraine, Clark sneaks away from his co-workers and jumps out a window, where he changes into Superman mid-flight and traces Luthor's signal to the street. He spins himself around and manages to drill through the ground and into Luthor's hideout, where he is attacked by the hideout's automated defense system - a wall of machine guns, then a wall of fire, finally a wall of liquid nitrogen that freezes the area. None has any effect on Superman, who casually walks through it all unharmed.Once inside the hideout, Superman demands knowledge of Luthor's gas pellet. Luthor lets the truth be known that it is a hoax, it was the only way to gain an audience with him. Luthor reveals his true plans for the stolen missiles; the first will destroy the San Andreas Fault, which will collapse the Western coastline of the US (namely California and its major cites) into the ocean and thus make the seemingly worthless desert of the west into multi-billion dollar windfalls. The second missile is designed to be a cover. Luthor boasts that nobody, not even Superman, can bring down both of them, and if necessary, he can detonate either warhead via remote. Superman notices a box made of lead which he assumes hides Luthor's detonator. But when he opens it he is struck by a massive weakness, for the box contains the Ethiopian meteorite - Kryptonite, fitted to a chain necklace that Luthor drapes around him. He takes great delight in reminding Superman that despite his aura of invincibility, a normal human has found a way to beat him. Superman asks if Luthor even cares about the second missile's target (the one misprogrammed by Otis) which is revealed to be Hackensack, NJ, before Luthor drops him into his pool to drown.Luthor, however, has made a fatal mistake, for due to Otis' misprogramming, Eve Teschmacher's mother lives in Hackensack. While Luthor and Otis monitor the errant missiles on their hypersonic flight, she pleads with Superman to stop the Hackensack missile first on his mission; he agrees and she frees him. Regaining his power, Superman blasts through the mammoth ceiling of the lair, into the sky, and on a direct course west. He tries to stop the first missile over Kansas but it dodges him, and he must overtake it and force it into space - just as the second missile detonates the San Andreas Fault, setting off an omnicidal quake that is like the destruction of Krypton all over again, a nightmare that doubly drives Superman as he flies underneath the Earth's crust to stabilize the land.However, the aftershocks prove no less deadly, and Superman flies all across the area rescuing people from the ensuing disasters. But amid his enormous feats of heroism, one person in particular needs help. Amid the aftershocks, Lois's car runs out of gas in the middle of a desert, and is swallowed by a massive fissure, effectively burying her alive. Superman eventually senses she is in danger. He finds the car and pulls it out of the ground. He quickly takes Lois' body out of the car, but is too late. She has suffocated and died. Superman tearfully kisses her, and then lays her body down. He stands over it silently for several moments. Superman finally screams a thunderous roar of anguish and then rages into the sky. He hears the voice of Jor-El, which reminds him that he must not interfere with human history. Recalling his failure to save Jonathan (""All those powers, and I couldn't even save him""), he becomes absolutely determined to save Lois. Pulling together all of his power and strength, Superman flies around Earth's perimeter faster and faster eventually reversing the planet's rotation and pulling time back with it. He soon fixes it back to its original direction and uses the extra time to get to Lois before her car is buried.As revenge for her betrayal, Luthor and Otis are preparing to drop Miss Teschmacher into the pit of ""the babies."" Superman, however, rescues her, and pointedly notes to Luthor that Miss Teschmacher's mother sends her love.Afterward, Superman delivers Luthor and Otis to a maximum security prison to hold them pending trial. Luthor shouts his defiance (mirroring Zod in the opening moments), but he is comically interrupted by Otis. As both men are led away by the guards, the prison warden thanks Superman for his good deeds. Superman humbly dismisses the praise as just his contribution to their mutual effort for the good of society even as he takes off into the high atmosphere to resume the patrol of his adopted home planet. Once there, Superman, happy that his self-appointed neverending battle has had a satisfying beginning, looks to the audience with a wink and a smile as he flies off for more adventures."

tt0078437,"['Adventure', 'Horror']","A light aircraft is flying over spectacular jungle terrain. On board is oil prospector Robert Harper (Massimo Foschi), his business partner Ralph (Ivan Rossimov), the pilot Charlie (Sheik Razak Shikur), and a young lady named Swan (Judy Rosly). There is much talk about inhospitable and harsh the jungle is which is apparently Malaysia. They are on their way to visit a oil prospecting party which has set up camp there.Upon landing, they find the area abandoned. They soon discover a native weapon covered with blood. Ralph is concerned, exclaiming that the weapon indicates the people who raided the camp are; ""worse then natives. Judging the way this was made, they're still living in the stone age."" Harper wonders into the jungle, while Ralph follows him and they both get lost. During their trek through the jungle, they discover the partially-decomposed corpse of one of the prospectors. Harper and Ralph manage to return to the airstrip where the seriousness of their predicament becomes apparently. But since they wondered off, it is too late for them to take off for darkness comes and they decide to sit out the night in the plane.Later that night, Swan unwisely decides to leave the plane so she can relive herself in the nearby bushes. She is captured by several unseen natives. The three men are all too scared to help even though they hear her screams, convincing themselves that they should stay put for the night and look for her in the morning when it is daylight.The next morning, Harper, Ralph, and Charlie set out into the jungle to look for Swan. Within minutes, Charlie springs a native trap and is horribly impaled by a spiked ball. Momentarily losing his mind at the sight of his dead friend, Harper runs blindly into the jungle followed by Ralph. This time, they really do get hopelessly lost. After witnessing a group of native warriors eating the remains of Swan, the two men continue on and come across a river. They decide to make a raft to float downstream and hopefully make it back towards the airstrip. During the ride, their raft overturns on some rocks, and Harper is left alone as he grabs onto a shore rock as Ralph is swept away by the current.Over the next day-and-a-half, Harper wonders aimlessly through the trackless and inhospitable jungle dealing with insects, snakes, and other wildlife. Desperately hungry, he unwisely gorges himself on mushrooms, starts to hallucinate and soon passes out. When he wakes up, he finds himself surrounded by dozens of long-haired, savage natives, warily poking their spears at him. The natives take the captive Harper back to their camp which is a huge cave dwelling place.The savage natives tie up Harper where they strip him naked, and string him up in a harness and hoist him into the heights of the misty cave. Having seen him arrive by airplane, the natives apparently believe that he has the power to fly, so they let him freefall 60 or more feet before he is abruptly halted by the harness and rope device to which he is attached to. His painful ordeal continues again and again until he passes out, while the natives wave their arms and hoot hellishly.Over the next several days, Harper is imprisoned in a cage and forced to watch the natives and their lifestyle. He is fed dead and rotting small animals, as well as subjected to further torture and humiliation. Harper watches the natives bring a captive warrior from a rival tribe and have him slowly killed by tying the warrior's arm to an army ant hill where they ants slowly eat the captive warrior alive.Harper befriends one of the very few women of the tribe, a native woman who, despite the language barrier, introduces herself as Pulan (Me Me Lai). But she is held in check by Harper's guards who forbid her from talking to their prisoner. Harper soon becomes clear at what the natives have in store for him: they apparently want to use him as bait to catch a very large meal like a crocodile the natives catch after using a bird to catch their prey. He is forced to watch the natives kill, skin, and eat the crocodile among other various animals from a python to a tree monkey.One evening, Harper decides to make his move. He tricks Pulan into opening his cage, and then grabs her as well as bludgeoning the guard watching him. Harper escapes from the cave with Pulan as a hostage/guide. When she tries to escape, he attacks and savagely rapes her, cementing their bond. Being violated, Pulan apparently decides, by her tribe's custom, to become his companion and servant.One day during a sudden rainstorm, Harper and Pulan come across a cave, and find Ralph, who is alive and well and been hiding out from the natives this entire time. However, Ralph's mobility is impaired by a festering leg wound which he got during the overturning of their raft. Both men decide to force Pulan to lead them back to the airstrip to their plane so they can return home. The next day, the three of them set off as Ralph explains more about jungle survival. At one point, Ralph ensnares a cobra, milks its venom, and applies it to the end of Harper's makeshift lance.Pulan's hesitation about traveling through cannibal country is soon justified when they are surrounded by dozens of natives. In the chase, Ralph is hit in the chest by a spear, while Pulan is also hit and falls prey to her fellow native people and quickly killed. Harper is forced to help Ralph along as Pulan is gorily beheaded, sliced open, and gutted. Hot coals are place into her gaping chest cavity and her flesh is eaten.By the time the cannibals catch up to the two men, who make it to the river, Ralph is weakening fast from his fresh wound and can no longer defend himself. So, Harper is forced to fight against one of the cannibal natives. Harper kills his opponent by stabbing him with the poisoned lance. His assimilation into the savage ways of the jungle is completed when in devastating fashion, he disembowels his foe, pulls out an internal organ, and eats in front of the native warriors who watch the whole thing. Following this show of strength, the intimidated natives slowly back away and allow Harper to continue on his journey, carrying his barely conscious friend with him. Harper and Ralph finally follow a track from the river and make it back at the airstrip with the plane still sitting in its place. As the natives look on from a respective distance, Harper places Ralph in back of the plane, starts up and engine and takes off, finally free from his ordeal. But in the back seat, Ralph after hearing from Harper that they have made it and are on their way home, kneels over and dies having succumbed to his wounds."

At his local high school, his classmates are pressuring him to become involved in criminal activities. Seeing that his mother of low self-esteem doesn't understand him or his unhappy feelings, Diego runs away from home. Diego takes a job at a garage run by auto mechanic Anselmo (Fiorenzo Fiorentini). After only a few days of working there, Diego accidentally causes some damage to a car which is in for repairs. Diego runs away from the garage fearing Anselmo will report him to the police.A few days later, Diego meets Marco (Luigi Diberto), the flamboyantly gay coach of a swimming team who takes him on as an assistant warden at the local pool. Diego's passion for swimming pushes him to train at night when the pool is closed. It is during one of these solo nighttime sessions that Marco sees Diego swimming laps and recognizes the boy's potential as a championship swimmer. The president of the sports club (Jacques Sernas) hears about Diego's swimming prowess, and allows him to join the team where he soon becomes the team captain, provoking the envy of the other athletes. Diego's first swim meet is when he takes part in the Italian junior championship and wins first place, which overjoys Marco and his younger sister Claudia (Vittoria Galeazzi) whom begins to have strong romantic feelings for Diego since meeting him in a low-key way earlier when he was hired by Marco.

Here, Diego is reunited with Claudia, who finally reveals her romantic feelings for them, and the two of them fall in love, with Marco's approval. She oversees his training and even when Diego goes to the hospital for further treatment, she gives him a blood transfusion to help him gain some of his energy back.Diego, Marco, and Claudia travel to Amsterdam with Diego fully confident in his ability to take on the challenge of the great race. On the day of the big championship, Diego starts off the race in spectacular fashion where, in the first few lengths, he wipes the floor with the opposition. But gradually, his illness makes itself felt and he slows down swimming. The crowd, aware of his health problems, continue to cheer him on while his swimming becomes more labored. One by one, the other swimmers overtake Diego, but he does not give up and continues to swim, floundering until he completes the race in last place and to a standing ovation from the spectators. Diego emerges from the pool and is embraced by Claudia, and then collapses to the ground exhausted. Diego tells Claudia and Marco that it was never his intention to win, but to show that he could still make the entire course to prove himself. Diego, aware that his days are numbered, slowly walks out of the arena to live out his last days in peace with Claudia."

He drives off in his fathers car, which breaks down, and Anthony is left stranded near a beach, left to sleep in a ditch over night with his belongings.The next morning, Chicano stoner Pedo De Pacas (Cheech) sets off from his Mexican-family-house in his lowrider car looking for love with errands to run. Pedro drives along the beach where he tries to pick up ladies, and sees Anthony with melons stuffed under his shirt. Assuming that Anthony is a large-breasted woman, Pedro drives his car around and tries to pick ""her"" up, only to be horrified when he discovers Anthony is just a guy looking for a ride.Feeling bad (and liking that Anthony likes his car), Pedro gives Anthony a ride, just missing being caught by the police. While driving, the 2 take a liking to each other being that they both like smoking marijuana. Pedro offers Anthony a small joint, while Anthony shows Pedro a huge joint, made out of dog feces (being that the dog ate Anthony's stash). The 2 smoke the joint and get incredibly high, followed by Pedro accidentally swallowing a lot of acid. The car crashes into a light pole, and the 2 are arrested and the car towed away. In a small courtroom trial, the 2 are being prosecuted when Anthony, still high, begs for water. Pedro grabs some of the judge's ""water"" for Anthony, only to have Anthony spit it out, revealing it to actually be vodka. With the judge taken away, Pedro and Anthony are let off free.The next morning, after Anthony meets (and argues) with Pedro's band (being that Pedro is a guitarist/singer and Anthony is a drummer), the 2 set off to score some weed. However, the town is dry being that many people are smoking pot these days. The 2 visit Pedro's cousin Strawberry, who is a retired war veteran who is a little messed up in the head and has a large ""birth mark"" on his face. Anthony stays in Strawberry's messy apartment while Pedro and Strawberry go off on a motorcycle to get weed. While in the apartment, Anthony meets Strawberry's roommate, a cokehead who throws a large drug party in the apartment. Meanwhile, Strawberry has a war flash and loses his mind and jumps off the motorcycle, sending Pedro crashing. When he crashes, he sees cops hiding outside the apartment, ready to bust in and arrest the druggies at the party. Pedro tries to warn Anthony via phone, which is bugged, and the party is busted. Pedro infiltrates the bust dressed like a re-po man, claiming he's there to reposses the stuff. The cops buy the story, and Pedro rescues Anthony.After that, the 2 visit Pedro's friends' place where the 2 get stoned, but not so much being that the weed is bad. At that point, immigration busts in, being that Pedro's friends calling immigration on themselves to get a free ride to a wedding in Mexico. Of course, Pedro and Anthony, despite their efforts to hide, get caught and deported to Tijuana as well.While in Tijuana, Pedro calls his uncle and gets the address of a upholestry shop and arranges to pick up a van to drive back to America. But after getting fast food over the address, the 2 arrive at the wrong place- an upholestry shop which is actually a marijuana plant in disguise. The factory actually makes materials out of solid and liquid marijuana, which is then smuggled across the border. The marijuana-made things made there are worth up to $9 million, and is heavily watched by police, led by Sargeant Stedanko. Pedro and Anthony show up to the factory, unaware of what it really is, and say they're there to pick up ""the van"". Rather than getting an actual van, the stoners get a huge green van, made from marijuana, top to bottom. From the steering wheel, the tires, the doors, the gas tank, to the very structure of the van itself, its all made of pure solid and liquid marijuana- and the guys have no idea they're smuggling it into America.The stoners drive their marijuana van to the border where they're stopped by police. Anthony is smoking a joint, which he throws out the window into the window of a car full of nuns. Pedro and Anthony are almost caught, when the police discover the joint in the nuns' car. The car is taken away and the nuns searched and arrested by Sgt. Stadenko and his police officers. Unaware of what they did, the hippies drive through the border back into America in their van, stopping at the border patrol station so Anthony can use the restroom. In the restroom, Anthony pees next to Stadenko and accidentally ""shakes himself dry"" on the sargeant's leg before leaving.
An angry chief leaves the bathroom to have the officers tell him that they were wrong about the nuns, its actually 2 hippies in a big green van. Realizing who Anthony must've been and the green van was completely ignored, Sgt. Stadenko and 3 officers get in the police car and set off on the roads after Pedro and Anthony.It isn't long before the cops get sight of the marijuana van being driven by a Chicano and a hippie. They speed up, only for Pedro to get view of 2 hitch-hiking young ladies. He swerves the van across the highway, causing for the police to accidentally shoot the tires off their own police car. Pedro and Anthony (who have no idea cops are pursuing them), pick up the hitch-hikers and drive off. Pedro and one of the hitch-hikers make out in the back while Anthony drives with the other hitch-hiker. Meanwhile, Stadenko has fixed the tires and has continued the search, having no idea where the stoners could've gone.Pedro and Anthony learn from the hitch-hikers that they are actually heading for a battle of the bands concert in Los Angeles, with the winners getting a record contract. Excited, Pedro and Anthony decide to go to the battle of the bands with the ladies and compete. But first, they need to stock up on some weed. The 4 stop the green van at a police station, where a stoner female cop goes to get the 2 ladies illegal marijuana. Pedro and Anthony use this time to play with the intercom and police transmitter, taunting Sgt. Stadenko over the radio. At this point, Stadenko is really upset and he and his cops show up at the station. Stadenko goes to use the bathroom, where Pedro is. Pedro too ""shakes himself dry"" upon Stadenko's leg as Anthony did earlier and leaves, making Stadenko angrier.Pedro and Anthony and the girls, acquired with weed, return to the marijuana-made van and head on to the road again to Los Angeles. However, unknown to the 4, the gas coming out of the van is pure marijuana smoke, getting anyone who inhales really high. This occurs at the police station where someone near the van gets high and a case of the munchies, ordering multiple hamburgers from a nearby fast-food stand. While they drive along the highway, the smoke from the van spreads out the exhaust pipe, getting all driving by with their windows down really high. At one point, a police officer on a motorcycle speeds after them, but inhales the smoke and gets high, and forgets what he's doing. Pedro, Anthony, and the women get away, but the high cop is found by Stadenko, and, while high, reveals where the marijuana van headed off to, and Stadenko follows after the van.The van soon arrives in Los Angeles to the Roxy Theater where the battle of the bands takes place. Pedro and Anthony head into the theater and enter the competition, leaving the ladies behind. While inside getting ready, Anthony isn't feeling good so he takes some pills given to him by the hitchhikers- which turns out to be acid. Anthony slowly gets high, and the smoke from the van enters the vents backstage and gets both Pedro and Anthony very high as they prepare to go on. As a result, Pedro dresses in a pink tutu and a Minnie Mouse bow, while Anthony dresses in a red quaalude.Meanwhile, outside, Stadenko and crew have found the theater, and try to get inside, but are shooed off by real police men, being that they've left their badges in the car and don't have tickets. The van is almost towed away and Stadenko tries to take the van, but is denied the right to have it taken away. A billion dollar bust, gone. Stadenko and the cops hang around the van waiting for Pedro and Anthony, but get high off the smoke, and Stadenko is soon turned into a huge stoner (as seen in the movie Cheech and Chong's Nice Dreams) as the van burns down into nothing but marijuana smoke, getting everyone in Los Angeles really high.Back in the theater, it is Pedro and Anthony's turn to go on. The van has nearly burned down and all the smoke entering the vents has gotten everyone in the theater high. The 2 go on stage, really high from the van smoke, and almost knock over the band equipment. The 2 then play their rock song ""Earache My Eye"" (an actual song on a Cheech and Chong record), about a gay boy trying to live his life. The song is a big smash (even though Pedro had just written it and sang it as he went on), and Pedro and Anthony win the contest and the record deal, although still very high.Days later, Pedro and Anthony are back in California from their whole drugged-up adventure, driving in Pedro's lowrider on the street next to the beach where they first met. They're happy, talking about their new record deal and all the possibilities that can happen, when they decide to smoke some hash. Anthony smokes some and hands it to Pedro, who accidentally drops it in his crotch. Pedro's crotch starts burning up and he freaks out as he and Anthony try to put it out. The car crashes as the hash starts burning up, and Pedro and Anthony (Cheech and Chong), their car, and the record contract are all left, well, up in smoke."
tt0078480,"['Animation', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","The story begins with a prologue, narrated by Michael Hordern, establishing the Lapine culture and mythology and describing the creation of the world and its animals by Lord Frith, the sun god. All the animals co-exist peacefully and eat grass together but the rabbits, led by Prince El-ahrairah, quickly multiply and overwhelm the other animals with their insatiable hunger. When Frith warns El-ahrairah to control his people, the prince scoffs at him, claiming that his are the strongest people in the land. In retaliation, Frith gives to each of the other animals a gift, turning them into predators, or 'elil' that hunt and feed on the rabbits. However, Frith also bestows upon the rabbits the gifts of speed and cunning, enabling them a fighting chance against their enemies. All creatures may seek to kill El-ahrairah and his descendants but, with their wits and quickness, the rabbits may survive.The film then transitions to realistic animation and brings us to the English countryside of Sandleford. Fiver (Richard Briers), a young runt rabbit with prophetic abilities, foresees the end of his peaceful rabbit warren during an afternoon grazing, or 'silflay'. He exclaims to his older brother, Hazel (John Hurt), that the field they live on is covered in blood, but Hazel acknowledges the image as a trickery of the sunset. Regardless, he agrees to take Fiver to the Chief Rabbit to see if they can have the warren evacuated. However, the Chief Rabbit (Ralph Richardson) dismisses them, saying that leaving the warren in the height of the mating season is preposterous enough without it being based on a young rabbit's prophecy. Knowing that his brother's visions have always come to light in the past, Hazel helps Fiver gather any rabbits willing to leave the warren and they all sneak away during the night. They are briefly stopped by Captain Holly (John Bennett) of the Owsla, the rabbit police force, but they manage to fight past him. As they leave the safety of the warren, they pass a sign clearly stating that the lands of their home is due for residential development.In all, eight rabbits successfully defect: Fiver, Hazel, ex-Owsla officer Bigwig (Michael Graham Cox), cunning Blackberry (Simon Cadell), small Pipkin (Roy Kinnear), storyteller and runner Dandelion (Richard O'Callaghan), old Silver (Terence Rigby), and the only female, Violet. They travel into the woods and through the night, encountering dangers such as owls and a large badger, or 'lendri'. Their curiosity is aroused when they stumble upon a road and Blackberry explains that 'hrududu' travel on it but have no interest in rabbits. He proves this by sitting still as one of them, a car, approaches and speeds on by. However, the threat of being killed by such wayward creatures is made apparent when Blackberry is nearly hit by another. A bean field provides some shelter and the rabbits are able to rest. Come morning, Fiver wakes to see Violet leave the safety of the plants to feed on grass and watches in horror as a hawk swoops down and carries her off.One less, they move along and come to a creek in time to hear that there's a dog loose in the woods. With the dog on their scent, and Fiver and Pipkin unable to swim, the larger rabbits use a plank of wood to float them across, swimming alongside. They find refuge that night within a crypt in an old cemetery but are set upon by a band of black rats which draws the attention of an owl. The rabbits escape. The following day they meet a friendly, but odd, rabbit named Cowslip (Denholm Elliott) who offers them food and shelter at his warren. The group is grateful for the hospitality they receive and all but Fiver consider remaining at the warren permanently. He senses something terribly wrong and tries to warn the others of it but they refuse to listen. He leaves in a fit, followed by Bigwig who taunts him before suddenly being caught in a snare trap. Bigwig collapses and begins to choke as the others frantically try to dig out the post the snare is attached to. He coughs blood and appears to stop breathing just as the post is removed. The rabbits mourn their loss as Fiver admonishes them: the warren is given food and protection from a nearby farmer who has laid numerous deadly snares throughout the warren as his price. After this terrifying revelation, Bigwig miraculously recovers and, on Fiver's advice, the band moves on with a new found respect for the seer's wisdom.Eventually, the rabbits come to Nuthanger Farm where Hazel discovers a hutch of female rabbits. Knowing that does will be needed to start a new warren, but deterred by the farm's dog and cat, he promises a young doe named Clover (Mary Maddox) that he will return. As the rabbits move alongside a field, they spot a fox, or 'homba', sniffing out their trail. Bigwig runs out to draw its attention away to the shelter of the woods nearby. The others hear a cry and think Bigwig has been caught but he soon returns and hurries them on, explaining that he ran into a couple of rabbits that tried to stop him despite his warning of the fox. It was presumably one of the rabbits that cried out when the fox caught up.The band continues onward until they find Captain Holly, badly injured and at the brink of death. He briefly recounts the destruction of the Sandleford warren as Fiver predicted, witnessing as the ground was turned up and how he was forced to leave his fellow rabbits within their burrows to suffocate to death by noxious fumes. He mentions a warren called Efrafa before he collapses. Once rested, Fiver leads the group to the place he envisioned, a hill called Watership Down where the rabbits discover empty burrows suitable to live in beneath the shelter of a great tree. They all settle in with Hazel informally recognized as Chief Rabbit. One day, an acerbic seagull crash lands on the warren, his wing injured and leaving him unable to fly. Hazel, seeing the potential of using the gull's skills of flight, offers to help him despite the gull's stubborn pride. Kehaar (Zero Mostel) is allowed to rest at the warren and, as Hazel hoped, notices with disdain the lack of female rabbits and 'chicks'. He berates the rabbits for not keeping a better warren but eagerly agrees to survey the area for females once his wing heals. When he manages to take flight, Hazel opts to return to Nuthanger Farm with two other rabbits to try and free the caged does.Hazel and Blackberry make it to the barn and start chewing away at the hinges to the doe's crate while Dandelion keeps watch. However, he inadvertently alerts the dog and farmer to their presence just as the crate door is broken open. The farmer wrangles up the does as the other rabbits try to escape. Hazel is hit in his hindquarter by shotgun pellets as they flee and Blackberry and Dandelion are forced to leave him behind. They return to the warren to tell Fiver of his brother's demise, sentimentally stating that the Black Rabbit of Inle, 'death', does no more than his appointed task. However, seeing a vision of the Black Rabbit, Fiver claims his brother is not dead and follows the vision to an old pipe where a trail of blood leads to Hazel, his heart still beating.Kehaar returns to Watership Down and helps remove the buckshot pellets from Hazel's hindquarters, using his beak. He speaks of the Efrafa warren nearby which houses many rabbits. Holly pipes up and warns the other rabbits not to go there; it is a dangerous warren ruled tyrannically by a chief named General Woundwort (Harry Andrews). It was Woundwort's Owsla that injured Holly and, were it not for the brave actions of a doe named Hyzenthlay (Hannah Gordon) and the appearance of one of Frith's 'messengers' (a train that cuts down pursuing Owsla), he would never have escaped. Bigwig offers to infiltrate the warren. Arriving at Efrafa as a newcomer wishing to join, he impresses General Woundwort and is offered a familiar spot on the warren's Owsla as an officer with the option of choosing a female for himself. He meets with Hyzenthlay and tells her of his free warren. In time, they recruit other defectors including Blackavar, a rabbit with several bodily scars and bitten ears, severely maimed for his many escape attempts.After meeting with Kehaar and relaying his plans to leave that very night, Bigwig is confronted by General Woundwort who overheard Kehaar's loud calls. Bigwig manages to convince him that their talk was of no concern, though Woundwort remains suspicious. That night, as a thunderstorm approaches, Bigwig takes his band of Efrafans and escapes. However, the ever-vigilant Efrafan Owsla gives chase, led by General Woundwort. A timed attack by Kehaar keeps the General at bay while the rabbits make way for the river. Echoing their earlier use of driftwood, the rabbits leap into a small boat and break off the moor just as the Owsla arrive at the banks. Bigwig and the other defectors safely drift downstream and make their way to Watership Down.However, several days later, their trail is picked up again by Efrafan trackers and General Woundwort vows vengeance on Bigwig. As an unknown to Woundwort, Hazel approaches the Efrafans to negotiate. He offers an alliance of free and independent warrens living peacefully together, but Woundwort casts his intrigue aside and dismisses Hazel, ordering him to tell Bigwig to surrender the defectors. Hazel returns to his warren and instructs all the rabbits to hole up inside their burrows and block the entrances as the Efrafans begin their assault. Panic-stricken, Fiver falls into a trance, moaning as he envisions a 'dog loose in the woods'. His sounds briefly scare the Efrafans and inspires Hazel to formulate a plan. He brings with him the fastest runners; Hyzenthlay, Blackberry, and Dandelion, and they escape the warren. Woundwort orders his Owsla to ignore them, intent on finding Bigwig whom he believes to be the chief rabbit.On their way, Hazel prays to Frith and offers his life in return for the safety of the warren, but Frith replies that it is a bargain he cannot honor. Along the way, he positions each of the rabbits at different intervals until he and Dandelion arrive at Nuthanger Farm. Dandelion exclaims that, if they succeed, theirs will be the greatest story ever told. Hazel assures him that he will be the one to tell it as he makes his way towards the farmer's dog, sleeping in its dog house. Hazel chews away at the dog's leash as Dandelion draws its attention. The dog chases after Dandelion as Hazel is pounced upon by the farmer's cat (Lynn Farleigh). However, the farmer's daughter, Lucy (Michelle Price), orders her cat to let the rabbit alone and Hazel is freed.The dog, meanwhile, is led by the rabbits in relay fashion back to Watership Dow; the plan nearly goes awry with the dog stops to urinate and nearly finds the last, and exhausted, runner before Hyzenthlay is able to get the dog's attention to continue the final leg of the relay. Meanwhile, General Woundwort makes his way inside the burrows, fiercely killing Blackavar after he attacks Woundwort in a delaying tactic. In a last-ditch effort to protect the warren, Bigwig buries himself beneath the dirt of one of the tunnels and, as Woundwort approaches, lunges out in surprise and attacks him. The rabbits ferociously bite and scratch at each other until they are both bloodied. Woundwort asks why Bigwig won't simply surrender and Bigwig responds that his chief ordered him to protect the warren. Woundwort hesitates, surprised that Bigwig is not chief and imagines that he now has a larger rabbit to reckon with. At that moment, the dog arrives at the warren and begins tearing the Efrafan Owsla apart. They all scream and scatter as Woundwort emerges out of the warren and curses them for their cowardice, claiming that dogs aren't dangerous. He then sees the dog come out from behind the tree, dropping a dead Efrafan from its mouth before it charges towards him. Woundwort fearlessly leaps to confront the dog and it is said that, after this encounter, his body was never found and he wasn't heard from again. His legacy lives on as a story that does tell to their kittens as a way to keep them obedient; that if they misbehave, General Woundwort will get them. For all the menace that tyrant was, the general opinion is that he would have found that kind of monument pleasing in its own way.In epilogue, an elderly Hazel settles in to silflay when he is visited by a shadowy phantom, revealed as Prince El-ahrairah in the form of the Black Rabbit of Inle. El-ahrairah suggests that Hazel has been feeling tired of late and offers him a place with his Owsla. When Hazel looks back warily on his family at the warren, El-ahrairah assures him that they, and future generations, will be safe. Reassured, Hazel lays down in the grass and peacefully passes away. His spirit leaves his body and follows El-ahrairah through the woodland and into the afterlife.""All the world will be your enemy, Prince with a Thousand Enemies. And whenever they catch you, they will kill you. But first, they must catch you; digger, listener, runner, prince with the swift warning. Be cunning and full of tricks, and your people will never be destroyed."""
tt0078492,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Thriller', 'War']","Colonel Allen Faulkner (Richard Burton), a middle-aged British mercenary and former Royal Army officer, arrives in London from Switzerland to meet the rich and ruthless merchant banker Sir Edward Matherson (Stewart Granger) at his West London row-house. The latter proposes an operation to rescue Julius Limbani (Winston Ntshona), imprisoned former leader of the fictitious central African country of Zembalia, who is due to be killed by the military dictator who overthrew him. Limbani, whose people believe he is already dead, is being held in a remote prison, guarded by ferocious African troops known as the ""Simbas"", under General Ndofa.Faulkner provisionally accepts the assignment and sets about recruiting his officers, all of whom have worked with him on previous African operations. They comprise:Lt. Shaun Fynn (Roger Moore) is a former RAF pilot. He is working as a currency smuggler, but when he realizes that he's actually running drugs, he kills the mafia drug dealer and consequently has a death contract placed in his head. Matherson forces the crime boss to lift the contract at the last moment.Lt. Pieter Coetzee (Hardy Krüger), is a South African mercenary who only wants to return to his homeland and buy a farm, but can barely afford to pay his rent in London.Captain Rafer Janders (Richard Harris) is hired as an experienced mission planner. He initially refuses the job, as he's making some money as an art dealer and is planning a Christmas vacation with his son, Emile. But Faulkner persuades Janders to join the mission as the tactician.Retired R.S.M (Regimental Sergeant Major) Sandy Young (Jack Watson), is asked by Faulkner to serve as drill sergeant to train the troops and assist in recruitment. He is very willing, but his wife strongly disapproves.With the tacit approval and support of the British government, the 50 soldiers are transported to an unspecified African location, equipped and mercilessly trained by Young. The day before the mission is to begin, Janders exacts a promise from Faulkner to watch over his son Emile, and take care of him should Janders die on the mission. Faulkner agrees.The 50-man mercenary group are transported by plane and parachuted into the African country near Zembala Prison on Christmas Day. Coetzee uses a powerful crossbow with cyanide-tipped quarrels to take out the prison sentries. The rest of the guards are killed silently with cyanide gas. They rescue Limbani, but he is clearly a sick man and is later hit by crossfire during the battle. All of the Simba guards, along with one Cuban Army officer and advisor, are killed in the battle. The group, suffering no casualties, then commandeers several jeeps and other military vehicles from the prison and makes its way to a small airfield to await pickup.But backers of the project, led by Matherson, reach an agreement with the Zembalese government concerning valuable copper mining concessions, and the airplane due to collect them is recalled at the last minute.From this point onward, the abandoned mercenaries are forced to fight their way through hostile territory, pursued by the Simbas. It is also revealed here that Cuban, Soviet and East German army officers are training and advising the Simbas on their fighting skills and giving them orders to take out all of the foreign mercs.Meanwhile, the relationship between Limbani and Coetzee develops from initial animosity: ""I bleed red like you, white man; don't call me kaffir"" to one of understanding, as Coetzee comes to understand and appreciate Limbani's struggle, and realizes that white and black must work together.As they make their way south, heading for Limbani's home tribal land, they approach an old rickety wooden bridge. Only the first few vehicles make it across, when they come under aerial attack by a Simba fighter bomber aircraft that drops napalm. The bridge collapses under the weight of a fuel tanker, leaving the last jeep stranded on the northern river bank. In that jeep is Limbani, Coetzee, and medical orderly Arthur Whity (Kenneth Griffith).The mercenaries separate into two groups to continue to make their way to Limbani's home village, where they intend to provoke a revolution. However, most of the allied rebels are too ill-equipped and weak to fight. During all of this, Faulkner is forced to kill his own men who are gravely injured by the airstrike. Coetzee observes, ""we can't leave them to the Simbas"", whom will torture them to death.Coetzee is then killed while saving Limbani from a Simba ambush, leaving another soldier, a young Nigerian named Sgt. Jesse Link (John Kani), to carry Limbani. Witty is killed by machete-armed Simbas while trying to fend off another ambush, allowing the rest of the platoon to escape. Faulkner is reunited with the rest of the remaining 32 mercenaries at Limbani's village where an Irish missionary, named Father Geoghegen (Frank Finley), alerts them to the presence of an aging transport plane, a Douglas C-47 Skytrain aka ""Dakota"" at an old runway to provide for their escape.At the airfield, the mercs make their last stand in a climatic battle. As the masses of Simba troops attack, the group guns down dozens of attacking Simbas, while transporting the wounded Limbani on a stretcher to the plane, but many mercs are killed in the fierce battle, including the teenage soldier Esposito (Glyn Baker). Sandy Young is killed while he is running with Faulkner to board the airplane. Faulkner makes it on board, along with the tough gung-ho merc Tosh Donaldson (Ian Yule). Jesse Link also manages to safely get on board with several mercenaries carrying Limbani. While in the cockpit reading the plane for takeoff, Fynn is shot in his left leg, but manages to keep the plane moving. The last remaining mercs, including a wounded Jock McTaggart (Ronald Fraser), manage to board, but Janders is badly wounded after getting shot in his left side and can't get onto the moving plane; he implores Faulkner to shoot him as he is running down the runway with mobs of Simba troops in chase right behind him. Faulkner cannot bear to shoot his friend, but there is no hope. As Janders cries out his son's name: ""Emile! Emile!"", Faulkner reluctantly shoots and kills him just as the plane takes off.The plane with the wounded Limbani and the surviving mercenaries, numbering only 13 men out of the original 50, is initially refused landing permission in nearby Rhodesia, but after they provide proof that Limbani is aboard, they are given permission to land at Kariba. But by the time they land, virtually out of fuel, Limbani has died of his wounds. Flynn passes out, wounded but still alive despite blood loss. Seeing that Limbani has died, Faulkner regards the whole mission a failure.Three months later, having managed to return to London, Faulkner breaks into Sir Edward's residence, holds him at gunpoint and takes half of the originally agreed payment from his safe. He then kills him. Faulkner and Flynn make a quick getaway.In the final scene, Faulkner fulfills his promise to Janders; he visits Emile at his boarding school. Faulkner offers to tell Emile about his father."

When he catches a glimpse of a mysterious woman en route to her wedding, he is instantly obsessed by her beauty, and - despite the presence of his lover Samantha Taylor - follows the woman to the church where he crashes into a police cruiser and is stung by a bee. George visits the priest, and learns that the woman is Jenny Miles, daughter of a prominent Beverly Hills dentist. Later that night, Sam and George have an argument about George's failure to give her the attention she needs, his use of the term ""broad"", and the fact that he and his neighbor (a wealthy porn producer) watch each other perform carnal acts using telescopes. The final straw for Sam occurs when George makes a remark subtly impugning her femininity at which point Sam leaves in a huff.The following day, George and Sam suffer a series of mishaps that prevent them from reconciling, including George spying on his neighbor until hitting himself with his telescope and falling down an embankment, causing him to miss Sam's phone call. In addition, George schedules a dental appointment with Jenny's father, and while in the dentist's chair, subtly leads the dentist into disclosing that his daughter and her husband went to Mexico for their honeymoon. The examination also reveals a mouthful of cavities, requiring the dentist to spend the entire afternoon inserting fillings in George's teeth. The after effects of the novocaine, which are aggravated by his heavy drinking immediately after, leave him completely incoherent and when Sam finally reaches him on the phone she mistakes him for a madman and calls the police. The police storm his house, but recognizing him they leave amicably. He visits his neighbor's house to take part in an orgy just as Sam arrives at his house, and she spots him through his telescope, widening the rift between them.Later, George impulsively follows the newlyweds to their exclusive hotel in Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico. In the bar, George encounters an old acquaintance, Mary Lewis, who suffers from a lack of self-confidence because she blames herself for a series of failed relationships. When they attempt a fling that night, she interprets George's inadequacy in bed as confirmation of her insecurities despite her better-than-average looks and easygoing disposition.One hot day at the beach, George sees Jenny - suntanned and dressed in a one-piece swimsuit and her hair braided in cornrows - which furthers George's obsession. He notices that David, Jenny's husband, has fallen asleep on his surfboard. Pretending to inquire about renting a surfboard, George learns that beyond a certain point are powerful currents that can sweep a swimmer or surfer dangerously far from land. George rents a catamaran, clumsily but successfully rescues David, and becomes a hero. Both Sam and his songwriting partner see him on TV Network News and Sam tries to call him, but George (unaware that it is Sam) refuses the call. David, badly sunburned, stays in the hospital, allowing Jenny and George to spend time alone together, culminating in Jenny seducing him to the sounds of Ravel's Boléro.Although George is initially elated to find all of his fantasies being fulfilled, he is horrified when Jenny takes a call from her husband while in bed with him and casually informs him of George's presence. He is even more confused when David responds with a complete lack of concern (he had called to thank George for saving his life). When Jenny explains their open relationship and mutual honesty, George is appalled; with the thrill of enjoying forbidden pleasures extinguished, he loses interest in Jenny (Jenny, for the opposite reasons, loses interest in him as well) and he heads back to Beverly Hills.At the end of the film, he reconciles with Sam by demonstrating a new maturity and, taking an idea from Jenny, he starts Ravel's Boléro on the phonograph and they make love with the music playing in the background. This is in full view of the neighbor's telescope shortly after the neighbor has walked away in disgust, complaining that he has had enough of providing erotic entertainment to George and getting nothing in return."

tt0078748,"['Horror', 'SciFi']","The opening credits appear in front of a large planet with rings. Out in the far reaches of deep space the Nostromo, a commercial towing space vehicle, carrying a refinery with twenty million tons of mineral ore, is en route to Earth with a crew of seven. Inside, the ship appears eerily quiet, but suddenly, the on-board computer is activated. Lights inside the ship are activated, and a room with seven biobeds is illuminated. The canopies open to awaken the crew. Executive Officer Kane (John Hurt) is the first to awaken from hypersleep. They congregate in the mess hall, where they cheerfully enjoy a meal. Chief Engineer Parker (Yaphet Kotto) and Engineering Technician Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) take the opportunity to discuss the bonus system, which they find unfair, as they get paid less than the officers. Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt) is called away by MOTHER, the ship's computer, before they can have a meaningful conversation. Dallas enters the MOTHER console room, and tries to assess the situation, as the rest of the crew gets in the cockpit of the ship to determine their location. They quickly deduce that they are nowhere near home yet. Navigator Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) finds out that they are at Zeta II Reticuli, an outlying system. When Parker and Brett return from their round of the lower deck, complaining about their colleagues' attitude and the bonus system, Dallas briefs the crew: the ship is not even halfway home, and has altered its course because it has picked up an unknown signal, which repeats every 12 seconds. The crew has been awoken from hypersleep to investigate. Parker protests, arguing that they're not a rescue team and that they should be compensated for the extra work, but Science Officer Ash (Ian Holm) stipulates that per Company contract, the crew is obliged to investigate any signal from an intelligent source; non-compliance will result in loss of pay, which quickly puts Parker in a more cooperative mood.The crew assembles in the cockpit to listen to the signal. It sounds very strange and unearthly, perhaps like a voice. Lambert homes in on it and finds that it comes from a planetoid, 1200 km in diameter, with a two-hour rotation and some gravity.The Nostromo approaches the planet, which is close to one enormous ringed planet and two smaller ones. The ship separates from the refinery, and sets course to the planet's surface. It descends toward the planet, but the landing is rough, causing damage that will take some time for Parker and Brett to repair (although they allot themselves several more hours than their own estimate). The planet is windy, and visibility is low. As the source of the signal is 2000 meters away and the sun is coming up, Dallas and Kane decide to investigate on foot. A reluctant Lambert is ordered to join. Ash takes place behind an outer window with a communication console, as the team puts on their space suits and leave the ship to investigate the signal on the planet's windy surface. In the meanwhile, Warrant Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has gone to the lower deck to inspect the repairs. Parker and Brett ask if there will be a bonus for any discovery which is made on the surface; Ripley assures them that the law guarantees them a share, before returning upstairs, as they keep teasing her. Outside, the team walks between the rocks, through the planetoid's inhabitable atmosphere. Inside the ship, Ash tells Ripley that MOTHER has not yet deciphered the signal; she volunteers to give it a try. Ripley accesses a console and starts working on the strange signal.Outside, the sun is up and the wind has died down. The team clears the rock formation, and makes a fascinating discovery. Near the horizon, they see a derelict spacecraft of unknown origin. It is lying against the rocks, vaguely shaped like a horseshoe. Despite Lambert's hesitation, they approach it, losing contact with the Nostromo upon entering the massive ship through an opening at the side. Inside, they find hallways with walls textured like bones. At the end is an elevated platform. It carries the remains of an enormous alien creature in a large chair, now fossilized. Upon initial examination, there is evidence of some unknown trauma to its chest: its ribs are bent outward, as if it exploded from the inside. Lambert wants to leave. Kane then draws the others' attention to a large hole in the floor. Meanwhile, analysis of the unidentified transmission suggests that it is not an SOS, but a warning. Ripley wants to go after the search party, but Ash talks her out of it, reasoning that by the time she gets there, the search team will probably know what the signal means.Kane is lowered into the hole by means of a winch. He finds an enormous tube-like chamber down below, divided into sections and basins. He nears one basin, discovering thousands of leathery objects that resemble large eggs. He also discovers a strange light and mist covering the eggs that reacts when broken. He trips and falls into the pit, but is uninjured and moves in to investigate further. Kane touches one of the eggs, which seems to give a shriek. He illuminates the egg from behind with a flashlight and discovers movement inside. He grabs a pistol: a strange, spider-like organism is the resident. The egg has flaps on top which open, revealing its insides. As Kane moves into for a better look, the strange lifeform inside suddenly leaps out, attaching itself to Kane's helmet, melting his faceplate.Ash is looking towards the planet's surface, when he sees Dallas and Lambert carrying the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo. They enter the airlock and ask Ripley to let them in, while Ash waits at the inner airlock door to open it. They inform Ripley that an organism has attached itself to Kane's face. Ripley hesitates, citing quarantine protocol: for the safety of the crew, Kane should first be decontaminated for 24 hours before being brought on board. Dallas fears for Kane's life and orders her to open the door, but she refuses, despite Dallas trying to pull rank. However, Ash disregards Ripley's decision and lets them in.In the infirmary, Dallas and Ash cut Kane's helmet open: they find that a spider-like creature has attached itself to Kane's face, with eight finger-like legs, and a long tail tightly wrapped around his neck. Despite his mouth being blocked, Kane is breathing normally. Parker, Brett and Lambert observe through a window. Ripley joins them, and is angrily slapped by Lambert, furious for not allowing them to re-enter the ship; the men break the women apart. Dallas berates Ripley for disobeying a direct order, but Ripley furiously replies that she was just following the rules of quarantine protocol. Ash attempts to remove the creature from Kane's face with a pair of forceps, but it merely tightens its grip, and is holding on so tight that it will tear Kane's skin off with it. Kane is examined with a sophisticated medical scanner, which shows that the creature has inserted a tube into Kane's throat and is feeding him oxygen. Ash deduces that since Kane is comatose and the parasite is feeding him oxygen, removing the creature may kill Kane, however Dallas is willing to take the risk.Ash tries to cut off one of its legs with a scalpel, but a yellowish fluid pours out of the wound and begins to eat through the floor. Out of concern that the acidic fluid will breach the hull, the crew runs several floors downstairs, and find that the stuff's corrosive effect is neutralized after burning through several decks. Dallas says the substance resembles molecular acid, and Brett comments the creature must be using it for blood. ""Wonderful defense mechanism - you don't dare kill it"", growls Parker. Dallas orders everyone back to their posts, as Kane is left in his coma to be tended by Ash.Parker and Brett resume their repairs, commenting that they should never have landed on the planet. As Kane's situation remains unchanged, Ash is collecting data on the creature. He is startled by the sudden presence of Ripley in the infirmary. She wants to know what he has found out yet. Ash can only confirm that the creature's skin is made up of polysaccharides, which it is slowly replacing with silicon to toughen its hide against the new environment it finds itself within. Ripley then confronts him with his decision to let it aboard, ignoring the quarantine law; Ash defends himself by stating that he did it out of concern for Kane's life, and that he temporarily forgot the fact that Ripley is the officer in charge when Dallas and Kane are away. Ripley replies that by allowing this breech of protocol, he has put all of their lives at risk, which is not appropriate behavior for a science officer. Ash coldly lets her know that he is perfectly capable to make that decision, and she should stick to her own job. Ripley leaves.Dallas is sitting in the Nostromo's escape shuttle, the Narcissus, listening to music, when he is called to the infirmary by Ash, because something has happened to Kane. The creature has detached from Kane's face on its own, and has disappeared. Dallas, Ripley and Ash search the infirmary, and find it when it suddenly drops from an overhead compartment on Ripley; it appears to be dead, only showing basic reflexes. They take a closer look at it, and confirm it is dead. Ripley wants to get rid of it, fearing that it may become even more harmful when dead; Ash strongly disagrees, given the uniqueness of the specimen. He wants to take it back to Earth for more tests, as it is harmless now. Dallas shares Ripley's sentiment, but leaves the decision to Ash, to Ripley's amazement.Ripley tries to talk some sense into Dallas, who is unwilling to listen to her arguments, replying that he only runs the ship, and Ash has the final word on all things concerning the Company's science division. Ripley asks if Dallas has ever worked with Ash before. Dallas mentions that he did five tours with the same science officer, but this person was suddenly replaced two days before the Nostromo left Thedus dock back on Earth. Ripley admits she doesn't trust Ash, but Dallas responds that he doesn't trust anybody. He asks about the status of repairs, which are still underway, but appear completed enough to leave the planetoid. Even though Ripley does not recommend it, Dallas prefers to leave as soon as possible. After a successful take-off and despite some minor technical errors, the ship docks with the refinery and cargo in orbit. The Nostromo then resumes its course for Earth.The crew is back in the mess hall, bickering again about what to do with Kane. Dallas decides they will all get back into hypersleep. Lambert has calculated that it will take another 10 months to get back to Earth, which spoils their moods even further. Ash suddenly calls Dallas to the infirmary. Kane has awoken, still groggy but seemingly unharmed. He remembers very little of the event, apart from a nightmare about smothering, but is starved and wants to eat. The crew decides to have one last meal before they re-enter hypersleep. During the meal, the crew is finally having a good time again, joking and enjoying the food. Kane is eating like he has not had food in ages, sharply observed by Ash. Suddenly, Kane begins to choke. After initially thinking he has swallowed something bad, the mood suddenly changes when Kane starts to groan and convulse violently. While he lies writhing and screaming on the table, the crew tries to help and stabilize him, but his chest suddenly bursts, and a small snake-like alien creature erupts through his rib cage. It silently observes its surroundings. Parker moves in to kill it with a knife, but he is stopped by Ash. The creature screeches, then scurries away quickly, leaving the crew stunned and horrified.A quick search through the deck yields no results whatsoever. After a short funeral for Kane, where his body is jettisoned into space, the crew members separate into two teams to capture the small creature. Brett assembles a weapon similar to a cattle prod, while Ash rigs together a tracking device. Parker, Brett and Ripley investigate one of the lower decks, finding that the power has been disrupted despite repairs having been finished. Picking up a signal, they think they have the creature cornered in a cabinet. They prepare to catch it in a net, only to be startled by the discovery that it is the crew's cat, Jones, who had found a quiet place inside the cupboard, and runs away. Realizing they might pick up the cat on the tracker again later, Parker sends Brett off to catch Jones. As Brett is searching for Jones, he finds a mysterious object resembling a shed reptile skin on the floor. He continues on to a hold housing one of the ship's landing struts, eventually catching up with Jones. A strange creature is hanging in the chains above him, seemingly observing him. As Brett tries to coax Jones out, the cat hisses when a huge shape drops down behind him. It is the creature, however now with four limbs, an elongated head, fully grown and towering over Brett. Brett turns around, and is mesmerized while looking at the creature opening its mouth, revealing a second set of teeth which quickly extends from the mouth, biting Brett in the head, and dragging him, bloodied and screaming, above into an airshaft. Ripley and Parker hear him and arrive just in time to catch a glimpse of the monster as Brett disappears and blood drips down.Parker and Ripley can only confirm the creature is big and escaped through the air ducts. Brett is assumed dead. The crew debates their next move. They all agree that the alien is using the air shafts to move around, so if they could drive it from the ducts into an airlock, they might be able to blow it out into space. Ripley asks Ash if he can offer some helpful information as a scientist; Ash suggests the alien may be afraid of fire, as most animals are. Fortunately, there are several flamethrowers on board. Ripley volunteers to enter the air shafts, but Dallas overrules her by volunteering himself. Dallas enters the MOTHER console once more. He tries to get the MOTHER computer to evaluate their procedure to get rid of the alien, but MOTHER simply cannot provide an answer, due to lack of input. He tries to get MOTHER to offer suggestions, but again, the computer cannot compute, due to lack of available data. Finally, Dallas types ""What are my chances?"" The computer replies that it cannot compute.The main airlock is prepared by Ripley and Ash for the decompression procedure, while Parker and Lambert position themselves where they can measure movement inside the ducts. The main duct is opened and Dallas enters the network of air shafts with a flamethrower, allowing the crew to remote-close valves behind him as he proceeds. Lambert uses a motion tracker to get his location, when she suddenly catches another signal going towards him. Assuming it is the alien, Dallas uses the flamethrower to make sure that one of the ducts leading down is safe. He ascends a ladder to the lower duct, but the alien's signal is lost in the meanwhile. He finds a puddle of slime on the floor. Lambert assures him that the alien cannot be far, so he uses the flame thrower around him to scare it out of hiding; nothing is there. Dallas is disoriented in the cramped space and starts to panic, when the other signal starts moving again, at higher speed to his location. Lambert desperately urges him to move away. He descends another ladder, turns around, running straight into the shrieking creature stretching its arms towards him. Static and feedback interrupt the line, and then there is only silence.Parker puts Dallas' flamethrower on the table, saying it was just laying in the duct: ""no blood, no Dallas."" Lambert looks as if she is near a nervous breakdown, while Ripley is desperately trying to hide her apprehension. She suggests that in absence of a better idea, they should continue with Dallas' plan. Lambert says it is madness, and suggests abandoning the ship with the shuttle; however, the shuttle cannot sustain four people. Parker also opposes the idea, and wants to kill the creature; even if this means entering the entire duct system again, and blowing the alien out of the airlock. He leaves to refill the flamethrower. Ripley once again tries to get helpful information from Ash, but he says he is still analyzing. She scoffs at him for being so little help, and decides to go and try MOTHER for answers, since she now has access in light of Dallas' absence.Ripley accesses the MOTHER console, and queries MOTHER for answers as to why they are unable to neutralize the alien. MOTHER responds that she cannot clarify. Ripley asks MOTHER to explain why not. MOTHER replies that she cannot, referring to Special Order 937, which is only meant to be read by the science officer. Ripley uses a command override to force MOTHER to explain what Special Order 937 entails. MOTHER displays the following shocking text: ""Nostromo rerouted to new coordinates. Investigate lifeform. Gather specimen. Priority one: insure return of organism for analysis. All other considerations secondary. Crew expendable."" As she contemplates the cold, hard words, she suddenly finds Ash sitting next to her, saying there is an explanation for this. Furiously, she grabs and shouts at him, sobbing uncontrollably. She leaves the console, trying to contact Parker and Lambert, but she finds that Ash is closing all doors leaving the mess hall, preventing her from leaving. She demands that he open the doors, but Ash simply stares at her. She notices a drop of white liquid running down his face, and he starts to have facial twitches. Unnerved, she tries to run away, but he suddenly grabs her hair; Ripley breaks free, pulling out a lock of hair, and tries to run. Ash quickly catches up and throws her against a few walls. While she is barely conscious, Ash uses a rolled-up magazine in order to suffocate her. She starts to struggle fiercely as Ash starts to twitch and make incoherent noises. Suddenly, Parker and Lambert arrive, both trying to drag Ash away from Ripley. Parker howls in pain as Ash grabs a piece of skin on his chest, forcing him to let go. Parker quickly grabs a fire extinguisher and hits Ash with it in the back. Ash starts to convulse and shriek violently, making very inhuman sounds while spitting out white liquid. Parker gives him another blow with the extinguisher, dislodging Ash's head, revealing Ash is an android. He keeps pounding Ash until he is on the floor, white liquid gushing from its insides. Ash's movements start to decrease and Parker settles down, but suddenly, the decapitated body grabs him and forces him onto a table; Lambert finally grabs the electric prod and screams as she stabs Ash in the back with it, finally rendering the android lifeless.With Ash disabled, Ripley theorizes that the Company sent him along to bring an alien back for their weapons division, as Ash was always very protective of the creature. They reconnect his disembodied head to see if he can give them any advice on how to deal with the creature. Ash confirms that his order was to bring back the lifeform, even if it meant sacrificing the crew. Ripley asks how they can kill the creature. He tells them they have no chance against it, as it is ""the perfect organism"". He has a silent admiration for it, ""a survivor, unclouded by conscience, remorse and delusions of morality"". When he mocks their chances of survival, Ripley disconnects him again. The three survivors decide to follow Lambert's earlier suggestion; set the Nostromo to self-destruct and escape in the shuttle, leaving the Alien to die on the main ship. As they leave the room, Parker turns the flamethrower on Ash's corpse, incinerating his remains. Ripley will prepare the shuttle for launch, while Parker and Lambert go to gather coolant for the shuttle's life-support system.While prepping the shuttle, Ripley hears Jones meowing on the ship's open intercom system, and realizes the cat is still left behind. Lambert and Parker are in the hold gathering equipment. They proceed to a small room where the coolant is stored. Ripley ventures out alone, into the hallways of the Nostromo to find Jones the cat. Expecting the alien at every turn, Ripley finally locates the cat in the cockpit, where he startles her as he suddenly jumps into view. She puts him into his traveling container. In the meanwhile, Parker and Lambert are working so feverishly on the supplies, that neither of them pays attention to a large shadow that has appeared inside the room. It is the alien, and it closes in on Lambert. Ripley can hear Parker over the open intercom, shouting to Lambert to get out of the way, but the alien has cornered her against the wall. Parker is unable to get a clear shot at it with the flamethrower without risking harm to Lambert, as it is hulking over her. Finally, he charges at the creature, but it rapidly spins, whipping the flamethrower out of his hands with its long tail, and grabbing him with its large claws. Despite his struggle, the creature holds a tight grip, opens its mouth, and its bizarre inner jaws pierce Parker's head, instantly killing him. As Ripley rushes towards their position, she is powerless to prevent the creature from turning back to Lambert. It curls its tail around her, and the final thing that Ripley can hear from the intercom are the sounds of Lambert, crying, sobbing, gagging and screaming. Ripley finds their bloodied and lifeless bodies in the storage room, with no sign of the alien.In terrible shock, Ripley dashes towards the emergency room without stopping. Between the sobs, she locates the ship's self-destruct mechanism and quickly completes the entire procedure to activate it. The voice of MOTHER now announces that the self-destruct mechanism has been activated, and the ship will detonate in 10 minutes; however, the self-destruct can still be canceled during the first five minutes. Ripley takes a ladder to the lower deck, where she hears a soft groan. She inspects the hold, and finds a strange organic structure adhering to the walls and machinery. Shocked, she finds Dallas stuck within the adhesive, barely alive. On the opposite wall, she notices a shape which vaguely resembles Brett; he seems to be dissolving, transforming into an object like the eggs seen in the derelict ship. Dallas very weakly begs Ripley to kill him. After some hesitation, she grants his dying request: she burns them both with the flamethrower and rushes out of the chamber.Ripley crawls up a ladder, and runs towards the shuttle with Jones in the container. She briefly rests against a wall, when she suddenly hears the alien stirring around the corner. Terrified, she drops the cat container and carefully retraces her steps along the wall, as the alien slowly comes into view around the corner. It shows interest in Jones. The alien slams the container against a wall. Ripley races back to the self-destruct mechanism and tries to override the procedure; however, she is too late, as the mechanism is already starting to activate. She restarts the cooling unit, but MOTHER announces that it is too late to stop the countdown, and the Nostromo will explode in five minutes, much to Ripley's frustrated anger. With sirens blaring and steam releasing from the vents, Ripley runs back to the shuttle loading area, ready to make her best attempt to fight off the alien and get into the lifeboat. However, the alien is nowhere to be seen, only the cat container lying on its side. As fires start to erupt, she picks up Jones and boards the shuttle with only one minute to abandon ship. She quickly runs through the launch sequence, and the shuttle lowers to launch position as MOTHER starts counting down the last 30 seconds of the Nostromo's life. The shuttle's engines ignite and the shuttle races away, leaving the Nostromo in the distance. A series of mighty explosions follow as the Nostromo vanishes in fire, destroying the refinery and ore it had been carrying. Ripley is relieved it destroyed the alien along with it.Ripley gives Jones a hug and prepares one of the biobeds for hypersleep, putting Jones in it. As she makes final preparations for the shuttle, a hand suddenly reaches out to her from a wall; she shrieks, and in horror, she sees the alien lying in an alcove. In fact, it had stowed away aboard the shuttle, its external physicality making it blend in with the ship's machinery. She flees into a locker with space suits inside, and notices the alien is not following her; it remains lying in the alcove, seemingly unable to do something. Ripley gets an idea, and dons one of the space suits. She arms herself with a harpoon gun, then straps herself into a chair while singing ""You Are My Lucky Star"" to calm her nerves. Opening a series of air vents above the alien's head, Ripley tests them one at a time, and then finds one that directly blasts high-pressure steam onto the alien, driving it shrieking from its hiding spot. As she is activating several buttons, she does not notice the monster creeping up to her from the side, until it is standing next to her to its full, menacing two-meter height, ready to attack with its inner jaw. Screaming, she opens the shuttle's airlock door. Everything not secured, including the alien, blasts towards the door. However, the alien grabs the edges of the doorway to prevent itself from being sucked outside. Ripley quickly fires her harpoon before the creature is able to haul itself in; it pierces the screaming alien, which lets go of the doorway and blasts outside, the wire connecting the gun to the harpoon pulling the gun out of Ripley's hands. However, the door slams shut, jamming the wire under it. Still tethered to the door by the wire, the alien undauntedly attempts to re-enter the shuttle by climbing inside one of the heat thrusters. However, Ripley sees the opportunity and fires the engines, incinerating the alien, and sending it drifting into space.Before she and Jones enter hypersleep for the journey home, Ripley records a final log entry, stating that Kane, Lambert, Parker, Brett, Ash and Captain Dallas are dead. Cargo and ship are destroyed. She expects to reach the frontier in six weeks, and to be picked up by the network. She signs off as Ripley, last survivor of the Nostromo, and gets into hypersleep."

tt0078767,"['Horror', 'contentRating', 'R']","""The Amityville Horror"" (Released July 1979) is based on the true story of George Lee Lutz (James Brolin, of ""Marcus Welby, MD"") and Kathy Lutz (Margot Kidder, fresh from the success of ""Superman"") who bought a charming Dutch Colonial home in Amityville, on the coast of Long Island NY, in 1975. A sign in front of the house gives its name as ""High Hopes.""The film is based on the book of the same title, by Jay Anson, published in 1977. (Anson did not work extensively with the couple, but worked from hours of taped conversations between George and Kathy, which they had turned over to him.)The home features the Dutch gambrel (barn-shaped) roof design, and a pair of quarter-circle windows, on the end, on the 3rd floor, up near the roof. These are illuminated to look like the home's eyes. Filmmakers modified a house in New Jersey to look like the actual home in Amityville, and it is surprisingly close.It is a documented fact that a troubled young man, 28, had shot his entire family to death in the house, on 11/13/1974, including father, mother, two brothers and two sisters. Thus, in the film, the history of the house allows the Lutz's, in the fall of 1975, to make an offer of $80,000 on the home, which, we are told, is easily worth $120,000.Despite full disclosure of the home's past, by the realtor, the couple proceeds with the purchase, and moves in. George appears not to be strong of faith, but Kathy is at least a nominal Catholic. The couple turns to Father Delaney to bless the home. Father Delaney (Rod Steiger) encounters troubles in trying to bless the home, including a room full of flies, out of season, violent stomach sickness, and later, blisters on his palm when trying to make even a phone contact with Kathy at the home.In his further efforts to confront the evil, he suffers a car wreck from brake and steering malfunction, a lack of support by his superiors in the diocese as he describes the occult things he's seen, and ultimately, blindness and a mental breakdown.It is most moving when he, at the altar of the church, is praying, ""Give them strength of mind and body, that they may do Your will,"" and a high-mounted statue begins to crumble and drop dust down in the chancel area. Refusing to run, he continues the prayer at a scream, ""Oh, Lord, give them strength of mind and body, that they may do Your will!"" weeping at the seeming triumph of evil over good. After this, we are shown Father Delaney, sitting in an outdoor garden area, in a totally unresponsive state. Presubably, his mind is gone. George begins to be more sullen and angry over perceived cold in the house, and obsesses with splitting logs and keeping the fireplace stoked. One of the two boys suffers a crushed hand when a sash window falls on it, and the little girl has an imaginary friend, Jody, who seems to be of a malevolent nature. Mom, Kathy, catches a glimpse of two red, swine-like eyes, outside the daughter's 2nd story window. The family dog, Harry, a black labrador, obsesses over a secret room in the basement.George's land surveying business begins to suffer with his lack of attendance, and his partner is concerned. The business partner's wife, very sensitive to the paranormal, is at once both revulsed and intrigued by the things she feels when at the house. ""Boy are these vibes ever strong!"" she says at one point.The Lutz's witness a black, bubbling substance coming up in the toilets, an ""ooze"" coming down from nail holes in the walls, a babysitter being trapped in a closet despite its not having a locking doorknob, the disappearance of $1,500.00 cash, and Kathy's Aunt, a nun, running from the house and vomiting. Kathy observes George's persistant waking at 3:15 am, feeling he must go check on the boathouse, and other unsettling incidents. Kathy has nightmares in which she is given details about the killings of the home's prior family.Their research at the library and at the county records office suggest that the house is built atop a tribal burial ground, and that a known devil worshiper named Ketcham had once lived on the land.Finally, the paranormal events drive the family to flee the house one night, in the pouring rain, no longer even worried about their posessions. The final titles tell us that, ""Today the Lutz's live in another state."""

tt0078788,"['Drama', 'Mystery', 'War']","The story opens in Saigon, South Vietname late in 1969. U.S. Army Captain and special operations veteran Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen), has returned to Saigon on another combat tour during the Vietnam War, casually admitting that he is unable to rejoin society in the USA and that his marriage has broken up. He drinks heavily, chain-smokes and hallucinates alone in his room, becoming very upset and injuring himself when he breaks a large mirror.One day two military policemen arrive at Williard's Saigon apartment and after cleaning him up, escort him to an officers trailer where military intelligence officers Lt. General R. Corman (G. D. Spradlin) and Colonel Lucas (Harrison Ford) approach him with a top-secret assignment to follow the Nung River into the remote jungle, find rogue Special Forces Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) and ""terminate his command with extreme prejudice"". Kurtz apparently went insane and now commands his own Montagnard troops inside neutral Cambodia. They play a recording of Kurtz' voice, captured by Army intelligence where Kurtz rambles about the destruction of the war and a snail crawling on the edge of a straight razor.Willard is flown to Cam Ram Bay and joins a Navy PBR commanded by ""Chief"" (Albert Hall) and crewmen Lance (Sam Bottoms), ""Chef"" (Frederic Forrest) and ""Mr. Clean"" (Laurence Fishburne). Williard narrates that the crew are mostly young soldiers; Clean is only 17 and from the South Bronx, Lance is a famous surfer from California and Chef is a chef from New Orleans. The Chief is an experienced sailor who mentions that he'd previously brought another special operations soldier into the jungles of Vietnam on a similar mission and heard that the man committed suicide. As they travel down the coast to the mouth of the Nung River, Willard's voiceover reveals that hearing Kurtz' voice triggered a fascination with Kurtz himself.They rendezvous with reckless Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore (Robert Duvall), a commander of an attack helicopter squadron, the infamous 1st of the 9th Air Cav (Cavalry), who initially scoffs at them. Kilgore befriends Lance, both being keen surfers, and agrees to escort them through the Viet Cong-filled coastal mouth of the Nung River due to the surfing conditions there.The next morning, Kilgore launches a brutal helicopter assault on the Viet Cong village amid air and napalm strikes on the locals and 'Ride of the Valkyries' playing over the helicopter loudspeakers, the beach is taken and Kilgore orders others to surf it amid enemy fire. While Kilgore nostalgically regales about a previous strike, Willard gathers his men to the PBR, transported via helicopter, and begins the journey upriver.During the long journey that occupies the bulk of the story, Willard sifts further through the Kurtz dossier, learning that he was a model officer and possible future general. Back in 1964 after returning from a tour of duty in South Vietnam, the 38-year-old Kurtz had eschewed the promotion, applying several times for Airborne training and had sent a report to his superiors about the war that was deemed classified. In other voice-over narration by Williard, Kurtz returned to South Vietnam in 1966 as a member of the Special Forces for another combat tour, which his fighting methods drew criticism from his superior officers. By the late summer of 1968, Kurtz' combat patrols were coming under frequent ambush which ended in November 1968 after Kurtz ordered his men to summary execute four high ranking South Vietnamese Intelligence officials who he suspected were double agents for the Viet Cong. Despite the fact that the four executed Vietnamese were indeed revealed double agents, the US Army charged Kurtz with murder for taking matters into his own hands instead of going through proper channels which resulted in Kurtz and his Special Forces/South Vietnamese army fleeing into Cambodia.One evening, Willard accompanies Chef into the jungle to pick mangoes when they encounter a tiger. But they both make it back to the boat safely and continue on. Williard sees the tiger encounter and Chef's near-hysterical panic as a stern reminder of the rule to never leave the boat.Another evening or two later, the crew visit a supply depot USO show featuring Playboy Playmates which goes awry when the servicemen attempt to assault the Playmates which the R&R to a quick end.Some time later, the crew inspect a civilian sampan for weapons, but the strung-out Mr. Clean panics and opens fire, prompting Lance to open fire on the innocent Vietnamese family as well. Amid the supplies on the boat, Chef finds a puppy. Lance harshly takes it from Chef and keeps it as a pet. When Chef finds one young woman alive, Willard coldly shoots her to prevent any further delay of his mission. Tension arises between Chief and Willard from this moment on as Willard believes himself to be in command of the PBR, while Chief prioritizes other objectives over Willard's secret mission.Another night later, the crew reaches the chaos of the Do Lung bridge under attack. Willard learns from a courier that the missing commanding officer, Captain Colby (Scott Glenn), was sent on an earlier mission to kill Kurtz. Willard also sees the lost side of the war: burned-out, stoned soldiers fighting a battle they are losing to keep the bridge open. As the PBR crew leave, the bridge is once again destroyed by enemy shellfire.Lance and Chef are continually under the influence of drugs. Lance in particular smears his face with camouflage paint and becomes withdrawn. The next day the boat is fired upon by an unseen enemy in the trees, killing Mr. Clean and making Chief even more hostile toward Willard.Another day or two later, the PBR is ambushed again, this time by Montagnard warriors as they cross the border into Cambodia, they return fire despite Willard's objections that the arrows fired on them aren't lethal. Chief is impaled with a spear and tries to kill Willard by trying to pull him onto the spearhead before dying.Afterward, Willard confides in the two surviving crew members, Chef and Lance, about the mission and they reluctantly agree to continue upriver, where they find the banks littered with mutilated bodies. Arriving at Kurtz's outpost at last, Willard takes Lance with him to the village, leaving Chef behind with orders to call an airstrike on the village if they do not return.In the camp, the soldiers are met by an American freelance photographer (Dennis Hopper), who manically praises Kurtz's genius. As they proceed, Willard and Lance see corpses and severed heads scattered about the temple that serves as Kurtz's living quarters and encounter Colby, who seems catatonic. Willard is bound and brought before Kurtz in the darkened temple, where Kurtz derides him as an ""errand boy"". Meanwhile, Chef prepares to call in the airstrike but is kidnapped. Later imprisoned, Willard screams helplessly as Kurtz drops Chef's severed head into his lap.After some time, Willard is released and given the freedom of the compound. In another monologue sequence, the shadowy Kurtz lectures him on his theories of war, humanity and civilization while praising the ruthlessness and dedication of the Viet Cong: Kurtz had reached his breaking point some years before when he'd led a mission to inoculate the children of a small village for polio. Soon after completing that mission, Kurtz' unit was called back by one of the villagers where he found that the Viet Cong had come and hacked off every child's arm that had been injected with the vaccine. Kurtz morbidly admires the vicious dedication of the Viet Cong and the will they had to foil the efforts of his unit to help the villagers. Kurtz believed that if he'd had a large legion of men who would go to such extremes that he could end the war itself. Near the end of their time together, Kurtz discusses his son and asks that Willard tell his son everything about him in the event of his death.That night, as the villagers ceremonially slaughter a water buffalo, Willard enters Kurtz's chamber as Kurtz is making a tape recording, and attacks him with a machete. Lying mortally wounded on the ground, Kurtz whispers his final words ""The horror ... the horror ..."" before dying. Willard discovers substantial typed work of Kurtz's writings (scrawled with ""Drop the bomb Exterminate them all!"") and takes it with him before exiting. Willard descends the stairs from Kurtz's chamber and drops his weapon. The villagers do likewise and allow Willard to take Lance by the hand and lead him to the boat. The two of them ride away in the PBR downstream to find help and safety as the Army tries to reach them on the short-wave radio. Willard turns off the radio. As Willard drives the boat away into the dark of the night jungle and in the pouring rain, the last words of Kurtz's ""the horror... the horror..."" echo in his mind."

tt0078841,"['Comedy', 'Drama']","Chance (Peter Sellers) is a middle-aged gardener who lives in the townhouse of a wealthy man in Washington D.C. Chance seems very simple-minded and has lived in the house his entire life, tending the garden, with virtually no contact with the outside world. His cultural and social education is derived entirely from what he watches on the television sets provided by the ""Old Man,"" who raised him. The only other person in his life is Louise, the maid who cooks his meals and looks upon him as nothing more than a child who has failed to grow up. When his benefactor dies, Chance is visited by attorneys handling the estate. Chance tells them that he has lived his whole life inside the house. He was apparently abandoned as a baby and left in a basket outside the front door where the ""Old Man"" lived, who took him in and raised him. The lawyers force him to leave the townhouse and he discovers the outside world for the first time.Chance wanders aimlessly through a wintry and busy Washington dressed in conservative, old-fashioned business attire, a homburg hat, suitcase, umbrella and a television remote from his former home. Although finely-tailored many years ago, his clothes are of the style which has now come back into fashion, and so others presume he is an expensively well-dressed man of means.That evening, as he wanders, Chance happens upon a TV store. He sees his own image in one of the TVs captured by a camera in the shop window. While watching himself he backs into the street and is struck by a car owned by Ben Rand (Melvyn Douglas), a wealthy businessman. Rand's wife Eve (Shirley MacLaine), who is inside the limo, invites Chance to their home to recover from his injured leg. After being offered alcohol for the first time in his life, Chance coughs after he is asked his name. He says, ""Chance the Gardener"", but due to his cough those listening interpret his name to be ""Chauncey Gardiner.""During dinner at the Rands' home, Chance describes the attorneys coming to his former house and shutting it down where he lived his whole life after the death of ""the Old Man"". Judging by his appearance and overall demeanor, Ben Rand automatically assumes that Chauncey is an upper class, well-to-do, highly-educated business man. Although Chance is really describing being kicked out of the home where he tended to the garden after the death of his legal guardian, Ben Rand perceives it as attorneys shutting down Chance's business because of financial problems after the death of his long-term boss and mentor ""the Old Man"".Ben even assumes it must have been caused by ""kid lawyers from the SEC,"" obviously attributing it to have occurred at a higher, more sophisticated level than a tax/IRS problem, as most persons would likely have assumed. Sympathizing with him, Ben Rand takes Chance under his wing. Chance's personal style and seemingly conservative and insightful ways embody many qualities that Ben admires. His simplistic, serious-sounding utterances, which mostly concern the garden, are interpreted by virtually everyone as allegorical statements of deep wisdom and knowledge regarding business matters and the current state of the economy in America.Ben Rand is also the confidant and adviser of the U.S. President (Jack Warden), whom he introduces to ""Chauncey."" Chance's remarks about how the garden changes with the seasons are interpreted by the President as economic and political advice, relating to his concerns about the mid-term unpopularity that many administrations face while in office. Chance, as Chauncey Gardiner, quickly rises to national public attention. He becomes a media celebrity and appears on a national television talk show. He rapidly joins the A-list of the most wanted in Washington society. Public opinion polls start to reflect just how much his ""simple brand of wisdom"" resonates with the jaded American public. At an upscale Washington cocktail lounge, two important, older, well-dressed men are discussing Chauncey; one says to the other, there is a rumor ""he holds degrees in medicine as well as law."" Rand, dying of aplastic anemia, encourages his wife to become close to Chance, knowing Eve is a fragile woman.Rand's doctor (Richard A. Dysart) makes a few inquiries of his own. Even after acquiring Chance's fingerprints and a photo of him, the physician can't find a record of him anywhere, including elementary, middle, or high schools, colleges, nor employment or a police record. Rand's doctor concludes that Chance is actually a simpleton gardener, totally oblivious and unaware to the ways of the world. But he sees that Chance has helped Rand to accept his final illness and pending death. The doctor is hesitant to say anything that will upset Rand. He also sees that Chance possesses no guile, no intent to deceive, or any interest which would adversely impact Ben or Eve, or have any adverse effect upon Eve, or the estate, following Ben's death.Just days before his death, Rand amends his will to include Chauncey. At his funeral, the President gives a long-winded speech full of bon mots and quotes by Rand. Rand's pallbearers, all influential citizens and members of the board of Rand's several companies, hold a whispered discussion over potential replacements for the President in the next term of office. As Rand's coffin is about to be interred in the family Masonic pyramid-like mausoleum, they unanimously agree on ""Chauncey Gardiner.""Chance, oblivious to all this, wanders away from the funeral and through Rand's wintry estate. Ever the gardener, he straightens out a pine sapling and then walks up to the edge of a pond and then onto its surface. He pauses, dips his umbrella deeply into the water next to him, and then continues to walk further out into the pond. Rand's quote ""Life is a state of mind"" is stated in voiceover ."

tt0078869,"['Action', 'SciFi']","In the year 2130, the deep space research ship USS Palomino is on a search for intelligent non-human life on other planets. The crew is comprised of Captain Dan Holland (Robert Forster), Lt. Charles Pizer - the hotshot first officer (Joseph Bottoms); utility droid LF#396, informally known as VINCENT (voice of Roddy McDowall); Dr. Alex Durant (Anthony Perkins) - navigator and science officer; Dr. Kate McCrae (Yvette Mimieux) - medical officer and empath, who maintains a telepathic rapport with VINCENT via her ESP; and embedded journalist Harry Booth (Ernest Borgnine). After five years of fruitless searching, the Palomino is now on her way home for a refit when VINCENT notices a large, swirling blue accretion disk and recommends a course correction. VINCENT identifies the disk as a black hole, the largest discovered in recent history.While the crew nervously discuss the destructive potential of black holes, VINCENT reveals something else: an apparently derelict ship standing off from the black hole's event horizon (line of no return) and somehow able to remain stationary when it almost certainly should have been sucked in. Pizer and Booth are more shocked to see a ship so far from home (when the Palomino should have been the first spaceship to reach this deep in space) than they are to see the black hole. VINCENT identifies the ship as USS Cygnus, with the German scientist Hans Reinhardt (Maximilian Schell) commanding, which disappeared nearly 20 years earlier after failing to heed recall orders after its mission, the same as Palomino's, was declared a failure. (In addition, Booth remembers Reinhardt as arrogant, pompous, and utterly heedless of the value of taxpayers' money.) The Cygnus, however, holds another significance for the crew of Palomino: its XO, Frank McCrae, is Kate's father.Against his better judgment, Holland accepts the recommendations of Pizer and Durant and comes about to rendezvous with Cygnus. As they approach, they come under the influence of the black hole's tremendous gravity. But at their closest approach, the gravity ceases. Durant speculates that something from the Cygnus is responsible, but no one aboard can decide what that might be. The Palomino suddenly falls away from Cygnus and is very nearly sucked into the black hole. Palomino escapes but is badly damaged and now needs spare parts. So when Palomino once again comes under the protective influence of Cygnus, the crew start to look for a way to board--when suddenly Cygnus blazes with light, as if to welcome them.Palomino docks with Cygnus, and the crew, except for Lt. Pizer, disembark. They enter a vestibule, where automatic laser fire destroys their guns and knocks out VINCENT -- he is not seriously damaged, but his combat protocols are now offline. Holland radios Pizer, telling them they have been disarmed, but uninjured, before the crew moves forward. Then they board an automatic cart, part of a ship-wide transportation system, and ride in comfort to Cygnus' conning tower. They ride a hoist to the tower cab, which they find occupied by a crew of ""humanoids"" with hooded robes and mirrored faceplates. Though the humanoids ignore them, they do get the attention of an oxblood-colored levitating war machine who wordlessly challenges VINCENT to a face-off. Before the two robots can go into combat, Dr. Reinhardt emerges from the shadows and orders them to stand down. He identifies the war machine as Maximilian, his cybernetic master-at-arms.Reinhardt says that he is the only human aboard. Cygnus was disabled by a meteor storm, he and Frank McCrae stayed behind to make repairs while the rest of the crew left Cygnus in an attempt to reach Earth, never to be seen again. The elder McCrae has since passed on. He also admits, or rather avows, that he refused to obey his recall orders because he proposes to reconnoiter the black hole--and pilot his ship ""in, through, and beyond"" it, to another dimension that he is sure exists.Their conversation is interrupted when a squad of armored ""sentry robots"" brings in Pizer under arrest. Reinhardt smooths the situation over and then offers to provide spare parts for the Palomino. Pizer and VINCENT take charge of requisitioning the parts they need, and they meet LF#28, informally known as BOB, (voice of Slim Pickens), an old rusted sanitation droid who has languished since the human crew's disappearance.A little later, Holland happens upon several of the humanoids conducting what looks like a funeral for one of their own. He also finds crew quarters still containing furnishings and uniforms, a finding totally inconsistent with a wholesale abandonment of the ship. Elsewhere, Booth discovers the ship's on-board garden--which is as big as a jungle and easily ""big enough to feed an army,"" and notes that its mute groundskeeper is sporting a notable limp. The crew of Palomino reassemble to discuss what they have seen--and while Holland very much wants to accept the spare parts and depart from Cygnus as rapidly as possible, Durant and McCrae are curious about Reinhardt's black-hole reconnaissance plans. Reinhardt launches an experimental probe-ship to reconnoiter the black hole's event horizon, then invites the Palomino crew to a dinner party, where he will explain his research.While Reinhardt entertains the Palomino crew in his spacious, Victorian-inspired dining hall, VINCENT hangs out in a shooting gallery with BOB and several sentry robots, led by their prototype, Captain STAR. BOB explains that STAR had been the master-at-arms until Reinhardt built Maximilian, and is also responsible for much of the abuse BOB has endured over the years. STAR challenges BOB to a shooting match, and wins only because he had distracted BOB by bumping him as he was shooting. BOB then confesses that he let STAR win on purpose, to avoid retaliation. Outraged, VINCENT challenges STAR to a match. Though STAR again cheats, VINCENT still manages to beat him, and STAR is so angered by his defeat that he ends up literally blowing a fuse. BOB, impressed, asks VINCENT to meet him in the parts-storage bay.Inside the dining hall, Reinhardt is eagerly discussing his research with his new guests. Eventually, Maximilian notifies him that the probe-ship has returned, and Reinhardt excuses himself to debrief the pilot. After he has left, Holland and Booth discuss the inconsistencies they have discovered in Reinhardt's story. Holland and Booth are now convinced that Reinhardt is insane, but Durant wants to give him the benefit of the doubt.Now able to speak freely, BOB restores VINCENT's combat protocols to 100%, and tells him the real story: the humanoids are not robots at all, but are in fact the crew of Cygnus, reduced to drone-like mentality by a series of laser prefrontal lobotomies. As the two robots are reconnoitering the sick bay where some maintenance lobotomies are taking place, two sentry robots discover them. VINCENT and BOB destroy them and hide the evidence. They then rejoin Holland, Pizer, and Booth, who have returned to Palomino while Durant and McCrae have remained in the conning tower cab with Reinhardt. BOB tells the three men what really happened to the crew: that when the recall order was refused, Frank McCrae attempted to relieve Reinhardt of his command. Reinhardt accused Mr. McCrae of mutiny and then killed him. He then had his sentry robots capture the rest of the crew and subject them to the prefrontal lobotomies that have turned them into ""humanoid robots."" Meanwhile, Reinhardt and Maximilian discover the remains of the two sentry robots BOB and VINCENT were forced to destroy, and decide that it is now time to ""liquidate"" their guests.Holland orders VINCENT to use his ESP to contact McCrae and order her to return to Palomino with or without Durant, and to ""tell her why."" With that result, McCrae tells Durant that Reinhardt is a murderer, and that the apparent robots who are running the tower-cab systems are really the original crew. Durant removes the faceplate from a crewman, revealing his human face beneath. McCrae is nauseated at the sight-- Maximilian suddenly breaks off from his post and summarily executes Durant. Reinhardt scolds Maximilian, who nevertheless returns to his post. Reinhardt then appeals to McCrae to somehow ""protect him from Maximilian""--whereupon McCrae denounces him to his face and says, ""If there is any justice at all, the black hole will be your grave!""As a rejoinder, Reinhardt orders McCrae taken by force to sick bay to be lobotomized. Aboard the Palomino, VINCENT tells Holland that Durant is dead and McCrae is being taken to sick bay. Holland, VINCENT, and BOB then rush to the Cygnus' sick bay, rescue McCrae, and destroy half a platoon of sentry robots in a pitched battle, to the horror of Reinhardt, who watches on a video monitor. Reinhardt orders the sentry robots to terminate any unauthorized humanoids on that section of the ship, then instructs Maximilian to let Palomino take off and then destroy it at a distance with the Cygnus laser cannons, while he continues to prepare to dive into the black hole.When the allotted time passes, Booth is eager to write off Holland and McCrae as dead and leave. Pizer refuses, insisting on a rescue attempt. Succumbing to cowardice, Booth feigns an injury so that Pizer will let him return to the ship. Holland, McCrae, and the droids find themselves pinned down by sentry robots as they get closer to the Palomino, but Pizer, armed with twin pistols, manages to outflank the attackers. Booth then tries to take off in the Palomino alone. Endangering the Cygnus and himself due to his poor piloting skills, he nearly hits the conning tower before Cygnus' laser cannons shoot him down-- Palomino then crashes into Cygnus in a near-miss that causes some minor, but critical, damage. The Palomino crew now have only one avenue of escape: the probe-ship.As the Cygnus gets closer to the accretion disk, it is pulverized by a hailstorm of meteors, severely compromising its hull and taking its emergency reactors and null gravity generators offline. The Palomino survivors must dodge a large, red-hot meteor that crashes into the ship and traverses the entire main corridor, and pass through the ship's garden after it, too, is breached, all the while dodging and battling sentry robots.In the conning tower cab, the humanoid crew receive alarming signs that the ship is now subject to structural overload. Reinhardt orders Maximilian to prepare the probe-ship for launch. As Maximilian starts to leave, a seven-foot video monitor tears loose from its fastenings and crashes to the deck, pinning Reinhardt beneath it. In a hint of the poetic justice that he will eventually receive, Reinhardt cries out for help, first to Maximilian, who apparently deserts him to make his/its own escape in the probe-ship, and then to his lobotomized crew, who of course cannot understand him.Maximilian reaches the probe-ship docking hoist first and ambushes the surviving Palmonino crew. After BOB is taken offline and Pizer is knocked out, VINCENT attacks Maximilian, giving Holland, Pizer, and McCrae time to board the probe-ship. VINCENT and Maximilian fight using every gadget at their disposal, culminating with Maximilian catching VINCENT in a bear hug-like grab and attempting to electocute him. VINCENT responds by using his cutting armatures to disable Maximilian's antigravity stabilizers, which sends him spinning out of control through a hull breach and into the black hole.BOB, too weak to function any longer, says his goodbyes to VINCENT, who then reluctantly abandons BOB and boards the probe-ship. Holland lifts off as the Cygnus, now twisted into a lump beyond all recognition, is caught up in the whirlwind of stellar detritus that surrounds the black hole. Holland tries to set a course away from the black hole, but nothing responds. VINCENT soon realizes that the ship has been programmed to follow the course that Reinhardt had set for it: a straight dive down the vortex funnel of the black hole. Unable to alter that course, the three humans decide to ""pray that Reinhardt was a genius.""The probe-ship takes its straight dive down the black-red vortex and into the black hole. As it does, the crew start to hear voices--Reinhardt's and their own--repeating words spoken long ago, an effect of the tremendous time dilation as space-time is bent.Suddenly the viewpoint shifts to Reinhardt, floating out of control in the reddish vortex of the black hole in the same pose that he assumed when the seven-foot monitor in the tower cab crushed him. Then he catches up with Maximilian--or rather, Maximilian, who has been waiting for him, now takes him in an unbreakable embrace and draws him closer--until Reinhardt becomes Maximilian, which the viewer realizes because Maximilian's charged-coupler optical device is now a simple visor, out of which Reinhardt's frightened eyes suddenly stare. Worse yet, Reinhardt/Maximilian finds himself standing on a basalt promontory over a fire-covered craggy landscape, accompanied by his lobotomized crew. As the view withdraws from Reinhardt/Maximilian and pans down and then forward to show Cygnus' crew and then the fiery lake behind them, the viewer realizes that they are all, quite simply, in hell.Then a church-window-shaped portal opens, and the viewpoint rushes through it and through an arched corridor, through which a robed figure, arms outstretched, floats past the viewer and forward. Next, the viewpoint picks up on the probe-ship, now heading toward the viewer and out of a nebula-like star. Aboard, Holland, Pizer, McCrae, and VINCENT awaken from an apparent trance and realize that they are headed toward a bright light in space--not the harsh, lethal light of a star, but a very pleasant, warm light. They sit back and let the probe ship take them toward the light--which is apparently a white hole: the portal of heaven. The so-called four survivors of the USS Palomino have put the black hole behind them forever."

While out on deck, Alec sees a handsome black Arabian stallion being forced into its pen above decks by some cruel men, using a bullwhip to get the frightened animal into its quarters. Returning to his father's card game, Alec takes some sugar cubes from the coffee tray & brings them to the stall where the horse is tied up. Placing them on the railing of the door, Alec then hides from sight. Within minutes the animal has taken the cubes. As Alec turns around he is grabbed & roughly accosted by the mean-looking owner of the horse, who shouts menacingly in a foreign language before letting him go. Alec quickly returns to his cabin.That night, Alec's father shows him his winnings from the card game. Alec receives a pocketknife and a small carving of a horse. His father tells him the horse is Bucephalus, the horse of Alexander the Great. Alec puts the Bucephalus carving on a shelf and falls asleep.Later that night, the carving is illuminated with a bright orange light. The ship pitches violently and Alec is thrown from his bunk onto the cabin floor. Grabbing the carving & his pocketknife, Alec gets to his feet and his dad throws a lifejacket over him. As the two of them stagger out into the hall they discover frightened passengers fleeing their rooms. Alec's dad sees water pouring in through a door, and they make their way onto the deck. As Alec looks up he sees the superstructure of the ship blazing with fire. His dad leaves him below with instructions to hang on to a rail, and goes to the boat deck. As Alec stays put he hears the horse in its pen, and decides to set the animal free and give him his chance to fight for life. Fighting his way to the door, he gets it open, but is attacked again by the horse's owner who cuts the lifejacket from Alec's body with a knife. Seeing this, Alec's dad leaps onto the man from the upper deck & throws him against the rail. In seconds the man has disappeared. The horse breaks the ropes holding him in & charges out onto the deck.Alec watches helplessly as the horse jumps the railing & into the water. A wave then washes over the ship, sending Alec backwards into the railing. Suddenly the railing gives way & Alec plummets into the water, helpless. Hearing the stallion and seeing its head above the water, its ropes caught in the propeller, Alec swims over & cuts the rope, freeing the stallion. He and the horse swim clear as the Drake, ablaze with fire, goes down by the head - taking everyone but Alec & the horse.The following day Alec finds himself washed up on a remote island, apparently the only human survivor of the sinking of the Drake. Still carrying the Bucephalus carving & his knife, Alec starts trying to figure out how to survive. Finding a cave, he makes a fire and starts catching fish. He eventually discovers he is not alone - the horse has also survived, and is trapped with its ropes caught on some rocks. At first the frightened animal is wary of Alec, but he gets close enough to cut the ropes and free the horse, which shakes off the ropes & flees. Alec follows the horse's tracks, but they vanish in the sand.Later, asleep on a beach, Alec is visited by an uninvited guest; an Asp Cobra. As Alec comes to he sees the reptile hissing, its hood spread, ready to strike. Alec, frozen with fear, tries to back away, but the snake hisses more aggressively. Suddenly, the horse appears, and pounds its sharp hooves on the cobra, killing the reptile. Again the horse vanishes as quickly as it appeared.More and more, Alec begins to encounter the beautiful horse, and the two of them forge a strong bond, with Alec feeding the animal and bringing it fresh water, with the horse allowing Alec to ride him bareback. The bond between the boy & the horse becomes so entwined that when a rescue boat finds Alec, he refuses to leave without his beloved animal, and the horse refuses to let Alec go. The men on the rescue boat tether the horse and help the animal to a larger ship, and Alec & the horse - who he names 'The Black' - are on their way home to America.Back home in the midwest U.S.A., Alec's mother is enormously relieved her son is alive but also grieving the loss of her husband, and expresses her thanks to The Black for saving Alec's life by allowing Alec to keep the horse in their backyard. Unfortunately, one day as the garbage collectors are coming round, a hat on the man's head triggers a fear in the Black's mind, and the animal is racing through the streets. Alec goes after the horse, and follows its trail to a barn owned by Henry Dailey - a former jockey & horse trainer. Alec inquires about learning to ride the Black, but Dailey is at first skeptical - no papers exist, and he's considered a wild stallion. However, Dailey agrees to teach Alec the ways of riding.The two of them, along with the Black, undergo frequent, rigorous training in riding and saddling a horse. At first the Black is reluctant to allow a saddle but eventually becomes used to it, and soon Alec & the Black are making runs on a racetrack.While at a movie theater, Alec sees an ad about an upcoming horse race, featuring two of the most famous horses & jockeys in the United States. Dailey gets in contact with a reporter who comes to watch Alec & The Black on the track one stormy night, and he writes a story on it - leading to a challenge match between The Black & the two Thoroughbreds. The Black is billed as a 'Mystery Horse' challenging the Thoroughbreds. Soon, promotions about the upcoming challenge are sprouting up everywhere, and even Alec's mother takes notice.Eventually Alec reveals the truth to his mother; the Black is the 'Mystery Horse' challenging the others, and Alec will be riding him. At first Alec's mother refuses, fearing the worst after losing her husband. After talking with Henry and Alec again, though, Alec reveals the carving of Bucephalus and how he got it - and when. His mother relents & allows Alec to ride the Black in the challenge.On race day, Alec suits up with Henry, and the other jockeys are stunned to find a rider half their size as their opponent. They smugly sneer that Alec won't be able to control a horse the size of the Black.As they come out and prepare to enter the gates, one of the horses rears up and start kicking at the Black's feet. The Black defends himself, but it takes some effort to get the horses under control. The Black suffers a bloody wound to his lower front leg. The three horses finally make it into the starting gate.Inside the starting gate, Alec looks down and sees the bloody wound to the Black's leg. As the gates open, Alec tries to restrain the Black, fearing that running would aggravate the wound. The Black is slowed, but after a few seconds shows Alec that he wants to race. Although far behind, the Black picks up speed and begins to close the gap on the other two horses. As the three horses exit the last turn and head down the home stretch, Alec and the Black pass the first horse - then the second - and seconds later Alec & the Black are across the finish line, triumphant. Alec waves his hands in the air & Henry and Alec's mother cheer wildly from the stands. The Black's leg is bandaged, and Alec & the Black proudly pose for the cameras with their winnings. The film ends showing Alec & the Black in their times alone, on the island."

Picking up a book that she dropped, Dave chases her on his bike, and outside the girl's sorority house, he returns the book. Dave introduces himself as ""Enrico,"" an Italian exchange student, and she tells him her name is Katherine (Robyn Douglass).One day, Dave receives a cycling journal in the mail and learns that Team Cinzano, the Italian cyclists, will hold a race in nearby Indianapolis. As Dave rides through town, Cyril runs alongside him, and they discuss a college entrance exam Dave is supposed to take, though he admits he doesn't want to go back to school.One night, Dave stands outside Katherine's sorority and serenades her in Italian while Cyril plays his guitar. Inside the sorority, Katherine's friend Suzy (Pamela Jane Soles) calls Katherine's current boyfriend, Rod (Hart Bocher), to alert him. Meanwhile, Evelyn and Ray have a romantic dinner at home, listening to Italian music. When Dave finishes his song, Katherine rides off with him, leaving Cyril behind. Rod and his friends pull up and run after Cyril, believing he was the one who serenaded Rod's girlfriend. Later, Dave and Katherine return, and she kisses him goodnight.The next day, Mike sees Cyril's bruises and demands to know what happened, but Cyril remains silent about the incident. Determined to find the culprit, Mike drives to campus where Cyril identifies Rod, who is driving around with a new girl. Rod calls Mike and his friends ""Cutters,"" a local word for townies. Spotting Rod's car later that night, Mike, Cyril, and Moocher search for Rod inside a dining hall where Dave and Katherine are having a date. Mike and Rod start a brawl, and police arrive to break it up.Rod and his friends gather before a college administrator who suggests they resolve their conflict with the local residents in a more dignified manner and announces that this year's Little 500 bicycle race will welcome one team comprised of four non-students.At the quarry, Dave says he does not want to race in the Little 500, but Mike encourages him, suggesting that they will have a proper team if all four participate. On the other side of the quarry, Rod shows up with friends, and he and Mike engage in an impromptu swimming contest until Mike cuts his head on a rock. Afterward, Moocher and Dave walk through town, and Moocher announces that he's going to marry his girlfriend, Nancy (Amy Wright). He then meets Nancy at the courthouse to apply for a marriage license.Riding his bicycle through a red light, Dave almost collides with his father who is leading a test drive. Ray's vehicle stalls and later must be towed, costing him the sale. The next evening, Evelyn suggests that Ray give Dave a job, and, despite his resistance, Ray hires Dave to wash the cars on the lot. When a customer attempts to return a car, citing a 90-day guarantee Ray promised, Dave encourages his father to honor his word, but Ray refuses. He then suffers a heart attack.At home, as a doctor tends to Ray in bed, Dave tells his mother he will not compete in the upcoming bicycle race against the Italians, but Evelyn urges him to race despite Ray's condition.At the Cinzano 100 race, Dave gets a slow start but eventually catches up to the Italian team, who later cheats by shifting Dave's gear and sticking a pole through his wheel, causing him to fall and injure himself. At home, Dave greets Ray and Evelyn without an Italian accent. When Ray asks about the race, Dave cries and hugs his father.On campus, Dave admits to Katherine that he lied about being Italian, and she reacts by slapping him and storming off.At night, Ray asks Dave to join him for a walk. They discuss Dave's future, and Dave admits he is scared to go to college. Ray recalls his days working as a lowly stone cutter, and urges his son to aim for higher goals.One day, Dave's friends present him with an old Roadmaster bicycle, the only make allowed in the Little 500. Though Dave remains unenthusiastic, his passion is reignited when Mike expresses doubt about their chances of winning. Dave takes the bike home and fixes it. In town, he runs into Katherine, and she wishes him luck, saying that she will soon leave for a job in Chicago, Illinois.On the day of the Little 500, Dave and his friends wear shirts provided by Evelyn, with the team name ""Cutters"" across their chests. Though Dave gains a strong lead early in the race, he collides with another rider and sustains an injury. Moocher, Cyril, and Mike take turns riding while Dave receives medical attention. Listening to the race on the radio, Ray leaves work to join Evelyn in the crowd. When Dave sees his father there, he is inspired to get back into the race. Tied with Rod's team on the final lap, Dave pulls ahead at the last minute and wins the race.In the final scene some time later, Ray rides a bicycle through campus and says hello to Dave, now a student, who has just met a charming French girl."
tt0078908,"['Horror', 'SciFi']","At the Somafree Institute, Dr. Hal Raglan humiliates his patient Mike by saying: ""you're just a weak person. You must have got that from your mother. It probably would have been better for you if you had been born a girl!"" On the dimly lit stage, Raglan demands a demonstration of anger, and Mike reveals angry red blotches covering his torso. The audience gasps. Raglan announces that this is psychoplasmcis; the physical manifestation of mental rage by the appearance of the welts on one's body.Meanwhile, Frank Carveth collects his nine-year-old daughter Candy from a 'Private Guest Room'. Candy wears a red coat with fur trim and hood. Bathing her, Frank finds bruises and scratches on her back. He drives to the Somafree Institute to confront Raglan and demands to see his wife Nola, whom has been committed there after she apparently suffered a nervous breakdown. Raglan refuses. Frank accuses Nola of abusing their daughter and says he will stop Candy's next visit. Raglan threatens legal action if Frank withholds a vital part of Nola's treatment. Frank then goes to his lawyer, Al Resnikoff, who tells him that Nola has a stronger legal position despite the fact that she is committed to a mental hospital. Frank says that he will do what he has to. He takes Candy to her maternal grandmother, Juliana, who seems highly strung out.Back at the institute, Raglan goes into Nola's room (play-acting as Candy) and he asks her why she hurt her daughter Candice. Raglan/Candice says: ""Mummies don't hurt their own children"". Nola sobs that they do. She tells Raglan that her own mother was ""fucked up and bad"". Raglan encourages her anger by telling her: ""Go all the way through it, right to the end.""That evening at Juliana's house, she investigates a noise in the kitchen. Food, juice, glasses and dishes are thrown all over the floor. She is bludgeoned by what appears to be a small child wearing a red hooded raincoat with fur trim. As Candy watches from behind a door, small claw-like hands leaves bloodstains on the banisters. The next morning at his workplace, Frank is informed of Juliana's murder. Police psychologist Dr. Birkin tells Frank so encourage Candy to remember what happened, a breakdown is possible if she doesn't remember. ""These things tend to express themselves in one way or another"" says Dr. Birkin.At the institute, Raglan speaks to Nola as her father. She quickly gets very angry saying: ""You shouldn't have walked way when she hit me."" Red welts appear on Nola's forehead as she speaks.At the local airport, Frank and Candy meet Barton Kelly, Nola's estranged father, who has come for his ex-wife's funeral. On Resnikoff's advice, Frank visits Jan Hartog, an ex-Somafree patient taking legal action against Dr. Raglan. Uncovering a row of tumors on his neck, Hartog says bitterly: ""Raglan encourages my body to revolt against me. And it did. I have a small revolution on my hands and I'm not putting it down very successfully.""Back at the institute, a drunk Barton Kelly arrives and is furious when Raglan will not allow him to see Nola. Meanwhile, Frank arrives at Candy's school where her teacher, Ruth Mayer, sits with her. Candy invites Ruth to dinner at her house. That evening, Ruth arrives and has dinner with Frank and Candy. A little later, Barton calls Frank from Juliana's house, saying he needs Frank's help to see Nola. Frank leaves Ruth babysitting Candy, who picks up a book to read which is titled 'The Shape Of Rage'. Raglan's book on Psychoplasmics.At Juliana's house, Barton is alone when the same small figure wearing the hooded red raincoat emerges from under his bed and batters him to a very gory death with a pair of paperweights. Frank arrives a few minutes later and finds the body. The strange-looking ""child"" jumps on him like some aggressive animal, clawing at him until it suddenly falls off his back to the floor and seemingly dies. Frank picks up the phone to call the police. Back at Frank's house, Ruth Mayer answers a phone call from Nola calling from the institute, who then goes in a berserk rage when Ruth answers the phone and suspects that she is having an affair with her husband.At the police station, Frank gives his statement and then meets the pathologist who performed the autopsy on the mysterious 'child creature' that attacked him where the doctor tells him that the creature died simply because: ""it ran out of gas"". Or more likely ""its batteries expired"". The pathologist points out that the creature has strange eyes, no sexual organs, and no navel. ""This creature has never really been born... at least not the way human beings are born"" says the pathologist.Raglan (as Ruth Mayer) speaks to Nola, Raglan/Ruth says that Frank will divorce Nola and marry her. The jealous Nola screams to leave Frank alone. When Frank gets home from the police station, Ruth leaves in a hurry. He finds Candy cowering in a corner of her bedroom after a nightmare. He tells her that the 'thing' is dead.The next morning, Raglan reads about Barton Kelly's murder. Taking a gun from his desk, he instructs his assistant, Chris, to get all the patients out of the institute. Meanwhile, Frank visits the hospital where Mike is now a fellow patient of Hartog's and is told that Nola is in fact the only patient at Somafree. Mike becomes angry about being dumped by his ""daddy"", his face becomes one giant red sore.Frank takes Candy to school. In Ruth Mayer's art class, two 'children creatures' in pastel coats with hoods pick up wooden hammers and beat Ruth mercilessly to a gory death. Alerted by a boy's cries for help, Frank enters the classroom to find Ruth dead, and Candy gone.At the institute, Raglan wakes Nola. She relates a dream that Candy was coming back to her, and says she doesn't feel threatened by Ruth Mayer any more. At the same time, Candy is being led along a snowy highway by the two creatures.That evening, Mike turns up on Frank's doorstep raving about: ""the disturbed kids in the work shed. The ones your wife's taking care of."" Frank drives to the Somafree Institute where outside Raglan pulls a gun on him, saying they'll kill him if he tries to take Candy away from them. In a long monologue, Raglan tells Frank that the child creatures that have been doing all the killing are Nola's children. ""Nola is not their surrogate mother, she's their real mother."" They are the Brood; the parthenogenesis 'children' of Nola's rage. Over the past year-and-a-half Nola's psychoplasmics have manifested into these children which carry out her bidding whenever she's in an angry mood. Raglan tells Frank that Candy is locked up in the attic where the Brood are being kept, and that if he wants Candy back, Frank must go to Nola to convince her that he wants Candy back to live with him. If he can do that, the Brood will be neutral so Raglan can go into the attic and take Candy, if not... the Brood will attack as long as Nola is in a rage.While Raglan waits outside the attic door where the Brood are being kept, Frank goes to Nola's room. He finds Nola rocking back and forth, wearing a white robe bathed in light. Nola wakes from her trance-like state and seems happy that he has come to see her. Frank says that he wants to be back with her. (Note: throughout the entire movie, Nola is only shown from the chest up which is apparently to hide something). At this point, Nola throws back her white robe, revealing an umbilical cord and external sac on her abdomen. The years of the welts that have appeared on her chest have merged together to create this womb outside her body as an incubator for the Brood that she produces. Frank recoils in horror and disgust.In the attic, Raglan quietly enters where all the sleeping Brood lie in their bunk beds. He finds Candy in one and picks her up to carry her out. Just then, the Brood stirs, sensing Nola's mounting anger.In Nola's room, she tears open the sac, removing a bloody 'infant' which she licks clean, as an animal might after having given birth. Frank's true feelings towards all this become apparent to Nola and her rage erupts.In the attic, the Brood finally become active, leaping on Raglan, who manages to shoot a few of them, but he gets overwhelmed and beaten to death by the Brood. In Nola's room, she angrily tells Frank that she would see Candy die then let him take her away. Upstairs, the Brood then turn their attention to the petrified Candy who runs and locks herself in the closet room in the attic, but they break through the door to grab at her. Frank attacks Nola and strangles her to death with his bare hands to save Candy when he hears the noises coming from the attic. When Nola stops breathing, all is suddenly silent.Frank goes upstairs to the attic to find all the Brood dead outside the room where Candy locked herself in, realizing that the Brood died without their mother's connection. Raglan is also dead nearby having been beaten to death and lying next to a few of the Brood he managed to kill before being overwhelmed. Candy is quivering in a corner of the room and Frank enters picks her up and tells her that he is taking her home. As Frank drives home with Candy, she seems to have withdrawn into a state of shock and cannot speak. Frank doesn't notice two raised lumps on her left arm... signs of her inner rage. The welts suggests that eventually like mother, like daughter..."

Back at the villa, Iris then breastfeeds Frank for erotic lactation comfort.During Anna's funeral, Frank injects Anna's body with an embalming fluid preservative so that he can dig her body up and be with her forever. Unbeknownst to Frank, a funeral home employee sees him making the injection and becomes suspicious.At night, Frank digs up Anna's body at the cemetery. On the ride home, Frank gets a flat tire and while changing it for the spare, picks up an American hitchhiker, named Jan (Lucia D'Elia). While smoking pot, she offers some to Frank who declines because he is driving. The female hitchhiker then passes out in the car as Frank arrives back at the villa. Taking Anna's dead body from the van, Frank, begins stuffing Anna in his workshop. (Note: there are very, VERY graphic scenes involving Frank's disemboweling of Anna, and his efforts to install glass eyes into her sockets. Plus, Frank picks out Anna's heart and takes a bite of it.)When the hitchhiker wakes up and spots Anna's corpse, she panics and a struggle ensues. Frank tortures her by ripping off some of her fingernails with a pair of pliers before choking her to death. When Frank is not satisfied, Iris tries to comfort him once more, this time by masturbating him. Assisted by Frank, Iris chops up the hitchhiker's corpse in a bathtub and pours acid to dissolve the flesh (another very gory and graphic scene). Frank then buries the pieces in a hole in the woods.A few days later, a jogger (Anna Cardini) twists her ankle around Frank's home and he invites her in. They have sex on his bed, until Frank can't resist showing off Anna's corpse right next to them. Once more a fight ensues. Frank bites her neck and eats a huge chunk of her flesh.

Startled, he immediately leaves.That night, Frank picks up a woman at a disco. Fortunately for her, Frank just sends her off due to the arrival of Anna's twin sister Elena (played by Cinzia Monreale in a dual role). She asks to stay a few days while she sorts out Anna's estate.At the climax, Elena faints on seeing Anna's corpse seated in a chair in the foyer, and Iris approaches her with a knife before Frank intervenes. Frank kills Iris, but not before she badly injures him by stabbing him in the groin and ripping his left eye out. Frank, while Elena remains unconscious, incinerates Anna's body in the furnace so he can be with Elena. The funeral home employee then returns to confront Frank and finds him badly injured near the furnace in his basement. Frank passes out and dies.The funeral home employee takes Elena, who he thinks is Anna's deceased body, and returns it to the funeral home where he places it in a coffin for burial. While he is sealing the coffin Elena awakens, pushes the coffin open, and lets out a blood curdling scream...."

Inside the local hangout, Duke's Vista del Mar, T.T. listens to the jukebox and introduces himself to the owner, Duke Slusarski (Seymour Cassel), explaining that he is in town to honor his late brother Phil, a jazz musician who dreamed of playing his trumpet by the ocean. Touched by T.T.s spiritual mission, Duke offers the young man a place to stay at his house, but Duke's daughter, Corky (Glynnis O'Connor), is upset about the visitor's intrusion, since she was hoping to spend more time with her father during her last month at the beach before she returns to college. The next morning, Corky and T.T.s interaction begins awkwardly as she undresses in the bathroom to shower, not realizing he is using the toilet.At the local auto shop, Jordy Banks (Todd Susman), a local wealthy snob, shows off his shiny Corvette to local diner waitress Corrine (Alice Playten) and her boyfriend, Earl Fescue (Ned Wynn), the garage's mechanic.

Eloísa bate la comida y también le pone la comida al perro, y deja todos los cacharros en el fregadero para fregar más tarde. Mientras los perros comen, Eloísa se corta las uñas de los pies y se pinta las uñas; Bernardo toca el piano y se pone una de las cremas del perro en el pie. a Eloísa eso le parece asqueroso, pero él le dice que si a Dany le viene bien, a él también le funcionará.Más tarde, con todo desordenado, Dany se pone a alisquear la ropa interior usada de Eloísa. Eloísa y Bernardo se están vistiendo para ir a visitar a la tía Lina. Bernardo no quiere cambiar la hora de la visita, pero tampoco quiere ir a verla. Eloísa comenta que necesitan el dinero de Lina para vivir. Eloísa detecta un parásito en Dany, y Bernardo se lo quita con unas pinzas de depilar.

Cuando se acalora, Lina se agobia y no da respirado. Tienen una cuidadora, Marta (Isabel Heredia), que le pone un respirador en la boca. Bernardo no se cree nada: él siempre recuerda a tía Lina medio enferma.De vuelta a casa, conduciendo por la noche, Bernardo se para en mitad de la carretera para llamar a un perro abandonado. Una vez en casa, Eloísa ve la tele en cama, abrazada al caniche. Bernardo está disecando a un animal, y afuera se oyen aullar a unos perros.Bernardo no aparece al día siguiente. Eloísa le pone el colirio en el ojo al perro, y tiene que limpiar el sitio donde el caniche se ha meado. Saca carne de la nevera y se la va dando a comer a trocitos. Bernardo sigue limpiando la piscina, ahora medio vacía, y para ello usa un cuadro viejo.En el cine, Bernardo y Eloísa ven una película en la que aparecen muchos perros. Al acabar, un presentador habla de una nueva urbanización que está proyectada para que vivan perros. Dos ejecutivos (Carlos Martos y Miguel Avilés) intentan vender la idea a los inversores, gente que parece de clase media. A la salida, unas azafatas reparten panfletos. Eloísa estaría encantada de contribuir al proyecto, pero no tiene dinero. El veterinario, el doctor Alberto Agal (Cruz Tobar) pregunta a Eloísa por la salud de Dany, y le recomienda que le haga comer verduras, pero ella dice que no las traga.De regreso a casa, Eloísa y Bernardo tienen una bronca, porque ella les daría dinero para que llevasen a cabo el proyecto si lo tuviese, mientras que Bernardo piensa que todo son tonterías. En la bronca, se deduce que no son un matrimonio, sino hermanos, - nacidos de la misma madre. Bernardo se cabrea tanto que decide andar el resto del camino, a pesar del frío. Ve unos perros en una casa que le gruñen, y él se entretiene chasqueándoles los dedos, hasta que la gente de la casa se despierta y va a ver que pasa. Por el camino también se encuentra a unos perros abandonados que están comiendo los restos de la basura; improvisa un collar a uno de ellos y se lo lleva. Mientras Eloísa ya está en casa, calmando a Dany porque una tormenta ha estallado, Bernardo vuelve andando y se va empapando. Desde su ventana, Eloísa ve a Bernardo - que se protege con un plástico - y al nuevo perro. Bernardo tiene que tirar de él para hacerle andar. Se oye ladrar al nuevo perro, pero no se ve qué pasa. Mientras tanto, Eloísa se unta miel en su sexo y atrae a Dany hacia ella.Más tarde, Bernardo bebe, ya sin que se vea al nuevo perro, y mientras tanto, Eloísa está sientiendo placer sexual por las caricias de Dany, supuestamente al lamerle la miel. Bernardo oye sus gemidos y se mete en la habitación de al lado. Dany duerme con Eloísa, que lo abraza.Al día siguiente, Bernardo toca el piano mientras Eloísa le corta las uñas a Dany. Operan a la tía Lina de urgencia, aunque es difícil saber si se salvará. A Eloísa le asustan los cambios, pero su hermano sólo se preocupa de donde van a ir a cenar.Bernardo va a buscar a otro perro a un criadero o a la perrera municipal. Escoge lo que parece un mastín negro, y lo encierra en el maletero.Corte a un sacerdote (Buenaventura Martínez), que está bendiciendo al cuerpo de Lina, ya en un ataud. Durante la bendición, se oye los gemiditos que lanza Dany, a quien Eloísa ha colado en la iglesia metido en un bolso de mano.El agua de la piscina parece ahora más limpia; las cacerolas roñosas han dejado sitio a una olla exprés reluciente; la batidora es nueva y moderna; todo parece más limpio; la montaña de platos nuevos y relucientes, de porcelana, antes no estaba; Bernardo viste con un conjunto de pantalones cortos de tenis nuevos; hasta hay más cantidad de carne para Dany: se nota que han cobrado la herencia de la tía Lina. Vestida con un traje más elegante, Eloísa se mete en un coche recién comprado con elevalunas eléctrico. Eloísa deja a Dany sujeto a un palo en el jardín para que el cesped amortigüe el dolor de las patitas. Dany mete el perro dentro de la casa, donde se le escapa, ante la mirada del nuevo criado de la casa. Mientras va a buscarlo, Bernardo dice que a Dany no le gusta quedarse a solas con él.Como Bernardo tiene ahora su propio coche nuevo, coge a Dany y se van los dos. Sin embargo, le chilla, gritando que antes él estaba mejor y más cómodo. Bernardo dice que él también quiere a Eloísa, pero que ella lo prefiere a Dany. Tanto él como su hermana han ido a buscar más perros. Un domesticador alemán (Werner Delil) enseña lo muy educados que están sus perros. Carmen (Marta Molins) le prepara tres cachorros a Eloísa, mientras que su empleado (Francisco Rodríguez) se pregunta qué demonios hacen con tantos perros. La señora Carmen le dice que no haga preguntas.Eloísa lleva a los cachorritos a la cocina: dice a su hermano que no quiere perros de la perrera porque podrían pasarles cualquier enfermedad. Bernardo se ha comprado una caja de ritmos en lugar del viejo piano. Se supone que Eloísa mata y cocina a los perros. Esa tarde-noche, Alberto viene a cenar con ellos, invitado, y dice que Eloísa cada vez cocina mejor. Dany come con ellos a la mesa. Alberto les explica cómo va el proyecto en el que han invertido tanto dinero, pero Bernardo se levanta, diciendo que no tiene apetito y que no se encuentra bien. Ahora tienen hasta un pequeño cien en casa, y la nevera vuelve a estar abarrotada de carne cruda. Mientras los demás se quedan ablando en la sobremesa, Bernardo sale en la noche a la perrera a coger algún perro, y de hecho vuelve con un perro nuevo a casa.Al llegar, ve a Eloísa ofreciéndose a Alberto, y a éste meterle mano a ella, que al finay al cabo está mucho más arreglada y mejor vestida. Alberto se va, quedando con ellos al día siguiente a las 11 de la mañana. Después, los hermanos discuten. Eloísa quiere hacer una visita de obras con Alberto, pero Bernardo, cada vez bebiendo más, se niega a ir.

tt0078966,"['Drama', 'Thriller']","TV news reporter Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her freelance cameraman Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) visit the Ventana nuclear power plant outside Los Angeles as part of a series of news reports on energy production. Kimberly is an ambitious reporter who wants to become a ""hard news"" reporter, however, her superiors seem to be holding her back due to inexperience at reporting hard news and perhaps because she's a woman. As such, Kimberly reports stories of local interest that contain little substance.While watching the Ventana control room from an observation area with public relations officer, Bill Gibson, the plant goes through a reactor SCRAM, a temporary shutdown of part or all of the plant. Shift supervisor Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon), initially believing the SCRAM to be standard, notices what he believes to be an unusual vibration during the SCRAM. On the control console, a chart recorder indicates that the water level in the reactor core has risen to an abnormally high level. The crew begins opening relief valves in an effort to prevent too much water from damaging the plant, but the chart continues to indicate an off-scale level. Minutes later a crew member notices an alternate gauge on the control panel showing that the water level is dangerously low. Suspecting that the recorder pen may be stuck, Godell taps on the glass cover. He and crew chief Ted Spindler (Wilford Brimley) watch, sickened, as the pen trace rapidly drops to show that the water level is now mere inches away from exposing the reactor core, and still falling. The staff scrambles to close the relief valves and restore the coolant systems, but for several agonizing minutes no one knows whether the core is about to undergo a disastrous meltdown. Eventually, backup systems are able to slow and reverse the falling water level, and the reactor is brought under control.In the observation gallery looking over the control room, Richard, when told he was not permitted to film the control room for security reasons, has tucked the camera under his arm and surreptitiously films the incident. Because the glass is soundproof, the visitors can only guess as to what is happening, however, the panic of the crew is quite apparent, as is their relief when the danger has passed.When they return to the television station, excited about the event and the illegal footage they have of it, the station's news director, Don Jacovich (Peter Donat) after receiving a phone call from his superior, refuses to air the footage, citing federal law and fearing criminal prosecution from Ventana's parent company. Jacovich orders the film to be stored in the vault until the investigation of the accident is completed. Richard and Kimberly protest abut Jacovich refuses to allow the story.A day or two later Kimberly meets with Jacovich and Richard, who are arguing loudly over the official statement released by Ventana, which referred to the near-meltdown as an ""unexpected transient"", a term that makes no sense. Jacovich also explains the federal law that prevents them from broadcasting Richard's film, emphasizing that it's a felony to do so. Believing that there is more to the story than is indicated in the plant's official statement, Richard insults Jacovich and steals the film from the station vault. When she returns home, Kimberly finds a harsh message on her answering machine from Richard, who plainly believes Kimberly should have stood behind him.An official investigation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is held and each Ventana employee present at the SCRAM is interviewed for several hours. They are later exonerated by the NRC which concludes that while some errors by personnel were recorded, they still did their jobs adequately. Kimberley Wells travels to a bar near the plant where it's employees often go and meets Godell himself, celebrating the NRC's ruling with his fellow employees. She asks him a few hard line questions about the safety of the plant, however Godell tells her the plant is safe and that there are backup systems to handle problems like the recent event that took place. Kimberly notices that Godell seems a bit nervous about the plant's safety.Suspicious that there may be more errors to investigate, Jack dons a radiation suit and examines the defective water pump himself with a Geiger counter. He finds an area where nuclear material has leaked onto the floor. His supervisor, Herman, quickly orders a cleanup and tells Jack not to reveal the problem to anyone and to get the plant up and running. Jack does so with obvious reluctance and leaves work for the day.Godell does some investigating of his own and uncovers evidence that the plant is unsafe. Specifically, he finds evidence that the welds for the water pumps were not properly X-rayed to show their integrity. Godell concludes that another reactor SCRAM at full power could cause the cooling system to be severely damaged which would result in a catastrophic meltdown. Godell asks the plant foreman, Herman, to delay restarting the reactor but he refuses, under pressure from the plant's owners, who stand to lose millions of dollars each day the plant remains ""off line."" Herman orders Jack to get the plant up to full power again. A brief test is run to see if the repairs made to the water pump are secure. Jack watches the monitors closely and Herman deems the repairs to be adequate. Jack, looking distressed, has his crew follow standard procedure to bring the plant gradually up to full power.When he leaves for the day, Godell steals some of the damning x-ray films taken by the construction company that built the plant. At a construction site, he talks to one of the firm's officers, showing him the questionable x-ray. When Jack gets no satisfaction, he threatens to go to the NRC himself. The officer tells Jack that the firm has it's own security force that could be sent to harass or harm him.Kimberley talks to Richard's business partner, Hector, and finds out that Richard, who hasn't been heard from for several days, is at a convention of nuclear scientists in LA. She finds Richard there and he tells her he's showing the film to a couple of nuclear power experts; a physicist and an engineer. The two scientists determine that the plant very nearly went into meltdown, called the ""China Syndrome"" where the nuclear material heats beyond the capacity of the plant's personnel and safety systems to stop it. Reaching ground water under the plant, the material would explode into the atmosphere, rendering most of southern California radioactive and an uninhabitable wasteland for decades and possibly causing illnesses like cancer in the region's inhabitants. Kimberly and Richard both go to Godell's house and confront him directly, saying they know that Godell and his team narrowly avoided a meltdown. Godell, more nervous than he was before, tells them that he agrees with them and tells them about the false X-rays and the cost-cutting measures done by the contracting company. He also tells them that he was threatened by the firm if he goes to the NRC. Kimberly and Richard agree to keep Godell's identity anonymous if he can get them some of the incriminating evidence to present at the conference where Richard had talked to the two nuclear scientists.Richard arranges for Godell to meet Hector with a bundle of the x-ray film, but while Hector drives to the convention to deliver them, he's run off the road by security agents from the contracting firm. Kimberly calls Godell and asks him to speak directly to the convention committee himself. On the way there, he is chased by more hit men and is unable to join Kimberly. He's able to evade them for a few minutes but they catch up on the highway. He drives to Ventana, knowing the men following him won't be permitted past the plant's security gates.Godell rushes to the control room and finds the plant is nearly at full power. Now convinced of the evidence and unable to stop the power-up, he grabs a gun from the control room's security guard and forces everyone out. Once alone and secured inside the control room, he brings the power down to a safer level. He also tells the plant's managers that if anyone attempts to take control of the reactor from the outside or break in, he'll open valves and flood the containment building with radiation, which would render the plant unusable. He then demands to be interviewed by Wells on live television. Ventana's CEO, Evan McCormack (Richard Herd), speaks to Herman and Bill and allows them to tell the media to interview Jack.Kimberly arrives and is escorted into the control room. Godell tells her that he'll voice his concerns about the plant's safety on live television. Kimberly contacts Richard, who contacts every other major television network. In the hour it takes for them to arrive, the plant's parent McCormack orders Herman to find a way to cause a reactor SCRAM. The SCRAM, if plotted correctly, will distract Godell long enough for the rest of the team to seize control of the plant. After Richard leads the TV production teams into the same observation room he original filmed in, he misses seeing the SWAT team that arrives right after the news van to deal with Godell himself.Kimberly begins to interview Godell, who speaks frantically and makes little sense while explaining the more technical aspects of the recent accident. In the middle of the live interview, the SCRAM is started and the camera's cables are physically cut by the SWAT team. Godell begins to panic, rushing from one control panel to the next, trying to avert a catastrophe. The SWAT team suddenly bursts into the control room and shoots Godell. Kimberly tries desperately to help him, however, Godell, near death, tells her ""I can feel it..."" An ominous vibration, like the one Godell felt in the first incident, shakes the room. More alarms begin to sound and the SCRAM causes significant damage to the plant, as portions of the cooling system physically collapse. The reactor is eventually brought under control by the plant's automatic systems and by Spindler. When the incident ends, Kimberley sees that Godell has died.Outside the plant, a phalanx of reporters and television crews are awaiting word on the events inside. When the plant spokesman suggests that Godell was ""emotionally disturbed"" and that he ""had been drinking"", Kimberly Wells confronts the spokesman in front of the other reporters, and eventually gets one of Godell's co-workers, Ted Spindler, to admit that Godell would not have taken such drastic steps had there not been something dangerous about the plant. Ted tells the media that Godell was a hero for averting a disaster and that there will be a much deeper investigation this time. As Kimberly, obviously upset at Godell's death, gives her closing comments, the broadcast is cut off."
tt0079020,"['Documentary', 'Drama', 'Western']","[NOTE: This synopsis was written after multiple viewings of the online video at IMDB, 84 minutes, with an Italian sound track, which was tricky as I don't speak Italian.]The first sequence is a five minute documentary narrated by Grigori Aleksandrov. While relevant still photos are shown, we learn that in 1931, director Sergei M. Eisenstein, producer Grigori Aleksandrov and cinematographer Eduard Tisse came to USA for talks with Paramount, but no agreement resulted. This team was responsible for the successful prior films Battleship Potemkin and October. Some funding was arranged by writer Upton Sinclair, and the team went to Mexico to make a movie about its history and culture. With advice from Mexican intellectuals and artists, they traveled around Mexico and shot film. For a variety of financial and political reasons, Upton Sinclair deposited the film in Museum of Modern Art in New York for safekeeping. Eisenstein was never allowed to edit this movie. In 1979, the Soviet Union government retrieved the shot film and Grigori Aleksandrov prepared this version, using notes, sketches, and narration written by Eisenstein in addition to Aleksandrov's own recollections.The second sequence shows traces in 1931 Mexico of pre Columbian Mexico, first a montage of ancient sculptures and monuments, showing live persons whose appearance resembles the faces seen in the sculptures. Animals that appear in the sculptures, particularly birds and monkeys, are shown in their habitats. A burial ceremony appears to be quite ancient in concept. Next, there are shots of everyday life in a remote community where it seems that nothing has changed in several hundred years. The narration comments that the culture is matriarchal, with the women doing most of the daily work and selecting shelter and mates, and we see daily work and dwellings of pre-Columbian design.As we see relevant images, the narrator says that girls, starting in childhood, age about eight, work in order to save money to accumulate enough gold coins for a full necklace. When they have the full necklace, they are of marriageable age and select their own mate. Their wedding feast involves the entire village: the older matriarchs plan it, then there are costumes, food galore, dances and music. This sequence focuses on one such young woman, Concepción, her necklace, and wedding. The smiling couple is shown on a hammock, with a toddler, supposedly some years later.The third sequence, labeled FIESTA, shows details of an elaborate yearly festival in honor of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's patron saint. The narration says that these customs are a hybrid of pre Columbian elements with Spanish Catholic church teachings and traditions. Pilgrimages consist of walking on knees, sometimes real, sometimes simulated, up to the tops of hills where there are churches or shrines, many of them built precisely where pre Columbian pagan temples existed. Other male pilgrims tie their arms to Saguaro cactus beams that are carried horizontally on their shoulders as they represent Jesus on his way to his crucifixion. After the pilgrimages, there are celebrations with dances and prayers and parades. Catholic Church officials are the principal dignitaries. In the parades one can see many costumes and masks that clearly represent the Spanish Conquistadores, Cortez and his companions.The fourth sequence shows how deeply Mexicans have adopted the purely Spanish import of bullfighting as part of their own tradition. One bullfighting day in the life of a top level bullfighter is shown, beginning with his complex dressing up in costume, going to visit his mother to get her blessing, going to church to pray to the Virgin of the Macarena, patroness of bullfighters, the events and crowds at the bullring, the parade, the honoring of the Queen of the Corrida, the entrance of the bull and first sequence of passes, the picadores, the slaying of the bull, and the hats being thrown into the ring with money gifts inside the crown. The day for the bullfighter ends in a relaxing boat ride in a flower boat at the Floating Gardens of Xochimilco as he is surrounded and coddled by an admiring coterie of beauties.At this point a title card announces that we have seen Act I and Act II is next.The fifth sequence is entitled MAGUEY. The initial minutes are documentary, showing how the interior fluid of the maguey plant is harvested and transported on donkey backs to the principal buildings of a large plantation. Next, narration says we will see a dramatization of a local legend, events that supposedly happened during the years of the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz, when large plantation owners behaved in the fashion of medieval feudal lords.When one of the maguey field workers wanted a bride, on the day it was handed to him by her parents, it was a required custom that the bride had to be introduced to the plantation owners before she could live on the plantation. On this occasion, the bride strikes the fancy of the owner, the young man is distracted, taken away, beaten when he protests, as his bride is raped, and confined within the plantation.The fiancé, his brother and two friends want revenge, sneak into the plantation buildings to acquire an arsenal of rifles and bullets, and an armed rebellion starts. A complicated shootout ensues, the four laborers mainly on one hand, the plantation owner and his henchmen on the other. An interesting detail is that the daughter of the owner participates.At the end of the shootout, one of the rebels has been shot dead, the other three are captured, bound, buried in the ground with only shoulders and head above ground. The leaders go away and the underlings on horses trample the helpless rebels. The captive girl, now a widow, comes to see the corpse of her fiancé.The courage of the Indians in the defense of their honor, and the cruelty of the repression presage the revolution that the country needed.At this point in the film, Alexandrov reappears, to partially narrate, while historical photos are shown, a planned sequence SOLDADERA that was to depict the important role that camp following women had during the revolutionary civil war that followed the overthrow of Porfirio Díaz. This sequence was never filmed due to a cutoff in funding.A seventh sequence labeled EPILOG shows activities during the day of the dead. Families go on picnics to cemeteries and eat and drink over the tombs of dead relatives. Children are shown munching on chocolates shaped like coffins or eating candy goodies shaped and sized as human skulls. The attitude is to make fun of death. There are joyful dances where the dancers wear skull masks. Skull mask costumes are worn representing all the main characters of Mexican history, priests, politicians, conquistadores, etc.The last few clips show children and adults removing their masks to reveal smiling faces that symbolize the promising future of a modern Mexico."

tt0079083,"['Crime', 'Drama']","The Third Generation was once regarded as a highly controversial film in Germany. The Film opens in a high rise overlooking Berlin, Germany, as the sound of a heart beating and the T.V. are heard. Peter Lurz (Eddie Constantine), a well to do and established man in his 60s who sells computers, is looking out the window as his secretary Susanne Gast (Hanna Schygulla) is on the phone behind him. A man in his mid 50s wearing a putty colored trench coat and a hat, Officer Gerhard Gast (Hark Bohm), who's there to pick up Susanne, his daughter in law, engages in a conversation with Lurz. Officer Gast tells Lurz that he is being watched and is under police protection. In route of taking his daughter in-law home for dinner they both have a sexual experience at a hotel room. While having dinner with the whole family, Grandpa Gast (Claus Holm) tells the husband of Susanne, Edgar Gast (Udo Kier) that every generation needs a war. In all this we see visuals pop up of reported headlines of racial and hateful graffiti in public places. Susanne makes her rounds to other contacts. She approaches Hilde Kriger (Bulle Ogier), a school teacher, and tells her ""The world as will and idea,"" a common code phase that is used amongst the terrorist.
This is when sound takes the floor in this movie. Characters are introduced sporadically. August Brem (Volker Spengler) approaches Rudolf Mann (Harry Baer) in a record store where he works. The phrase ""the world as will and idea"" is spoken to him almost like a calling. Petra Vielhabor (Margrit Carstensen) who argues with her husband Hans (Jurgen Draegon) constantly gets the calling. During this time, when all of the characters are introduced, they are surrounded by noise from music, T.V. and radio. They are all extremely paranoid and tense. Their are to meet at Rudolf's apartment so they could meet Paul (Raul Grimenez), their so called leader of the terrorist group. While at the apartment they almost agree to kick out Ilse Hoffman (Y So Lo), a drug addict. They feel that she is a threat. August mentions it first to Rudolph who does nothing because he has compassion for her. Paul arrives and their so excited to see him for the first time. He makes forced arrangements to stay with Hilde in her apartment and rapes her. Two visitors come to see Ilse, Franz Walsch (Günther Kaufman) and Bernhard Von Stein (Vitus Zepichal). Franz is a long time friend and lover of Ilse. They decide to stay with her and help her drug problem. The others find books in Von Stein's suitcase and start tossing it around as Von Stein cries for it back. They act like children playing in a field.
Times are tense and get even worse when Paul is gunned down at a restaurant in front of Edgar who's faced by his father at the site. They are all afraid and decide to change their identity. August gives out paper squares to the group. Some have a mark and some don't. Petra, Rudolf and Hilde got the mark and had to break into the post office. Rudolph peed in his pants, he was so scared. The others laugh when they get back but not for long when Franz finds Ilse dead. Petra and some of the other terrorists rob the very bank that Petra's husband works in. While they are escaping, Petra shoots and kills her husband. They frantically change their looks and names and flee from their homes.
Von Stein is seriously interrogated by Officer Gast as to their whereabouts. Von Stein genuinely doesn't know but gets curious and follows August undetected. He sees Lurz give August money to fund terrorism at a Chinese restaurant. August sets up Franz by telling him where Ilse is buried. He then calls the authorities and gets him killed. August does the same to Petra when she is instructed to place a bomb and gets intercepted and killed by police. Von Stein is caught by Officer Gast at the cemetery when he tried to warn Franz that it was a setup and not to go to Ilse's grave.

tt0079095,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'R']","The film opens with a portrait of Adolf Hitler hanging on a brick wall. Suddenly an explosion blows a hole through the wall and inside is Maria Braun (Hanna Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch) about to get married. What is supposed to be a ceremonial and memorable moment for them has turned violent as bombs are going off around them. The setting is Berlin during World War II. As the ceremony is brought to a halt by the bombs, the Priest attempts to leave only to be stopped by Hermann. Separated for a brief moment as bombs continue to rain around them, Maria, Hermann, and Priest take cover on the ground and are finally able to sign their marriage license. After the opening of the credits, we see Marias mother eating a small piece of bread with a tiny drizzle of oil. The economic times are bad. Maria returns after being unable to sell off her wedding dress. However, she does not return empty handed. Amongst the things she brings back is a shaving brush. Then catching a photo of her husband Hermann, she begins to break into tears. Hermann has been sent to the front. With her mother cheering her up, they decide to cook up some potatoes with bacon.
With a poster hanging behind her back with the information of Hermann, Maria waits with anticipation at the train station, where the women wait for the men to arrive from the war. However, Hermann doesn't show up. Taking refuge in a soup kitchen, Maria talks to a woman working in the kitchen about the death of her husband in the war and remarriage. These are desperate times for everyone as several men dive for a cigarette butt thrown by a soldier. Heckled by a couple of American soldiers, Maria's strength is revealed as she confronts one of them, only to be given a packet of cigarettes. She decides to give it to her mother only in exchange for her brooch, which the mother agrees to. In the following scene, we see Maria once again roaming the city with the poster of Hermann hanging on her back. This time she is accompanied by her friend Betti Klenze (Elisabeth Trissenaar), who also has a poster of her husband Willy Klenze (Gottfried John) dangling on her back. Near the end of the day, they help each other put on heavy makeup in order to search for a job that their husbands might or might not approve. Maria believes that Hermann would have no qualms about her. On the following day, Maria meets up with a peddler (Rainer Werner Fassbinder) who trades a dress for her in return for Maria's brooch. She wears the elegant dress and manages to find a job as a waitress in a bar. Paying a visit to her childhood doctor (Claus Holm), she asks for a health certificate for her new employer. The following morning, she returns back to the train station and doesn't find Hermann. Giving up on her hope, she tears Hermann's photo off and tosses the poster board onto the train tracks. At her new job at the bar, she meets and shares a dance with Bill (George Eagles), an African-American soldier. Spending an afternoon in the woods, as Bill teaches Maria English, their relationship suddenly has become more passionate and intimate. In the next scene, we see Betti reunited with her husband Willy. However, he brings with him the news of Hermann's death. Maria returns and is shocked to find Willy back. Although ecstatic to have Willy back, Maria cries because her husband is not with her. Her only means of comfort now is in Bill. As Bill and Marias relationship begins to grow more intimate and close, she soon finds herself pregnant with his child. As they celebrate the announcement and preparing to make love, they are paid an unexpected visit. It is Hermann. As Bill and Hermann wrestle each other, Maria grabs a bottle and hits Bill across the head, which kills him. As the Americans put Maria on trial, Hermann takes responsibility and admits that he is the one who killed Bill. As Hermann is put in jail, Maria says that she will wait for him so that they can start a new life together. Furthermore, in spite of picturing their future with a new child, Maria tells her doctor that she is going to abort it. In the meantime, Maria focuses on attaining wealth. During a train ride, she meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny) in first class, a half-German, a half-French business who owns a factory in Germany. He has returned to restart it after enduring difficult times during the war. Changing to her more seductive dress, Maria strikes a conversation with him. However, her nonchalant and in different attitude ultimately attracts him. He also admires her firm demeanor as Maria is able to drive away a drunk and noisy American soldier from the train. As they share a car ride with Karls accountant Senkenberg (Hark Bohm), Karl decides to give her a job as his personal advisor. Later as she tells her family about her new position, Maria decides to move out of her mothers house in order to prepare for a future home with Hermann, much to the disagreement of those around her, especially Betti. Visiting Hermann in prison, she tells him that she is going to change thanks to this job. In one of her first duties as personal assistant, she becomes a translator for Karl and an English speaking customer. However, she doesn't translate faithfully in order to tell Karl what he wants to hear. As Karl and Senkenberg argue over whether or not the company can afford to buy three SE Machines, Maria asks for 30-minutes alone with the customer. In the scene that follows, Karl congratulates Maria with a toast for her contribution. However, Senkenberg remains skeptical as he would only drink in five years time of the company. As Karl reprimands Senkenberg for not being able to have fun, Maria jumps to his defense. We soon find Maria in bed with Karl. He even asks her to be with him over the weekend in the country. However, she tells him that she has to visit someone on the weekend. Maria though does not divulge the fact that she is going to visit her husband. As Karl tries to understand her and show her his affection, Maria shrugs it away. Instead, she chooses to talk about her salary as she tells him that she has to earn a lot of money over the next few years.

Soon after arriving, Frank is summoned to the office of the warden (Patrick McGoohan), who warns him that Alcatraz is unique within the U.S. prison system for its exceedingly high level of security. According to his file, Frank has an exceptional I.Q. and has absconded from other facilities, but the warden informs him that no inmate has ever successfully escaped from Alcatraz. During the conversation, the warden fails to notice that Frank has stolen one of the nail clippers on the desk. After being stripped search and given a dark blue prison uniform, Frank is escorted naked to his cell where one guard taunts him by saying ""Welcome to Alcatraz"".Over the next several days, Frank makes acquaintances with a few inmates among them are ""Litmus,"" (Frank Ronzio), a lifer who keeps a pet mouse, ""English,"" (Paul Benjamin) an African American man serving two life sentences for a double murder and the prison librarian, and Chester ""Doc"" Dalton (Roberts Blossom), an elderly man who paints portraits and once grew chrysanthemums at Alcatraz. However, Frank also encounters a bully named Wolf (Bruce M. Fischer), who harasses him in the showers and later attacks him in the prison yard with a shank. The guards break up the fight, and both men are sent to solitary confinement cells in D block, despite Frank merely acting in self-defense.Two weeks later, after being released from the brutal, isolated conditions, Frank settles into the routine of Alcatraz and a job in the carpentry shop and running books for English from the library. English commands deep respect in the prison yard, sitting high above the other inmates. When Frank approaches, English's friends try to stop him but English unexpectedly permits him to sit with him.Frank also befriends a new inmate in the adjoining cell, Charley Butts (Larry Hankin), in on a grand-theft auto charge that became a federal rap when he crossed state lines with the car. When the warden enters Doc's cell unannounced, he sees that doc has painted a very detailed portrait of the warden. At first the warden appears flattered but later he cruelly orders Doc's painting privileges to be eliminated without explanation. Devastated, Doc intentionally chops off three of his fingers in the carpentry shop with a hatchet. Frank and the other inmates soon learn that the warden found saw the portrait of himself among Doc's paintings and was responsible for ordering the sadistic penalty.In his cell one day, Frank sees a roach climb into the ventilator grill underneath the sink. Using the nail file he stole from the warden, he chips off a piece of the concrete around the opening. Along with brothers John and Clarence Anglin (Fred Ward and Jack Thibeau), who are Frank's friends from another prison sentence, and Charley, Frank plans an escape. Because the moist air and the salt water surrounding Alcatraz have softened the concrete foundation and corroded the metal over the last several decades, Frank thinks they can dig an opening around their ventilators large enough to crawl through and access the shaft leading to the roof.To mislead the guards during head counts, Frank suggests making papier-mâché dummy heads, using flesh-colored paint and hair from the barbershop. Since John works in the clothing shop, he can secure raincoats that can be combined with contact cement to make a raft and life preservers. Charley takes up painting to procure the colors needed to create the dummy heads and create cardboard coverings for the cell vents. Over the next several nights, as Charley keeps watch, Frank continues to scoop out his opening with the nail file and uses an accordion to disguise the hole. He later sneaks a spoon from the cafeteria and welds it to the file to provide a better grip for digging, a trick he learns from English using filings from a dime he gets from Litmus (who happily demands Franks desserts at chow time).Using a wedge he sneaks from the carpentry shop, he is able kick out the metal grill and takes his first peak into the shaft. Charley and the Anglins start to chisel their openings, while Frank creates his dummy head. When the decoy is finished, Frank lays the fake head on the cot as if he is sleeping and takes his first trip into the passageway. Initially the guard is fooled by the dummy, but later becomes suspicious when he notices that Frank has not moved. However, Frank miraculously returns to the cot before the decoy is exposed.The following day, Frank learns that the Anglin brothers are making progress on their openings and heads, but Charley is behind schedule. During the next trip into the passageway, John brings the raincoats and begins preparing the flotation devices. Meanwhile, Frank investigates the iron rods and hood blocking the exit to the roof and devises a makeshift drill from a small fan to remove their structural support. With the passageway clear and the rafts almost ready, Frank schedules the escape for Tuesday night, June 11, 1962.A few days later on the day of the planned escape, during mealtime, Frank places a chrysanthemum at the table in honor of Doc, but the warden stops by and crushes it, reminding Frank of regulations. Litmus is enraged, but as he reaches out to attack the warden, he suffers a fatal heart attack. Later, the warden requests a shakedown of Frank's cell and finds nothing unusual. However, when he hears that Frank and Charley stay up late conversing, he issues orders for the two inmates to be relocated to different cells as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Wolf has been released from solitary confinement and prepares to stab Frank with a knife, but English is able to intercept him.That night, Frank, John, Clarence and Charley plan to meet in the passageway and escape. However, Charley panics and fails to rendezvous with them. Carrying the flotation gear, Frank and the brothers access the roof and avoid the searchlights. From there, they scramble down the side of the building into the prison yard, climb over a barbed-wire fence and make their way to the shore of the island where they inflate the raft. The three men enter the water and begin kicking.The next day at dawn, a guard orders Frank to get up and prepare for relocation to a new cell. When there is no response, the guard slaps the head and it rolls on the floor. The alarm sounds and English smiles, knowing that Frank has escaped. As police search the area, there is no evidence to indicate whether or not the three inmates survived, but the warden does not want to blemish his perfect record and insists they drowned. On a rock by the shore, he finds a chrysanthemum and throws it in the water. The fates of Frank Clarence and Charley are left unknown even after an extensive investigation by the FBI."
tt0079219,"['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Drama']","Joe (George Burns), Al (Art Carney), and Willie (Lee Strasberg) are three senior citizens who share a small apartment in Astoria, Queens, New York City. They are three retirees who live off monthly social security checks and spend their summer days sitting on a bench in a nearby park, reading newspapers, feeding pigeons, and fending off obnoxious children.It is a dull life, and finally Joe is driven to suggest something radical to break the monotony. After making their monthly visit to their bank to cash and/or deposit their social security checks, out of the blue Joe asks them: ""why not go on a stick-up?"" Bored by their daily routine, Joe argues that the crime is not as risky as they may think. In the unlikely event that they are arrested, room and board will be free in prison and their social security checks will accumulate until they are released; and if they succeed, they will have extra cash to enjoy, instead of sitting on a park bench all day. Al likes the idea, but Willie is more skeptical. As they discuss details, Al offers to investigate the gun collection of his nephew, Pete, while Joe proposes that they scout a bank to rob in New York City.Al surreptitiously borrows some pistols from the collection of his nephew, Pete (Charles Hallahan) who lives just a few miles away with his wife and three obnoxious children, and whom are having money problems themselves. Pete tells Al that he wants to open up his own furniture store, but the stress of paying for their mortgage as well as utility bills is getting to all of them. Al decides to himself that the bank robbery will help his nephew out financially.The next day, the three men take the subway into the city and, without much deliberation, decide to hold up the Union Marine Bank at 36th Street and Broadway. As they indulge in hot dogs from a street vendor and participate in a sidewalk drum performance, the men are rejuvenated by the scheme. Al is confident that he can obtain the guns that afternoon, so the ringleader, Joe, suggests robbing the bank the next day.While Joe and Willie purchase three pairs of Groucho Marx-style glasses as disguises, Al stops by Pete's house. As soon as his nephew leaves for work, Al sneaks into the basement and takes three pistols from the gun case, as well as an assortment of bullets. The next morning, after finally determining which bullets fit the pistols, the threesome take a bus to another neighborhood in Queens to conceal their point of origin. From there, they hail an unlicensed cab, which does not keep records of fares. For $30, the driver agrees to take them into Manhattan and to wait outside the bank while they ""sign a will."" Upon entering the bank in disguise, Al detains the security guard at gunpoint, as Joe orders the teller to hand over the money. When the bank manager does not take the elderly men seriously, Joe fires a bullet at the wall, causing everyone to take cover on the floor. After filling their satchel with cash, the friends dash back to the waiting cab, ask the driver to drop them at a subway station and return to Queens on the train.When they count the money at home, the total amounts to just over $35,000, and Al suggest they hide the loot in his old suitcase, stored at Pete's house. Later, as the three men sit on their regular park bench and overhear a report on the radio about the crime, Willie suffers a heart attack and dies. Sparing no expense, Joe makes funeral arrangements.During the memorial service, Joe and Al decide to give $25,000 of the heist money to Pete, who tirelessly works two jobs to support his family. Pete is speechless as Joe explains that he and Al inherited a $25,000 life insurance policy from Willie, but they have no need for the money. In exchange for the gift, Joe suggests that Pete give them $20 per week to supplement their fixed income. After the funeral, the two friends decide to spend some of their money on a spontaneous vacation to Las Vegas, Nevada. Without making reservations, they take a cab to Kennedy Airport, buy a ticket, and board their first plane flight.At a casino hotel that evening, they try their luck at the craps table. Al is not familiar with the game, but Joe instructs him to simply roll the dice while he places bets. To their surprise, they accumulate $73,000 in winnings by the end of the evening. However, Joe realizes that their gambling luck will make them a target for thieves, as well as more conspicuous to authorities, so he suggests they collect the cash and fly back to New York that night.Arriving at their apartment exhausted from the whirlwind excursion, they immediately fall asleep. When Joe wakes, he hears a report on the radio that the police anticipate a development in the ""amateur"" bank robbery case. Joe tries to wake Al with the news, but is distressed to find that his friend has passed away. A few hours later that evening, Joe arrives at Pete's house, carrying the bag of money, and takes Pete aside to divulge the bank robbery, the Vegas winnings and his uncle's death. He adds that the police appear to be closing in and asks Pete to help hide the approximately $107,000 in a safety deposit box. Tearful over his uncle's death, Pete agrees and promises not to inform the authorities.The next day, Joe shaves and dresses for Al's funeral, but as he leaves the apartment, two FBI agents handcuff him and take him away. During questioning, Joe refuses to reveal the location of the money.Sometime later, Pete visits Joe at the state prison and reminds him that if he does not give back the robbery cash, he will receive a harsher sentence. Joe says he does not mind, adding that Al and Willie would not want him to return the loot. Joe explains that it no longer matters to him if he remains in prison for the rest of his life. For several years, Joe already felt like he was in prison with living a dull life. Joe explains that he no longer has to cook and clean for himself in prison. He gets three square meals a day, and generally is getting ""treated like a king around here."" Joe tells Pete not to visit him again to avoid being suspected in his bank robbery plan, and to ""enjoy his inheritance"" of living off the bank robbery and Vegas money. In the final shot, as Joe is being escorted back to his cell by a guard, he looks mischievously at Pete and says with a wiry smile: ""besides... no tin-horn joint like this could ever hold me!"""

When supervisor, Captain Geiberger (Ossie Davis), informs the group that the task force's funds are being suspended due to a low rate of convictions, the officers are frustrated. They argue that they apprehend plenty of the criminals, but the liberal judges release the outlaws. For the team's final weeks, the captain assigns police sergeant Louise Webster (Suzanne Pleshette) to the unit.After arresting Hymie (Sydney Lassick), the owner of a disreputable pawnshop, and two of his customers, for trafficking stolen goods, Doug conceives an idea for the task force to establish an undercover fencing operation. Using their remaining departmental budget, they can take over Hymie's shop, buy contraband, and catch thieves without searching for them, all without violating entrapment rules since the crime occurs before the arrest. Louise, who is experienced with surveillance, suggests videotaping the transactions, which will help ensure convictions in court. The captain is intrigued and obtains approval from the police chief, but on condition that Miami police will deny the scheme if the media finds out.As the first order of business, the team arranges for Hymie to take an extended vacation. Next, Louise sets up a hidden camera behind a two-way mirror to videotape customers at the counter. As a way of encouraging repeat business, Ernie and Doug pay top prices for stolen goods, while Ramon handles the accounts and keeps track of customer names and addresses. Furthermore, to enhance their reputation among criminal sellers, the team gives the impression of being members of organized crime.One night, three holdup men enter the shop pointing guns and steal all cash on hand, but the officers are unable to react because they do not want to expose the operation. After the incident, Ernie obtains a watchdog, named Jaws, who looks friendly, but happens to be a trained killer. The team buys a variety of stolen loot, ranging from harmonicas to chickens, and keeps track of the inventory in the back warehouse. Soon, a steady stream of petty thieves frequents the pawnshop.After the captain remarks that the customers should look more directly towards the camera, the team decorates the border of the two-way mirror with nude pictures of women. Unaware of the scheme, Lieutenant Kiley (Barney Martin) from the Miami Police Organized Crime Unit stops by and says he will investigate the shop unless he receives a weekly payment of $1,000. When he leaves, Louise is satisfied that she captured the corrupt officer on camera.Another day or two later, Florida mafia boss, Carmine (Marc Lawrence), arrives with two of his henchmen. He advises Ernie and Doug to cease claiming that they are part of the mafia ""family"" and orders them to shut down the business. Ernie declares they are members of a powerful out of state crime syndicate that is expanding, but Carmine remains suspicious and threatens to return.During a risky deal with weapons dealers, Doug and Ernie are taken by boat to a construction site and shown a truckload of machine guns for sale. They wear wires, while Louise and Ramon follow close behind and record the conversation. When the dealers demand immediate payment, Ernie and Doug reveal their police badges and weapons. A gunfight ensues, but the team finally outwits and apprehends the crooks.Back at the pawnshop, a boy delivers a dead fish, which Ernie interprets as a mafia death threat, and, later, the team is nearly the victim of a bomb that Carmine disguises in a Cuban cigar box. With their spending budget nearly exhausted and the warehouse stacked with stolen goods, the task force and the captain prepare to end the operation.To make arrests without arousing suspicion, they throw a party and invite all their criminal customers. During the festivities of food, drinks, and dancing, the captain plays the role of the team's mafia boss, and guests are required to walk through a metal detector before entering. As everyone is enjoying the party, Ernie announces to the crowd of petty thieves that he and his colleagues are police officers and everyone is under arrest, but the guests do not believe him and laugh. As he tries to convince the crowd, Carmine and his thugs barge into the party. Carmine declares that he will not tolerate encroachment into his territory, and Ernie and Doug are knocked to the ground. The action sparks a fight as the petty thieves enter the fracas. Screaming that he only has two days left until retirement, Ernie backs away from Carmine, who is pointing a gun at him, but the bullets miss, and Ernie is only soiled by ketchup. As Miami police units finally arrive on the scene, the petty thieves and the mafia men are divided into separate groups and transported to prison.Later, at Ernie's home, the captain reports to the task force that the operation resulted in 250 arrests and 231 convictions.

tt0079372,"['Action', 'Drama']","Jin bei tong opens with a group of escort/guards preparing to move a shipment of gold from the local government to an area stricken by famine. One of the guards informs the escort chief, Yang Hu Yun (Sun Chien) that two mercenary fighters named Yen and Fang, are ready for them on the road and will act as scouts. Yang Hu Yun says that the local governors are relying on them to make sure the gold reaches the famine-stricken area, as the people there need it desperately to obtain food. They are awaiting the arrival of a special government agent named Hai To, but he has not arrived yet.One of the guards suddenly comes rushing in, mortally wounded. On his back, in his own blood, are painted the characters for the party responsible for the killing-- the Che Sa gang, a ruthless group of bandits. Yang Hu Yun orders his men to notify Yen, Fang, and a swordsman named Li (Wei Pai) and his girlfriend, who will also be assisting with the gold escort. The Che Sa gang are sending the guards a message that they are after the gold and intend to steal it for themselves.Yang Hu Yun orders his men to prepare to move out. He warns everyone that their group, and the mercenary fighters who will be aiding them, are very powerful, but the Che Sa gang is as well, and are partcularly ruthless. They are led by four Chiefs.The opening credits begin with a montage that shows the fighting style of each Chief. Number 1, Golden Arm (Lo Meng), is muscular and stocky, a master of unarmed hand and arm techniques. Number 2, Silver Spear (Lu Feng), has an acrobatic fighting style and wields a specially crafted spear in battle, which appears to be sculpted out of a single piece of solid silver. Number 3, Iron Robe, wields a steel fan with razor edges in battle, and his robe is covered with iron studs that act as armor against sword-slashes. Number 4, Brass Head, fights unarmed and wears a brass plate over his forehead, which makes his head butts lethal.The Chiefs are ranked by skill, not age. All of them are relatively young, and Golden Arm is the youngest of them. Despite this, all of them are infamous for their success. has also heard that the Che Sa have recently acquired some mercenaries of their own... a group known as the Seven Hooks, who are known for their cruelty and viciousness.Yen and Fang are scouting ahead on the road. They encounter the Seven Hooks, so named for the hook-like weapons they wield. But Yen and Fang prove superior in their teamwork and use of the weapons they wield; Yen uses a heavy poleaxe, while Fang wields paired hand axes. This has given them the nickname of 'Longaxe and Short axe.' Yen and Fang kill all Seven of the Seven Hooks.Miss Leng (Helen Poon), Swordsman Li's girlfriend, is walking ahead on her own when she encounters Iron Robe. He questions her on why she has been sent ahead alone. Leng says nothing, only holding her sword at the ready. But Iron Robe says he will not attack women, and says that he is letting her pass. But Iron Robe quickly shows his true colors, as a few of the Che Sa grunts are waiting in ambush. They strike at Leng as she starts to move past, but she slays them with a quick sword-draw maneuver, calling Iron Robe despicable. Iron Robe is unrepentant, caring only about winning. Several more Che Sa grunts come out of hiding as Iron Robe himself engages Leng in battle.But Iron Robe's fan is pushed aside by a hurled wine jug. The owner of this jug (Kuo Chui) quickluy leaps out of nearby bushes to catch it. He complains, mostly to himself, about only having drank three jugs of wine so far, and he couldn't be drunk. Unamused and not caring about drunkenness, Iron Robe attacks the man, who fends him off and slays the henchmen using only the wine jug as a weapon. No sooner is Leng safe when the mysterious man who saved her leaps back into the bushes, leaving her once again alone.Yang Hu Yun is leading his main body of men with the wagon containing the gold. Several of the escort service's scouts report in to say that Yen and Fang have slain the Seven Hooks, and that Leng was ambushed by Iron Robe, when a mysterious drunken man rescued her and promptly disappeared. Yang is thoughtful for a moment and realizes that the man must be Hai To, the government agent they'd been awaiting. Hai To is a drunk, who regards wine as his only friend, and that he fights best when he's intoxicated. Thinking another brief moment, he signals to the wagon driver and the convoy begins moving again.Leng meets Li at a tavern in a small town that the escort convoy must pass through. He is concerned about her being late, and she tells him that Iron Robe ambushed her and nearly killed her. The two sit, and the tavernkeeper and the head waiter are seen looking at Leng and Li intently. The head waiter signals to a table attendant who begins to pour wine for them, but suddenly grabs a sword from behind another table. But Li has anticipated this, quickly slaying the waiter with a single lightning sword stroke. The tavernkeeper feigns ignorance, outraged at the killing, until Li produces the sword the waiter used to try and ambush him. Continuing to feign ignorance, the tavernkeeper castigates the head waiter, who was responsible for the conduct of the lesser attendants. But as this is going on, the tavernkeeper is stealthily passed a spear which he uses to attack Li and Leng. The tavernkeeper and head waiter are Silver Spear and Brass Head in disguise, and the other attendants are all Che Sa grunts. As a battle breaks out, Silver Spear is seen glancing at a man standing outside the tavern.Li and Leng fend off the grunts, slaying several in the process, but Li is slowly backed up against one of the tavern walls. When he is close enough, the hidden man outside bursts his hands through the walls of the tavern, striking Li in the back. The man's hands are covered with a sandy substance that have administered a contact poison to Li-- the Sand Palm. Li slays the Sand Palm but is wounded. He and Leng slay several more of the grunts and escape from the tavern. Silver Spear orders his men in pursuit.But the grunt at the head of the pursuit runs smack into Hai To, who blithely walks into the tavern and seats himself as if having no idea what is going on. He gestures to Brass Head and orders a jug of wine. Brass Head glances at Silver Spear, who gestures to the wine racks, directing Brass Head to bring Hai To a jar. Brass Head does so, and Hai To quickly begins to guzzle it down. Growing impatient, Brass Head attacks Hai To, who parries the attack with the wine jug, causing it to shatter against Brass Head's metal headdress, which is covered with a cloth one to hide it.Seemingly more annoyed at the wine jug being wasted, than anything else, Hai To nonetheless reveals Brass Head and Silver Spear for who they really are. Silver Spear, not recognizing Hai To but seeing that he is exceptionally skilled in combat, condescendingly offers him a place among the Che Sa gang. But Hai To presents some outrageous conditions, among them his being the Number 1 Chief and that all the grunts must be done away with. He starts to recite a third condition, but can't seem to remember what it is. Knowing he is simply taunting them, the remaining grunts attack Hai To, but he kills one and escapes from the others.On the road, Leng is begging Li to rest while she finds a doctor to help him. But Li refuses the offer. He says his internal body control can fend off the Sand Palm poison for at least two days, which should be enough time for the mission to be accomplished. Fearful of losing Li, Leng accuses him of only caring about his own heroism, but Li again counters, saying he is willing to die for the sake of both Yang Yu Jun and the famine victims, while Leng wants to save Li only out of her own love for him-- who then, he asks, is being selfish.The whole guard convoy is resting at the town. Several scouts report in to Yang Hu Yun. Many rival gangs know of the gold shipment, but none dare try to steal it because they all know that the Che Sa gang is pursuing it, and the other gangs, being no match for Che Sa, are afraid of trying to compete with them. Yen and Fang also have a prisoner, who they caught loitering around the area where the convoy is resting, and who they suspect of being a Che Sa member. They try to interrogate him, but the loiterer tells them to go ahead and kill him-- he is not afraid, and he knows that torture is against their morale code. Acknowledging that attempting to learn anything would be futile, Fang gives the loiterer a quick and clean death.A secret panel in the floor suddenly opens up and Brass Head emerges, attacking the guard convoy. Yang Hu Yun realizes that the panel conceals a hidden tunnel through which the Che Sa have spirited the gold chests back onto the wagon and are preparing to spirit it away. He orders his men to stop them, but more Che Sa arrive in force, engaging them all in battle. As Brass Head and the Che Sa grunts battle the guard convoy, Iron Robe climbs in the wagon and starts to drive it off. Hai To stealthily stows away on the wagon, clinging to its underside and axles. When Iron Robe is out of both sight and earshot of his reinforcements, Hai To breaks the rear axle of the wagon, bringing it to a standstill. Iron Robe quickly lights a signal flare. Hai To comes out of hiding and casually taunts Iron Robe about nobody answering the signal flare.But one of the Che Sa grunts, back in the town, has seen the flare, and hurries to inform Brass Head. He signals a full retreat, but Yen, Fang, Yang Hu Yun and the remaining guards cut Brass Head off and mortally wound him.The rear door to the meeting place is smashed open; Golden Arm has arrived. Brass Head tells Golden Arm that Iron Robe has driven the gold off, but has just sent up a signal flare. Golden Arm says he will go investigate, and then when the time is right, he will avenge Brass Head, killing all of the guard convoy. Brass Head expresses his gratitude for the promise before he dies.Golden Arm almost casually begins to walk toward the other exit to investigate the signal flare. All of the guard convoy attack him... but fighting unarmed, he fends all of them off, blocking every shot thrown at him; his bare arms stopping the slashes of swords and axes. He reaches the front exit completely unscathed and continues on his way. The guard convoy is in awe of Golden Arm's fighting ability. Yang mentions that Golden Arm never uses weapons, having proven that he does not need any; his arms are the only weapons he needs. He could have killed all of them then and there, but let them go-- for now-- because of the signal flare that Iron Robe sent up.And Iron Robe does have his hands full. He recognizes Hai To for who he is, knowing that only he would behave the way he is. Knowing that Hai To has arranged to catch him alone, he engages the agent in hand to hand combat. A group of Che Sa reinforcements arrive. Making quick work of them, Hai To seizes a spear to use as a weapon, but Iron Robe's metal-studded robe protects him from the spear's sharp point. But Hai To finally outwits Iron Robe, placing the wagon between them. Rather than allow Hai To to try and circle around for a rear attack, Iron Robe leaps over the wagon... but Hai To has gotten right under where he will land, bracing the butt of the spear on the ground with the point up, which gets under the metal-studded robe, dealing the third Che Sa chief a terrible death. Hai To quickly leaves the scene of the battle-- and the wagon-- after finishing Iron Robe and the last of his henchmen.Golden Arm arrives, surveying the scene. Speaking to himself, he knows that Swordsman Li is hurt, and Leng is with them. Yang, Yen and Fang, and the remaining guard convoy grunts, are not a problem. Only Agent Hai To could have caused this much trouble. Nonetheless, Golden Arm is unafraid, and looking forward to fighting him at the right time. Knowing he cannot fix the wagon and take it away on his own, Golden Arm decides to let Yang Yu Hun recover it and keep it a few more days. As Golden Arm walks off, he is unaware of Hai To lurking among the foliage, having eavesdropped on Golden Arm's monologue.Li encounters Silver Spear on the road. The two fight, and Silver Spear twirls his weapon around in a way that causes Li to become dizzy from the Sand Palm poison. Hai To arrives before Silver Spear can finish Li. Hai To and Silver Spear fight it out until Leng arrives, and Hai To warns Silver Spear to retreat, or Leng will be able to help finish him off. Knowing Hai To is right, Silver Spear withdraws. Hai To picks up the unconscious Li and carries him off, Leng following and yelling in protest.Hai To brings Li to a blacksmith forge where some acquaintances of his are working. He pays them some silver and they place Li into the forge, locking him inside. Leng, outraged, tries to attack Hai To, but he fends her off easily, telling her nothing. She is forced to stand outside and wait.The smith workers put more wood into the fire to feed it. Li comes to from the intense heat and tries to break out of the forge, but cannot. His fists hurting from the effort, he screams in anger and anguish.Scouts are reporting in to Yang Hu Yun, who is leading the wagon again. The scouts have checked ahead ten miles and have found a small town where they can rest. Yang Hu Yun agrees, but says the convoy will also rest where they are now, for a while.But this proves a deadly mistake, as the Che Sa have anticipated that the convoy would pass through the area, and have set booby-trap poison needles everywhere. All of the convoy guards who have leaned or sat near trees and bushes are dead. Yen sweeps the ground with his poleaxe and finds a near minefield of poison needles sticking out of the ground. He has everyone break pieces of wood directly off the wagon and nowhere else, to attach to the soles of their shoes. Everyone must move standing completely upright and must touch nothing, and lean against nothing.At the forge, Leng is vowing to exact vengeance on Hai To if it takes the rest of her days, and Hai To, guzzling wine again, simply laughs her off, saying he's right in front of her. Despite her anger, she is no match for him in combat and grows more and more frustrated.Inside the forge, Li has ripped off his tunic and shirt, to find that the intense heat has caused his body to drive out the Sand Palm poison through perspiration. He understands now that he was not placed into the forge to kill him or cremate his body... but to save his life. Hai To signals to the workers to open the forge, and Li emerges, alive and completely healthy again. As Leng marvels at this, Hai To leaves again... without paying the workers. He tells them it was Li they saved, they should hand him the bill.Golden Arm and Silver Spear confer at their headquarters. Silver Spear says that their poison needle traps have decimated a large number of the guard convoy, and when the convoy arrives at the next town to spend the night, the Che Sa will be ready. The convoy has sustained considerable losses, though the ones remaining are the toughest yet.Golden Arm grows thoughtful as he remembers fending off Yang's forces the previous night when Brass Head and Iron Robe were killed. He had had time to observe Yang Hu Yun's fighting style and is sure that he is not a skilled fighter... which makes no sense to Golden Arm because he is famous as a swordsman. A little over a year ago, on a different escort duty, he killed seventeen would-be bandits, using his sword, in a single battle.Silver Spear is unconcerned, feeling that Yang, like the rest of the guard service, will all be slain soon and the Che Sa will have the gold. Golden Arm concedes the point, and asks about rival gangs that might also try to get the gold for themselves. Silver spear says that all the other gangs are too scared of trying to compete against the Che Sa. Only one name is any cause of concern to either Golden Arm or Silver Spear... a fighter named Iron Feet, who was also renowned a short time ago, but simply disappeared shortly after Golden Arm formed the Che Sa gang.The guard convoy has arrived at the next town and is preparing to sleep for the night. It takes very little time before several more of the grunts fall prey to the next Che Sa trap... they have driven off or killed all the town's inhabitants and poisoned the water supply for miles around. They must consume only the food and water rations brought with them from the start, and be doubly alert on guard shifts throughout the night.Hai To arrives, guzzling wine from a jar as he is always doing. He knows the water has been poisoned, so he is fortunate he only drinks wine. He confers with Li and Yang, who understand that even the candles may be poisoned, so they are only using their own torches. But Hai To notes the iron bracket rings placed on the walls for holding the torches. He ushers everyone outside and pulls the windows shut just as the heat from the torches causes the bracket rings to release poison gas. Hai To notes that they will all have to sleep outside tonight, on the very streets of the town.Later at night, the Wang Brothers, two of the senior guards in the convoy, decide that they can't stay with the convoy because they're sure to die if they do. They make an agreement to sneak into the building where the gold chests are, steal whatever they can carry, and hurry off. But it turns out that even the chests, themselves, are coated with contact poison, which kills the two guards, and baffles the rest of the convoy, including Yang Hu Yun and even Hai To. The Che Sa couldn't have possibly known that any of the escort convoy was going to turn coat. And even if they somehow could have known, why place poison on the chests? Yang and Hai To wrestle over the possibility of a traitor in the escort service.The convoy leaves the town at dawn to get on the road. Hai To has already left. Silver Spear and his spearmen find Hai To at another tavern and quickly kill all its employees. Silver Spear tells Hai To that Golden Arm is offering him a deal: if he backs off from the convoy, they'll give him a 20% cut of the gold's value. Instead of answering, Hai To questions Silver Spear on the poisoning of the Wang Brothers. The blank look from Silver Spear, showing he doesn't know what Hai To is talking about, the answer Hai To expected.Silver Spear tells Hai To that if he doesn't accept Golden Arm's terms, then Golden Arm wants to settle with him, hand to hand, in a duel. Hai To asks for the time and place, and seems remarkably unconcerned. Silver Spear withdraws, but Hai To tells the spearmen grunts that they are under arrest, and kills them all.On the road, fear of the Che Sa has broken the morale of all the remaining convoy grunts. They approach Yang Hu Yun and tell him that they want to leave. Yang starts to pull his sword, but Li says to let them go. If they wish to run like cowards, it will catch up to them in time. The grunts are hurry off, and Li, Yen, and Fang are thoughtful. They understand the grunts losing morale, as all their co-workers and friends are dead. As for the three of them... their loyalty is to Yang, to the end.Yen and Fang go ahead on the road to scout, leaving Yang, Li and Leng with the wagon. Arriving at a clearing, Yen and Fang are thoughtful. The Che Sa must know that the convoy's strength is nearly broken, and Yen has also seen that Yang is barely competent as a fighter. He and Fang wonder if he is injured, but they are too mindful of his feelings to ask.The ambush that they are expecting strikes at that moment; a contingent of spearmen under Silver Spear. Separating Yen and Fang, Silver Spear takes Yen down with several thrown darts just after Yen finishes off all but one of the spearmen. Fang and Silver Spear fight it out until Silver Spear gets Fang in a grapple and the last spearman skewers Fang from behind. Breaking free of the grapple, Fang swings his axes over his head, killing the spearmen, and then, as Silver Spear is off-guard, Fang grabs the spearhead that is poking through his chest, and with his last breath, pulls the spear completely through his body and drives it into Silver Spear, taking the Che Sa Chief number two, with him.Yang Hu Yun, Li and Leng arrive at the site of the battle. That Yen and Fang managed to kill Silver Spear is small comfort in light of their also being lost. Only Yang, Li, Leng and Hai To remain... and Li thinks poorly of Hai To as an escort member. He stalks off alone, Leng realizing he probably is going to seek out and challenge Golden Arm.Hai To is leaving the tavern, hauling a small wagon loaded with wine jars. He happens across Li and tries to warn him from proceeding where he's headed. Li pays no attention.Hai goes to meet Yang and Leng on the road. Finding out about the loss of Yen and Fang, Hai To says that he was set to meet Golden Arm at Chi Li Hill, but he suspects that Li figured this out and has gone there himself. Leng is outraged that Hai To didn't try to stop Li, even though Hai To points out that if he tried, Li would fought to his own death trying to get through Hai To. Li's sense of duty and honor mean far more to him than anything, including Leng's love for him.Just as both Leng and Hai To predicted, Li finds his way to Chi Li Hill and challenges Golden Arm. The lead Che Sa chief sees no threat in Li, even allowing him to recover his sword after disarming him. Good as Li's swordsmanship is, Golden Arm's unarmed technique is better. The bare skin of his arms does not yield to the razor edges of Li's steel sword. Golden Arm finally tires of the bout and kills Li.Leng arrives in time to see Li struck down. Drawing her own sword, she starts to advance on Golden Arm, but she knows she cannot hope to take him and starts to backpedal when he advances on her in return. Golden Arm gives her three days to leave the area and give up her role in escorting the gold shipment. After that, if he sees her again, she admits defeat.As Golden Arm turns away, Leng notices a bamboo pole poking against her ear; it is Hai To, using the pole to discretely whisper to her without Golden Arm hearing. He tells her to leave the area and return in two hours, whereupon she will be set to take revenge for Li's death.Golden Arm meets up with Hai To. He tells Hai To that his men are giving Li an honorable burial, and that he gave Leng three days to run. Hai To is unafraid of his own death, shrugging it off as a risk of his work.Yang Hu Yun arrives with the gold wagon. He is now alone in escorting it. Seeing Golden Arm, he removes his cloak and draws his sword... in a manner that even Golden Arm, trained only in unarmed fighting technique, can see plainly that Yang barely knows how to use a sword, despite his fame as a swordsman. Hai To tells Golden Arm to forget about Yang. Golden Arm acknowledges and they begin their duel.Hai To and Golden Arm are almost evenly matched. They battle to a stalemate before Yang throws his sword to Hai To, who catches it and resumes the battle without missing a stride. Even Yang's sword has no effect on Golden Arm's arms, and he shatters the sword to pieces between his hands. Finally Hai To produces two metal hooks that prove to be attached to long chains. Getting Golden Arm's arms snared up in them, Hai To suddenly conforts and regurgitates a gullet full of wine, spewing it full force into Golden Arm's unprotected eyes.Golden Arm is blinded by the attack; the one part of his body that Hai To knew had to be vulnerable. With the leader of Che Sa incapacitated, it seems that the gold shipment is safe for the short distance remaining for it to be escorted.But it just seems that way. A man emerges from the interior of the wagon, having been in hiding there from the very beginning. He looks exactly like Yang Hu Yun (also played by Sun Chien) and wields an identical nine-ring broadsword. He strikes from behind, mortally wounding Hai To.Hai To quickly pieces everything together. Yang's double and the true leader of the escort service, is also the traitor from within. He can easily kill Golden Arm, pass him and Hai To off as having killed each other, and then kill his stand-in, and everyone will think that the remaining Che Sa gang members have the gold. Yang stares in horror as his employer gives him a wicked smile, before advancing and killing him with a swift sword-stroke.Hai To points out two weaknesses in the escort leader's plot. First, he didn't know about the contact poison on the chests, so he didn't have to kill the Wang Brothers. Also, his stand-in, although a near perfect resemblance to him, was not a competent swordsman, as the real Yang himself is famed as.But the escort leader says that his swordplay is no better than his stand-in's had been. What he IS extremely skilled at, however... is a fighting style that makes heavy use of kicking techniques. He is extremely good with his feet. The last piece of the puzzle falls into place as he reveals that he is the missing fighter Golden Arm had been concerned about... Yang is Iron Feet.Shortly before Golden Arm formed the Che Sa gang, he and Iron Feet had been equals. But after the gang was assembled, Iron Feet was sorely outnumbered and could not overcome them. He went into hiding, and began biding his time leading a crew of escort guards, waiting for a major job as this where he could finally see the Che Sa dismantled through attrition, kill Golden Arm, and turn coat, starting his own gang of outlaws. To hide his identity, Iron Feet even established a false reputation as a swordsman; the seventeen men he killed at a lake while on escort duty, died from his kung-fu kicks, and while the bodies were still warm, he then slashed them repeatedly with his sword so it would appear that he killed them with the sword. Nobody survived to tell the truth.To finish his plan, Iron Feet must also kill Golden Arm. Golden Arm knows that Iron Feet has no choice in this. Straining his ears to listen, he is able to fend off Iron Feet's attack and counter effectively. Iron Feet happens to notice Golden Arm's ears twitching, straining to listen. Iron Feet backs off, stepping very slowly and carefully to deaden the sound of his footfalls. This allows him to seize the advantage and land a number of punishing kicks.But before Iron Feet can finish Golden Arm, Hai To suddenly leaps into the fray. Iron Feet's sword slash never actually hurt Hai To... his wine flask stopped the blow. As he's always said, wine is his best friend. Iron Feet and Hai To battle it out until Hai To is able to knock Iron Feet back... right into a waiting Golden Arm, who lands a lethal blow from behind.Golden Arm is still blind, however. He is no longer effective as leader of a criminal gang. Seeing no other option, and in a sign of gratitude for Hai To showing mercy to him, he tells Hai To he will find his way to the next town to live out the rest of his days quietly.But Leng has returned, as Hai To has told her to, and she is ready to take her revenge. Coming up behind Golden Arm, she drives her sword through his back, the point crashing out through his chest. Acting on pure reflex, Golden Arm breaks off the front of Leng's sword, and she is in shock finding the bloody point at her own neck in a heartbeat.But Golden Arm chooses to spare her life. The clean death Leng has given him, in the end, is much better than the fate he had been facing. He tosses the broken piece of her sword aside and accepts his death.Hai To tells Leng that the famine-stricken area is close enough that she can reach it quickly. There are no further obstacles to her bringing the wagon safely there, even if she is alone. Bidding her farewell, he goes off to find more wine and get drunk. Jin Bei Tong closes with that simple note."
tt0079384,"['Comedy', 'contentRating', 'PG']","Bill (George Burns) is an elderly ex-vaudevillian performer who lives alone in a large, comfortable home. He awakens to a special alarm clock that activates his home stereo system, waking him to his favorite music. Along the way, Bill looks at photographs of his deceased wife, who apparently used to be part of his act. After breakfast, Bill goes to the supermarket, driving his unique classic automobile, a meticulously preserved 1930s model Pierce-Arrow; he compulsively takes two orange parking cones out of the trunk and places them in the two parking spaces next to his, to block anybody from parking near his car. Inside the market, Bill interacts in a friendly way with two employees, charming them with a magic trick.Kate (Brooke Shields) is a young teenage girl who is in a domestic squabble with an intimidating man named Demesta (William Russ). Kate, who is apparently nude and is wrapped in a towel, has locked herself in a bathroom to hide from Demesta, who pounds angrily on the door and demands to know the details of a drug deal that Kate has fouled up. He screams at her to give him either his money or his drugs. Frightened, Kate escapes through the bathroom window, still wrapped only in a towel, while a policeman suddenly knocks on the front door of the apartment and grapples with Demesta. The policeman chases Demesta down the street while Kate goes in a different direction, slipping down over a hillside staircase and losing her towel in the process. She runs away totally nude.Bill comes out of the grocery store talking to the bag boy about magic tricks, but when he opens his trunk to replace his orange parking cones, they both see Kate lying naked in his trunk, covered only in a deflated tire tube. Stunned and suddenly in a very compromising position (with a naked teenage girl in his trunk), Bill convinces the bag boy that it was just an illusion and he drives away. He stops on a secluded side street to question Kate, who asks Bill to take her to his house. He reluctantly agrees.Bill tries to get Kate to tell him what's going on, but she avoids all his questions, telling him crazy things like that her parents died on the Titanic and that she has no last name. Bill responds sarcastically to her jibes, but he also does his best to help Kate with whatever trouble she may be in. Instead of going to the police, he allows her to take shelter in his home, allowing her to choose some of his clothes to wear and even altering them so they fit her better. Kate refuses to answer any of his questions, and she attempts to escape Bill's house by dropping out of an upstairs window, spraining her ankle in the process. This attracts the attention of Bill's neighbors, Stan (John Schuck) and Sue (Andrea Howard), a nosy couple who try and figure out who the strange girl is at Bill's house.Bill goes to visit his friend Max (Burl Ives), who is a resident of a nursing home. Max apparently lived with Bill before being confined to the facility due to his despondent condition; Max has retreated into his mind and hasn't spoken a word in years, refusing to react to external stimulus. Bill still makes a habit of visiting him daily, cheerfully telling him about everything that's going on. He tells Max about Kate, saying that he feels as if he has to help her, although he doesn't know how. Later, Bill also receives a visit from his daughter, Shirl (Lorraine Gary) and her husband, Harris (Nicolas Coster). Shirl feels Bill is becoming senile and she tries to get him to sign a document that will give Shirl control over his bank account; when Bill refuses, Shirl becomes furious, complaining that Bill is giving away all of his money, but Bill angrily rebuffs her.Meanwhile, Demesta is in a rage about Kate's betrayal. He questions Roy (Christopher Knight), a teenage friend of Kate's, in an intimidating way and tells him that he'll find Kate wherever she is. When Bill goes to get a prescription for painkillers refilled, Demesta sees him in the pharmacy, but is unaware that he is connected to Kate.Stan and Sue step up their interfering and call Shirl to tell her they saw a young girl in Bill's house. When Shirl returns, she demands to see Kate but Bill refuses to let her in the house. He also refuses to acknowledge that he's harboring a juvenile, denying anything is wrong, much to Shirl's dismay and fury. Shirl suggests to Harris in a private moment that her father has been unstable ever since his vaudeville career went bad, identifying a disatrous show in Pittsburgh as the turning point. Harris thinks Shirl just misunderstands Bill, and encourages her to accept Bill's eccentric ways.Bill and Kate have a conversation where she reveals to him that she's on the run from a drug dealer. She claims Demesta gave her money to make a connection and pay for a cache of product, which she then threw into a sewer in a moment of panic. Bill tells her to go to the police, but Kate is afraid to do this because of the consequences for herself. Bill is happy that Kate has opened up to him finally; he genuinely likes her and feels that she has never had a nurturing home, being shuttled between foster homes. He invites her to come live with him, but Kate tells him that one has to be a certain age to be a foster parent. ""I'm not old enough?"" he jokes.Bill's poker buddies, whom he calls the ""No Shirt Gang"", all arrive to play cards at Bill's house, and he introduces Kate to them. They promise to be discreet about her presence, and the evening is interrupted when Shirl makes good on her promise to return with the police. The No Shirt gang hides Kate with a magic trick, levitating her up to the ceiling. When the girl can't be found, Shirl is even more furious.The next day, Bill leaves for his daily visit to Max, and he has a conversation with Kate, explaining Max's situation to her. Kate feels as if Max may need some tough love, recalling a young boy she once knew who also refused to talk. Kate tells Bill that the boy started talking once all the other kids ignored him. When Bill visits Max, he tells Max that he will never come to see him again; unless Max talks, it's goodbye forever. As a result, Max breaks down and begs Bill not to leave, and they embrace. Bill returns to the house excitedly to tell Kate the good news, but he finds that Kate is gone and the house is empty. Bill is despondent.Meanwhile, Kate returns to her foster home and gets a few of her belongings. She meets up with Roy at school, and Roy warns her that Demesta is looking for her.

Imagine a place so dark that even dreams are swallowed by its terrible darkness.Imagine a mining town, where the mines are as black and deep and exploited as the lives of the miners who go down it, forced to dig deeper and deeper by the wealthy, greedy owners who care for nothing but profit. So deep in fact that with each passing day, the bowels of the earth threaten to close over their heads in angers, so deep that every trip down the mines is a desperate gamble of life and death.But as the saying goes, where there's life, there's hope, even lives as grindingly grim as that of the miners . And hope comes to town as three men.Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) an ex-naval officer who is court-martialed and dismissed from the navy for his role in as captain of a ship that sank and many lives were lost. Vijay is looking for a place so dark that even the hideous demons inside him that taunt him so terribly will get scared and go away. He finds that darkness in the depths of the coal mines where he now works as a coal miner, where he welcomes every danger, every threatening rumble of disaster as a chance to pay for his past Ravi (Shashi Kapoor), the engineer in-charge of these doomed mines. Doomed because the greed and mindless exploitation by its owners have made the mines into potential death traps. Ravi, seeing the terrible danger looming ahead, tries to alert the management but with little use. He is paid for his alertness by being fired from his job which is when he joins forces with the workers and Vijay in order to save the lives of the minors and fight the establishment.Mangal (Shatrughan Sinha), an escaped convict who is also looking for a place to hide, but unlike Vijay, not from himself but from the eyes of the law.

From the trusting, simple miners and their families who see these men as messiahs and from three women. Sudha (Raakhee), a doctor who is as kind and caring as she is beautiful and sees Vijay's bleeding, repenting heart behind his stone-hard exterior, Anita (Parveen Babi) a reporter who falls in love with Ravi's fearless, clear-eyed belief in justice and in himself and Shanno (Neetu Singh), a gypsy whose sparkling eyes and racy sales pitch snares even the hardened heart of Mangal.Kaala Patthar, inspired by a real-life mining disaster, is an intensely dramatic film about the human heart. That as long as it beats with love and with hope, there will always be a dawn waiting at end of the blackest of nights.

After many months of unrest, Ted and Billy begin to cope with the situation and eventually grow to love and care for one another.Ted befriends his neighbor Margaret (Jane Alexander), who initially had counseled Joanna to leave Ted. Margaret is a fellow single parent and the two become kindred spirits. One day as the two sit in the park watching their children play, Billy falls off the jungle gym and severely cuts his face.

During the custody hearing, both Ted and Joanna are unprepared for the brutal character assassinations that their lawyers unleash on the other. For instance, Margaret is forced to confess that she advised Joanna to leave Ted if she was as unhappy as she professed, although she also attempts to tell Joanna on the stand that her husband has profoundly changed. Eventually, the damaging facts that Ted was fired because of his conflicting responsibilities with his son, forcing him to take a lower-paid job, come out in court, as do the details of Billy's accident.Finally, the court awards custody to Joanna, not so much due to the evidence on both sides but due to the assumption that a child is best raised by their mother.

While attending Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, he becomes attracted to a young female rebel, Judith. His desire for Judith and hatred for the Romans lead him to join the People's Front of Judea, one of many factious and bickering separatist movements, who spend more time fighting each other than the Romans.The group's cynical leader Reg gives Brian his first assignment as a rebel: an attempt at scrawling some graffiti (""Romanes eunt domus"", poorly translated Latin for ""Romans Go Home"") on the wall of the governor's palace. He is soon confronted by a passing Centurion who, in disgust at Brian's faulty Latin grammar, forces him to write out the grammatically correct message (""Romani ite domum"") one hundred times. The walls of the fortress are literally covered in text by dawn.When the Roman guards change shifts at daybreak, the new guards immediately try to arrest Brian. After a series of misadventures, the fugitive winds up in a motley group of mystics and prophets who harangue the passing crowd in a plaza. Forced to come up with something plausible in order to blend in, he babbles pseudo-religious nonsense which quickly attracts a small but intrigued audience. Once the Roman guards have left, Brian tries to put the episode behind him, but has unintentionally inspired a movement; and a crowd begins to follow him around, with even the slightest unusual occurrence being hailed as a ""miracle."" After slipping away from the mob (who are busy persecuting a ""heretic"") and spending the night with Judith, he discovers that an enormous crowd proclaiming him the Messiah has formed outside his Mother's house. Appalled, Brian is helpless to change the people's minds, as his every word and action are immediately seized as a point of doctrine.The Romans finally catch the hapless Brian and he is scheduled to be crucified. Pontius Pilate asks the crowd whom he should pardon, but is fed various ""fake"" names intended to highlight his strong lisp, much to the their amusement. Pilate eventually orders Brian's release, but in a moment parodying the climax of the film Spartacus, the various crucified people all claim to be ""Brian of Nazareth"", and the wrong man is released. Abandoned by anyone who might be able to help him, the actual Brian remains hanging in the hot sun, and is told by his fellow sufferers, in song, to ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life""."
tt0079475,"['Animation', 'Drama', 'Family', 'Romance']","An old artist (Rolf Harris) sets up some paintings at Luna Park, Sydney, planning to sell them, but has trouble attracting any people until he performs ""Jake the Peg"". Most of the crowd move on again when the performance finishes, being uninterested in his paintings, so he starts telling his granddaughter about their origins.We then travel back in time to a British convict ship, the ""Northern Star"", as it sails towards a tiny colony on Sydney Cove with sixty-four convicts on board. Six of these convicts are a young boy named Toby Nelson, his older sister Polly, ""Big George"" Tomkins, a blacksmith, Jake ""Dipper"" Davey, a professional pickpocket who had only been nabbed when he became old and slow, William Watts, a ""village idiot"" who was on board for stealing a pig from a farmer - he had been caught when he tried to sell the same pig to the same farmer on the same day, an action that led to him being nicknamed ""Silly Billy"" after his trial - and Jack Doolan, a highwayman who had used some money he had robbed to buy bread and cheese, which he was passing around to a group of hungry people when the constabulary found him. Jack had given Toby the reins of his horse and Polly some of the bread and cheese, which led to them being charged as two of ""the Doolan gang"".After a journey of eight months, the Northern Star sails through the headlands into the harbour on whose shores the colony is built. The convicts are greeted by the Lieutenant Governor, Colonel Lindsay Lightfoot, left in charge of the colony while the Governor is inspecting Norfolk Island. He reads out the rules of the colony and warns the convicts of the consequences of disobedience of orders. Toby and Polly see each other for the first time since the ship left England - women convicts had been kept in a separate area - but their reunion is cut short by a tall officer, Sergeant ""Bully"" Langden.Bully tells Colonel Lightfoot's aide, Captain Pertwee, that the military need five men to work on the Government farm, and he selects Big George, Jack, Dipper, Silly Billy and Toby for the task. Polly is taken away from the docks by Colonel Lightfoot's wife Augusta to assist her cook and laundrymaid. Toby falls to the ground before the convicts can be given the order to march. When Bully kicks away a cup of water that a woman tries to give Toby, Big George confronts Bully, who has to be rescued by several other soldiers. He decides to fix the troublemaking by marching the convicts straight to the blacksmith's shop, where they are each fitted with heavy chains around their ankles.Early next morning, the five convicts are aroused by Bully's deputy, Corporal ""Weazel"" Wesley, who issues them with a small ration of bread and some work tools before marching them out to begin their first day's work. Toby starts to struggle when the day gets hotter, but Dipper is the first to fall, gasping with pain and holding his bad leg trying not to collapse. The other convicts carry him to the shade, give him some water and fan him with his hat. He starts to recover when Weazel finds them. Jack cheerfully invites Weazel to join their ""picnic"", but Weazel aims his rifle at Jack's heart. A shot is fired, but Bully, who had fired the shot at a group of kangaroos in the scrub, calls on Weazel to help him. They soon find another slower target in the form of a koala and shoot it dead. Toby tries to rescue the baby koala who is on his dead mother's back, but he is caught by Bully, who throws the baby koala back into the bush.That night, Toby is too unhappy to either eat dinner or talk to anyone. As his friends lay down in their rough bunks, Dipper brings out a small round object, and as he opens it up, it begins to play some music. The object is a gentleman's watch with a music box in it, the only possession Dipper can truly call his own - it was given to him by his father, and long ago had been worn by Dipper's great-grandfather. The music sends Dipper's friends to sleep, allowing him to creep out of the hut and distract the guards by throwing some pebbles. As they chase after what they suppose is an intruder, Dipper sneaks back to the work site, finds the baby koala back near his mother's body, tucks him in an inside pocket that the baby thinks is his mother's pouch, and returns to the hut, distracting the guards again with some wild animal noises. In the hut, he takes out the baby koala and puts it in the crook of Toby's elbow. Toby wakes up and sees the koala and his face turns to joy, but no one, least of all Dipper, will admit to knowing how it got there.Four weeks on, Polly has become Augusta's only servant girl, and spends time shopping at the store so she can hear the news of the convicts. She finds out that Bully was reprimanded by the Lieutenant Governor for leaving the prisoners while he was shooting at the kangaroos. After Polly hears that Toby is allowed to keep his pet koala and Bully is ordered to remove Toby's leg-irons, Augusta sees Polly smile for the first time.At tea that night, Polly hears from Captain Pertwee that one of the convicts has been injured and, according to the surgeon, may not live. Terrified, she runs up the streets of Sydney Town towards the convicts' hut, but finds out that it is not Toby who is dying, but Dipper. The convicts had been felling trees, and Dipper had suffered another one of his leg cramps, but was ordered to continue working by Bully. Unable to move, Dipper couldn't get out of the way of a large and heavy trunk when it crashed to the ground so quickly that the other convicts weren't able to help him. With his last bit of strength, Dipper presses something into Toby's hand and tells him that he wants him to have it. When the other convicts have moved away, Toby shows the object, the music box watch, to Polly.In the days that follow Dipper's burial, Jack's behaviour changes - he stops making cheeky remarks to Bully as they work, he no longer calls Corporal Wesley ""Weazel"" to his face, and is allowed to hold the reins of Bully's mare as he quietens and calms it each morning. Toby often sees Jack looking towards the distant Blue Mountains, and one night hears Jack and George whispering to each other, and knows that Jack is planning to escape, not wanting to suffer the same fate as Dipper. All seems normal at the worksite the next morning, until George starts breaking all of the tools in pieces, drawing the attention of the soldiers and allowing Jack to untether the friendly horse and quietly turn it towards the mountains.Later that day, George is made to pay for assisting in Jack's escape - he is given fifty lashes while tied to a large wooden triangle in the public square and thrown into a punishment cell on Bully's orders, where he will spend every night for the next six months while he works at the blacksmith's shop during the day. Weeks later, Toby mouths the word ""tonight"" to George as he and Billy pass the cell on their way to work. That night, Polly, whom the Lightfoots have given permission to visit George in the punishment cell, and Toby smuggle some food from the Governor's kitchen and see George in the cell. George longs for Jack to help him escape the cell, and Toby comes up with a plan to search for Jack in the bush, taking the bundle of food intended for George, and his own pet koala. A noise causes Bully and Weazel to wake in the guardhouse and see Toby's shadow between the wire fence and scrub. Toby runs for his life and doesn't stop until he cannot hear the shouts of the pursuing guards behind him.As he continues to search for Jack in the night, keeping a tall mountain peak in front of him to stop him going around in circles, he gets a feeling that someone is following him, but he hears little, and doesn't see anything when he stops to look. He is sure that if it is one of the guards, they would make much more noise. He eventually flops onto the ground exhausted and sleeps until the early dawn when he is woken by a kookaburra and some cockatoos. He eats some of the provisions and then resumes his search.That evening, with his throat sore from calling Jack's name and all of the food Polly had provided gone, he is close to exhaustion when he finds a clearing with the remains of a dug-out fire. He feels the fire's ashes to see how warm they are when the sound of a snapping twig causes him to turn around. He sees a young Aborigine with a spear in his hand and a dingo at his side, but although Toby is terrified at first, he soon realises that the other boy is actually a friend. They get to know each other, with their arms and some sand providing them with ways to overcome their natural language barrier. Toby eventually finds out that his new friend is named Wahroonga, and he had been following Toby through the bush to make sure that no harm came to him or his koala. Wahroonga introduces Toby to his animal friends, a dingo and a cockatoo, shows him how to find water and food and invites him to stay the night in a gunya, an Aboriginal sleeping shelter on the edge of the clearing.Next morning, after Toby explains that he is trying to find Jack, a man riding on a horse, Wahroonga leads him to and along a dry river bed until they find a horse's hoof prints. They spend the next few hours following the river bed looking for more prints and other small clues to Jack's possible escape route. At one point, Wahroonga motions to Toby to stand still as he hears a horse neighing, and they hide behind a bush as two bushrangers pass them. Just as Toby and Wahroonga are ready to leave their hiding place, they hear a third horse approach them. They try to bury themselves in the sandy creek bed, but Toby hears the horse slow and stop, then footsteps approach them and a foot taps Toby on the shoulder. He is scared when he first turns around, until he realises that it's Jack Doolan.After introducing Jack to Wahroonga, Toby tells him stories of his adventures in the bush, but when Jack thinks Toby has run away too, he tells him about what has happened to Big George and why he ran away. Jack follows the path the bushrangers took earlier, and above their camp, he gets Toby and Wahroonga to roll a large boulder down the hill into the camp. It smashes into one of the huts, giving Jack a chance to unleash both of the horses and send one into the bush while he gallops back to the boys on the other. Moments later, Jack is back on his horse with Toby, Wahroonga and the koala on the other, with the dingo following them and the cockatoo overhead as they make their way back towards Sydney Town.On the edge of the convict settlement, Jack tells Toby that they will need to distract the guards to allow them to get near George's cell, and they will need some tools to break down the cell door. Toby remembers seeing tools in the storehouse next to the cell. As the guards are being served tea and stew, Jack gives a signal and Wahroonga gives a soft whistle to the cockatoo, which flies toward the line of soldiers and causes them to scatter in all directions. Another signal from Jack, and Wahroonga whispers a command to the dingo, which snaps and snarls at the soldiers' horses, causing them to rear and plunge, break their tethers and bolt toward the bush. The soldiers set off in pursuit and leave the settlement unguarded. Wahroonga keeps watch as Jack and Toby head for the store house. They find no tools there, only barrels of rum and oil. Jack gets Toby to open the oil barrels while he takes the rum and pours some into the soldiers' tea mugs and the rest into the boiler of tea. He makes it back to the store house just as the soldiers return with their horses.The soldiers drink the tea and line up for several cupfuls from the cook, who eventually tastes the brew for himself, all getting drunk on the rum Jack had put into it. As they boisterously continue drinking the tea, Jack sends Toby to collect Silly Billy while he heads for the guardhouse to get the keys to Big George's cell. With all three convicts back in the store house, Jack begins to pour some of the oil on the ground while Toby and Billy take the key and unlock the punishment cell. Silly Billy yells at George in case he is asleep, but Bully hears the noise and tries to rouse the soldiers. Jack hurls the last barrel of oil to the ground and hops over it before it spreads everywhere. The convicts think they will be trapped by the soldiers, but one by one the soldiers slide on the oil and fall to the ground. Despite his drunken state, Bully stays focussed on Jack and while kneeling, he aims a rifle at him. At that moment, a boomerang thrown by Wahroonga hits Bully on the back of his neck, sending his gunshot through a window of the Governor's house (causing a frightened Polly to drop the oil lamp she is carrying) before he falls unconscious to the ground.At the first shouts of the commotion made by the drunken soldiers, Colonel Lightfoot, convinced by his wife Augusta that the Aborigines were attacking the settlement, had dashed out of the house with a sword in his hand leaving her on her own. She hears light footsteps and sees a flickering gleam of lights, and when the door opens, she faints out of fear before she can find out what happened. Polly is also trembling with fright - the lights come from the flame of the dropped lamp which ignited on the now-spreading oil. The fire engulfs the house so fast that Polly and Augusta are trapped inside.As the four convicts begin their escape, Wahroonga sees the flames coming out of the house and signals to them. Big George recognises it as the Governor's house, and leads a mad dash toward the building. There is smoke and flame coming out of every window as they arrive, and they can hear Polly's and Augusta's cries from within. George finds a large water barrel with a bucket beside it, throws some water over himself and Jack and gets Toby to throw more water on them as they smash the door off its hinges. Inside, George follows the sound of Polly's cries and sees her and Augusta at the bottom of a staircase, with a fallen beam blocking their escape.George bends over and puts his shoulders underneath the large beam, straining his body to slowly ease it up enough for Augusta and Polly to leave. Hearing a squad of soldiers led by the Lieutenant Governor himself, Toby contemplates escaping, but throws more buckets of water on Billy, Jack and himself before they rush in to guide Polly and Augusta out of the house. With all five of them outside, George heaves the beam off his shoulders and rushes to join them as the house begins to collapse behind him. Polly and Augusta fall into the arms of their respective brother and husband. A couple of hours later, the four convicts explain to Colonel Lightfoot all of the things they did, why they did them and who had helped them. Toby tries to introduce Wahroonga in the middle of his story, only to discover that he has disappeared into the shadows of the bush along with his dingo and cockatoo, which gives a farewell shriek on its way towards the mountains.The artist wraps up his story by telling us that Bully is found guilty of being drunk on duty and locked away in the same punishment cell into which he had thrown Big George, until his temper improved, while the Lieutenant Governor grants the brave convicts who saved his wife full pardons and grants of land on which they could start their own farms - a happy ending for Billy, George, Jack and Polly. He starts to tell us about Toby, but then looks at his watch and realises that he has to end the story because it's getting late. He tells us that the watch plays a little tune when he opens it up, and he has had it for several years, ever since it was given to him by a dear old man named Dipper. He then points his granddaughter to the nearby merry-go-round, where the people that she sees on it bear likenesses to the characters from his paintings and the animation."

tt0079501,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'SciFi', 'Thriller']","The film is set in the near future of a bleak, dystopian and impoverished Australia that is facing a breakdown of civil order primarily due to widespread oil shortages. (This is not explained in this film but in the sequel, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior.) Central to the plot is a poorly-funded national police unit called the Main Force Patrol (MFP, derogatorily called ""The Bronze"" by their enemies), which struggles to protect the Outback's few remaining townspeople from violent motorcycle gangs. The MFP's ""top pursuit man"" is a young police officer, Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson), badge number MFP4073.A member of one of the motorcycle gangs, Crawford Montazano (nicknamed ""The Nightrider""), escapes from police custody by killing an officer and stealing his vehicle. MFP officers pursue the Nightrider in a high-speed chase that results in several serious wrecks. Among those involved is a cocky motorcycle cop nicknamed Goose (Steve Bisley), who radios Max. Max pursues Nightrider in a high-speed chase, first beating him in a game of Chicken and then catching up to him and hanging off his back bumper. The Nightrider and his girlfriend die in a fiery crash. After the dangerous chase, Max' police chief, Fifi McAfee, warns Max that Nightrider's gang will be out for him now because of Nightrider's death.Nightrider's gang, which is led by Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne), plans to avenge Nightrider's death by killing MFP officers. Meanwhile, they vandalize property, steal fuel, and terrorize the citizenry. While chewing up a town where the Nightrider's remains arrived by train, the gang brutalizes a civilian couple that tried escaping to the road; the couple is overtaken, then both of them are raped and the car is wrecked. Max and Goose are informed about the incident and go to the crime scene. They find Toecutter's young protegé, Johnny the Boy (Tim Burns), and the girl from the car in the middle of the wreckage. Johnny's drug-fueled rantings reveal him as a member of Nightrider's gang; Goose looks on Johnny with particular disdain, as his leg was broken during the Nightrider pursuit. However, they do not kill Johnny, but arrest him and drag him away in chains.Johnny is held at the MFP's dilapidated Halls of Justice pending a visit from the Court. However, when the attorneys arrive, Johnny is ordered released: the judge has set Johnny free because no witnesses showed up for the trial. (Without the testimony of witnesses, no charges could be filed; the courts declared ""no contest"" for the case.) A shocked Goose attacks Johnny and must be physically restrained; both Goose and Johnny shout threats of revenge at each other. The second-in-command of the biker group, Bubba Zanetti (Geoff Parry) arrives at the courthouse to pick up Johnny, on orders from the Toecutter. Bubba does so begrudgingly, because he hates Johnny for his rowdiness, lack of style and drug addiction, and hates the Toecutter's favoritism towards Johnny.Shortly thereafter, Johnny the Boy sabotages Goose's MFP motorcycle while Goose is shacked up with a singer he met at a cabaret. His rear wheel locks up at high speed the next day, throwing Goose from the bike; Goose, however, survives without even suffering ""road rash"". Goose borrows a ute to haul his bike back to civilization. Unfortunately, Johnny ambushes Goose, throwing a brake drum through the ute's windshield, causing Goose to roll the vehicle over, Gas leaks from the fuel tank, soaking the ground around the truck; Johnny, at the belligerent urging of the Toecutter himself, then burns Goose alive in the wreckage. Goose survives, but after seeing his charred body in the hospital's burn ward, Max becomes angry and disillusioned with the police force and resigns from the MFP with no intention of returning. He takes a road trip with his wife and infant son in the relatively peaceful coastal area north of their home.While on holiday, Max's wife, Jessie, (played by Joanne Samuel) runs into Toecutter's gang, who harass her. She escapes, but the gang manages to track her to the farm where she and Max are staying. Jessie and her son are run down by the gang, who leave their crushed bodies in the middle of the road. Max arrives too late to intervene. His son is pronounced dead on the scene, while his wife suffers massive injuries. (It is revealed in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior that she later died from her injuries.)Filled with obsessive rage, Max once again dons his police outfit, straps on his sawn-off shotgun, and steals a supercharged black Pursuit Special to pursue the gang. He methodically hunts down and kills the gang members: several gang members are forced off a bridge at high speed while others spill their bikes; Max shoots Bubba off his cycle with his shotgun (Bubba shoots Max in the leg with a pistol first, though, giving Max a limp that is consistent throughout the series, then runs over his exposed arm). Max struggles back into his car and pursues the Toecutter into a forbidden area. Max forces the gang's leader into the path of a speeding tractor trailer and he is crushed in a head-on collision.Max later finds Johnny the Boy taking the boots off a dead driver at the scene of a crash. Johnny desperately tries to convince Max that the man was dead when he found him and that his drug addiction has made him mentally unbalanced. Max doesn't listen and handcuffs Johnny's ankle to the wrecked, overturned vehicle with a ruptured petrol tank. Max lights a crude time-delay fuse and gives Johnny a hacksaw, leaving him the choice of sawing through either the handcuffs (which will take 10 minutes) or his ankle (which will take 5 minutes), and then drives off into the desolate outback, ignoring Johnny's frantic ramblings. The camera shows Max's car from the front, with a large and fiery explosion in the distance behind it, leaving Johnny's fate unknown. Max blankly continues to drive in a rainstorm into the Outback, a shell of his former self."

While attempting to begin a new novel, 42-year-old Isaac (Woody Allen), a successful television comedy writer, struggles to describe his main character's view of Manhattan and its inhabitants.At Elaine's restaurant, Isaac has dinner with his 17-year-old girlfriend, Tracy (Mariel Hemmingway), and his friends, the married couple, Yale (Michael Murphy) and Emily (Anne Byrne). The four discuss luck, art, courage, and, after Tracy leaves for the restroom, the remaining three discuss her age. Isaac tells his friends that his ex-wife, Jill, who recently left him for another woman, is writing a book about the breakup of their marriage. This troubles Isaac, because the work will reveal personal details about him and their relationship. Leaving early because Tracy has a high school exam the next morning, the group walks along the sidewalk. As Emily and Tracy follow a few steps behind Yale and Isaac, Yale reveals to Isaac that he is having an affair.One day, Isaac confronts Jill (Meryl Streep) on the street and begs her not to publish the book and expresses concern about their young son, Willy, who is now being raised by Jill and her life partner Connie (Karen Ludwig).At his apartment in the evening, Isaac and Tracy discuss her past relationships and she tells Isaac that she is in love with him. He is less committal and suggests that she not be so quick to jump to that conclusion. She questions his feelings for her but he in turn argues that at her age she should not be limited to just him.At an art exhibit, Isaac and Tracy encounter Yale and his mistress, Mary (Diane Keaton). The four talk about art and philosophy, about which Isaac and Mary, a writer, disagree vehemently. Afterwards, Tracy and Isaac are food shopping and he, still angry, complains about Mary.At the television studio where he works, Isaac becomes frustrated with the results of his material and quits his job. Meeting with Yale afterward, Isaac worries about his newfound unemployment and his financial burdens, which include alimony, child support, and costly rent. Talk also turns to the book Isaac is working on.That evening, at a Museum of Modern Art fundraiser, Isaac runs into Mary. They talk briefly with some of her friends and then the two leave together. While walking, they talk about Isaac quitting his job, his writing, her friends, and her past marriage. After picking up Mary's dog, the two take it for a walk, eventually sitting on a bench together watching the sun come up over the Queensboro Bridge.That morning, Isaac phones Yale and tells him about his evening with Mary and attempts to discern how committed Yale is to her, without admitting that he has become interested in her. Later, Yale and Mary talk about their affair and what direction it is heading.Isaac picks up his son from Jill's house and again pleads with her to not publish the book. She reminds him of his past erratic behavior, including the time he tried to run over her new lover.A day or so later, Mary calls Yale to see if he wants to go out. When he declines, she calls Isaac. They decide to meet, and as they walk together a violent thunderstorm breaks out, causing them to seek shelter in a planetarium. As they walk through the darkness, their relationship develops and Mary confides her frustration with Yale, who is not ready to break up with Emily.Later at dinner, Tracy tells Isaac about an opportunity she has to study acting in London. Although she is reluctant to leave him, he encourages her, saying how good it would be for her.At Bloomingdales one day, Mary and Yale converse about her growing anxiety over their affair. At the same time, Tracy helps Isaac move to a cheaper apartment. On his first night there, they are in bed together, and Isaac complains about the intrusive sounds in the new building, and is similarly bothered by the brown water from the tap.Tracy relates her concerns about their future together, but he remains noncommittal, claiming he wants the best for her. Mary and Yale agree that they have to stop seeing each other, and Yale tells Isaac that he should pursue Mary. Isaac is flattered by the suggestion, but also hesitant. When Isaac and Mary decide to see a movie, they argue again.Back at her home, Isaac tries to kiss Mary, but she resists and instead they discuss their budding relationship. Mary and Isaac spend a day together, visiting a museum and having dinner, eventually spending the night with each other.Sometime later on one afternoon, Isaac meets Tracy outside her school, where she gives him a harmonica as a gift. Isaac again talks about Tracy's age and questions her understanding of love. He says they should not see each other any longer and that he has fallen in love with someone else. Tracy is quite upset, realizing that his earlier expressions of concern for her were really masking his ambivalence. However, Isaac feels the decision should have been expected.In the country together, Mary and Isaac talk about the positive path their relationship is taking, Mary going so far as to say that she could imagine having kids with Isaac.Sometime later, Yale invites Isaac and Mary to spend an evening with him and Emily. The result is an awkward evening for the four of them.While shopping one day, Isaac and Mary run into Jeremiah, her previous romantic partner. Based on Mary's description of him as a great lover, Jeremiah is physically not what Isaac imagined.One night together, Isaac tells Mary she is wasting her talent writing novelizations of movies. Their talk is interrupted by a phone call from Yale, who wants to meet Mary. She refuses, but tells Isaac the call was from someone offering free dance lessons. Later, Isaac tells Emily that publishers have responded favorably to the first four chapters of his book.While shopping in the country, Isaac and Mary, and Yale and Emily notice and purchase a copy of Jill's book. Yale reads aloud from it to everyone's amusement, except, of course, Isaac, who is offended by what he hears.Back in the city, Isaac confronts Jill, who reveals to him that there has already been interest in making the book into a movie. Isaac arrives home to tell Mary about the encounter, but she tells him that she is still in love with Yale, that she has been seeing him again, and that he is actually moving out so that they can be together. Isaac is shocked and promptly rushes to meet Yale at the university where he teaches. Isaac angrily chides his friend and questions his actions.Days later, Emily tells Isaac that she knew about the affair and, unaware of Yale and Mary's previous attachment, says she thinks their breakup was due to Isaac introducing Mary to Yale. Isaac tells Emily that he misses Tracy, noting the pleasant times they spent together.At home alone, Isaac records ideas for a book. In doing so, he contemplates what makes life worthwhile and this line of thought eventually causes him to think about Tracy. He plays briefly on the harmonica then tries to call her. Abruptly, he races out the door and runs several blocks and catches Tracy just before she leaves for London. Isaac tells her about his feelings. He says he made a mistake and does not want her to go and that he loves her. However, it is too late, as her arrangements have already been made. She reassures him that she will only be gone for six months, and then they can be together, concluding that he just needs to have a little faith in people (implying that they might get back together again someday, when she is of legal age).An instrumental version of ""Embraceable You"" plays over the end credits."
tt0079540,"['Comedy', 'contentRating', 'PG']","Very early in the morning at Camp North Star, an alarm clock wakens the head counselor, Tripper. He dons a kid's space cadet helmet and switches on the camp's PA system. His public service announcement informs the camp's counselors that they should get out of bed and report to for their assigned duties. He also expects that the summer session at the camp will be fun. Tripper forgets to turn the microphone off and takes it into the bathroom with him. The sound of a toilet flushing is heard across the camp. The other counselors are seen doing landscaping, painting, replacing windows and generally getting the camp ready.At the rendezvous for the campers, Tripper has his staff gather the kids and get them on the buses. Some of the kids have bad attitudes and have to be threatened with bodily harm. One of the counselors, Spaz, a nerdy type with taped-together glasses, is met by some counselors from North Star's rival summer camp, Mohawk. They seize his milkshake and pour it over his head. A news reporter is doing a story on Mohawk, which has a much richer budget, a long waiting list, stringent approval standards and seems like a luxury for its campers. Tripper talks to the reporter, posing as Mohawk's program director and gives him bogus information about the camp's activities, including ""Sexual Awareness Week"" when prostitutes are brought into the camp and the campers earn prizes for cavorting with as many as they can.Among the campers is a young kid named Rudy. Shy and lacking in self-confidence, he doesn't want to go to camp but his father insists. The buses bring the campers to North Star where they're assigned to their counselors and cabins. The head of the camp is Morty, a clumsy but likeable leader. He hands Tripper a list of rules for the camp, which Trip promptly tears up and throws in a trash bin.At chow, the camp's gossip expert informs everyone that several romances are brewing or continuing among the counselors, much to their embarrassment. Rudy participates in his first ever soccer game and accidentally scores on his own goalie. He's ridiculed and stalks off hurt. He packs his things and walks to the nearby town to catch a bus home. Tripper shows up and talks to Rudy in a kind tone, telling him that he just needs to make a few friends and he'll have a great summer. If anyone gives him any trouble, Trip tells him to go directly to him.Rudy and Tripper become friends, Rudy joining him for morning runs and staying up late to play cards - Tripper is no match for the budding card shark in Rudy, who takes home nearly all the peanuts they'd been using for wagers. Seeing a few good character traits in Rudy, Tripper later puts him in charge of making the PA announcements while he takes the counselors-in-training (CITs) on an overnight trip. At the overnight, Tripper and the other head counselor, Roxanne, become closer, despite Tripper's previous unwanted advances.North Star heads over to Camp Mohawk for the annual basketball game. North Star has continually lost to the ringer athletes of Mohawk, who also cheat to win. With his team many points in the hole, Tripper tells them they can lose with self-respect: at the next tip-off, the North Star players yank the shorts of their rivals down to their ankles and run. Joined by the North Star spectators and Tripper, they make it to their bus and triumphantly race back to their camp, Tripper proclaiming ""This is the proudest day in North Star history!""Parent's Day arrives, with Morty, his bed and his nightstand hung from a tree near the camp's entrance as a prank by Tripper and his CITs. Rudy's father is unable to come to the event and he spends the day jogging with Tripper around the woods.The big event of the summer is the Olympiad that takes place between Mohawk and North Star. North Star has lost consistently to Mohawk for the past 13 years, primarily because they can't match the skill of the Mohawk athletes but also because Mohawk is notorious for cheating. Beating North Star at several events, Mohawk takes an early and seemingly insurmountable lead in points. When all hope seems lost, Tripper rallies everyone in the camp. North Star begins to cheat just as cleverly as Mohawk does and they begin a solid comeback, winning in a speed swimming event, a wrestling match, the sauce/teacup contest (won by the klutzy Spaz) and in the hot dog eating contest, where the chubby CIT Fink is able to beat Mohawk's champion, The Stomach, while Tripper frantically coaches him and massages his stomach.Morty announces that they're only 20 points behind Mohawk and can win with the final event, a short, cross-country run. Unfortunately, North Star's best runner, Jackie, was fouled during the field hockey game by two Mohawk players and is out with a broken ankle. Tripper volunteers Rudy, saying he's been running with him all summer and is in shape enough to win. Rudy immediately objects but Tripper tells him he has the utmost confidence in him. He tells him that he probably can't outrun Mohawk's runner on the open road but when the course enters the woods, he can outpace him because he's smaller and able to avoid a lot of the foliage.The run begins and Rudy paces his opponent steadily until they enter the woods. Rudy takes off, outdistancing his opponent, gaining a solid lead. When they hit the homestretch, Rudy is able to keep his lead and finishes the victor. The camp rallies to Rudy as the camp champion.
Tripper and Roxanne escort Rudy back to his cabin that night where Rudy is greeted heartily by his mates. Tripper takes the CITs to a final campfire where they all drink champagne to celebrate their victory with Morty. They all sing a song about the more rotten aspects of being camp counselors. Tripper talks to Roxanne about moving in with him back home. Roxanne says she'll join him.The next morning, everyone prepares to go home. Rudy is asked by one of his mates if he'd like to come to a camp his father is opening. Rudy turns him down, saying he'll return to North Star. Roxanne suggests they say goodbye to Morty: out on the lake, Morty has been placed on a raft with his bed and nightstand to drift until he wakes up. Tripper gathers everyone together for the ride out, taking Roxanne with him on his motorcycle.On the lake, Morty wakes up to find he's stranded while the credits roll."
tt0079574,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'SciFi', 'Thriller']","The 1st part of the pre-title teaser shows a space shuttle (called a ""Moonraker"") being carried on a large cargo plane. Inside the shuttle, two men emerge from hidden compartments and start launch procedures for the shuttle. They fly off, destroying the cargo plane they were being ferried on. The shuttle was built for the British government and was en route there when it was stolen over the Yukon Territory in Canada. M, head of MI6, orders Miss Moneypenny to contact his best agent, James Bond, and have him report in. Moneypenny says that Bond is currently in flight, returning from a mission in Africa. On board the private jet, Bond is betrayed by the flight attendant and the plane's captain. The flight attendant escapes and Bond briefly battles with the pilot, throwing him from the plane. As Bond watches the man slip away, he is pushed out of the plan by Jaws (who returns from The Spy Who Loved Me). Bond plummets and is able to catch the pilot and wrestles his chute from him. As he puts it on and free-falls, he is attacked by Jaws, but Bond pulls the chord on his own chute; Jaws tries the same but his chute doesn't open. He is seen falling into a circus tent; the first animated image of the opening title sequence suggests he fell into the high-wire safety net inside (in a scene apparently shot but not used, Jaws staggers unharmed to his feet and watches James land harmlessly miles away).Bond reports to M's office where Q and Minister of Defense Sir Frederick Gray are waiting. They report that the shuttle went missing somewhere over the Yukon Territory and, while the plane wreckage has been found, there's no sign of the Moonraker. Bond is ordered to begin his investigation of the shuttle's disappearance at the industrial complex where it was built by the Drax Corporation. Before he leaves, Bond is given a new wristwatch by Q that can fire specialized darts - one type are steel-tipped and armor piercing, the others contain cyanide.Bond in California and is taken by pilot Corinne Dufour over the vast industrial station of Drax Industries and to the estate of industrialist and billionaire, Hugo Drax, for a brief meeting. The estate is at the edge of a forest straddling the Mojave Desert, and it impresses James for its vast size and built entirely with stones brought in from France. It also doubles as an exercise ground for astronaut trainees.Drax thanks Bond for appearing in person to apologize for the loss of his shuttle. Bond, however, is not there to apologize and, though he asks about the mysterious disappearance of the shuttle, he receives no conclusive answers. Bond is taken to meet Dr Holly Goodhead, who gives him a tour of the facilities. She suggests that Bond try out the g-force training vehicle. While he rides in it, Drax' personal bodyguard, Chang, refits the control panel (disabling the kill switch for the vehicle) and attempts to kill Bond with a fatal amount of g-force. Bond disables the machine by shooting one of the darts given to him by Q into the control panel. While Goodhead apologizes, Bond sees Chang leaving the control room.Later that evening, after recovering from the nausea of the centrifuge, Bond meets Miss Dufour; he charms her and they make love. He sneaks out of her room and into Drax' private office. Dufour discovers him there but does not attempt to stop him. Bond finds Drax' safe and photographs engineering schematics for a small electronic device and a larger pod of some sort both made by a glass company called Venini, located in Venice, Italy. As he and Dufour slip out of the office, they don't notice that Chang sees them go. The next morning, before he's scheduled to leave, Bond is asked to join Drax for pheasant hunting. During the match, Bond slyly kills an assassin planted nearby by Drax. He leaves just as Dufour arrives. Knowing of her betrayal, Drax tells her that she's fired; he lets his trained Beaucerons loose and they chase her through the forest, killing her.Bond arrives in Venice, going immediately to the Venini glass works indicated in the plans he stole. He finds several workers making small containers that match the dimensions of those in the schematics. Joining a tour of the factory, he sees Holly Goodhead, who quickly leaves. Bond catches up with her and asks to meet her later, which she refuses. Bond heads off in a gondola - while floating down a canal, he is attacked by a knife-throwing assassin in a coffin, who kills Bond's pilot. Bond is able to kill him and activates the gondola's power motor and takes off. He is chased though the canals by two more men in a powerboat but eludes them by entering Venice's Grand Canal and activating the gondola's hovercraft which he rides into St. Mark's Square.Bond returns that night to Venini & finds a laboratory where two scientists are working in a private lab. He notices a pod that matches the schematics from Drax' safe that contains some of the small glass containers he'd seen earlier. In the small containers are small electronic devices that contain vials of a clear fluid. Hearing the scientists returning, he hides, leaving one of the devices with the vials where it falls to the floor and shatters when the men move the pod. The liquid quickly becomes aerosol and the room is automatically sealed. Both men die but the animals in cages in the room do not. As he leaves, Bond is attacked by a man wearing Japanese kendo gear, who is soon revealed to be Chang. The two carry their combat into the Venini glassware museum and destroy it. They fight further, ending up behind a glass clock overlooking a fine restaurant. As they continue the fight, Bond notices crates that are bound for Rio de Janeiro that contain the large pods he'd seen in the lab. Eventually, Bond throws Chang through the clock headfirst into a grand piano, killing him.Bond arrives later at Goodhead's hotel and finds her in her room. He reveals his knowledge of her being a CIA agent. The two spend the night together after Bond finds an airline ticket in her name to Rio de Janeiro. Bond leaves early in the morning and escorts M and Minister Gray to the Drax laboratory he'd found the night before. When they enter, the lab has been cleared out and all traces of the pods, vials and other experimental equipment are gone; only Drax remains in a lavishly decorated office. Gray apologizes for the intrusion and, after leaving the office, orders M to take Bond off the case. Bond gives M the vial he'd stolen the previous night and tells M to have it tested by Q with ""extreme caution"" due to is deadly nature. M tells Bond to take two weeks leave and asks where he'll go; Bond says he'll go to Rio de Janeiro to follow Goodhead and the Venini pods.Bond arrives in Rio and begins to investigate again. During carnivale, he and his assistant, Manuela, find another storage facility owned by Drax, where Bond finds a shipping label from Drax Airfreight. In the street, Manuela is approached by a carnivale-goer in a large costume; it is Jaws, a hulking henchman with steel teeth hired by Drax soon after Chang was killed. Bond arrives, though he is unable to fend off Jaws completely, but the henchman is whisked away by another passing group of celebrators.The next day, Bond takes a cable car to a observation platform overlooking Rio. He sees that planes belonging to Drax Airfreight are taking off from a nearby small airport. On the mountain, he once again finds Holly Goodhead, who tells him that the Drax planes have been departing frequently, every two hours. They both decide to return to Rio to investigate further, however, their cable car descent is interrupted by Jaws who bites through the heavy cable with his steel teeth. Bond and Goodhead battle the thug and are able to escape when Bond loops a chain around a cable and they slide down. Jaws follows in one of the cars but is unable to stop, colliding with the station at the bottom. As he tries to remove a wheel from his neck, he meets a young blond woman with large glasses, Dolly, who helps him and the two fall instantly in love.Bond and Goodhead, having leaped from the chain before reaching the cable house, are picked up by an ambulance. The paramedics are likely Drax' men and the two are bound to their gurneys. Bond escapes his and is thrown from the ambulance, but Goodhead is unable to escape.Bond reports to the new headquarters M and Q have set up outside Rio; Q reports that his analysis of the fluid in the vial reveals that it came from a rare orchid from the Amazonian Jungle region. The fluid, which originally caused sterility in the native tribe that inhabited the area, has been modified to cause death in humans only. Bond travels in a highly specialized boat to the Amazon and is engaged once again by Jaws and several henchmen in boats. Bond uses the defenses of his own boat to destroy most of them and escapes over a large grouping of waterfalls (they are actually the Iguazu Falls, hundreds of miles away near Argentina) by using a hang glider. Jaws winds up going over the falls in his boat. Bond crash-lands in the jungle where he spies a beautiful woman and follows her to a lagoon; he is cast into a pool where a large python is sent to kill him. Bond kills the snake with Goodhead's poison-tipped pen and is grabbed by Jaws. He is taken to Drax' control room where the launching of several Moonraker shuttles is being observed. Drax reveals that he'd originally ordered the theft of the British Moonraker because one of the original fleet developed a last-minute malfunction. Drax orders Bond to be taken to a conference room directly below the launchpad of one of the shuttles where Goodhead is trapped. Drax leaves them there to be incinerated during the launch. They escape the room and assume the identities of two Moonraker crew members after rendering them unconscious. They board the last Moonraker and are launched into space on a programmed flight plan. Bond checks the cargo area and sees several young couples as passengers; upon this sight James analogizes the scene to the story of Noah's Ark.In space, the Moonrakers arrive at a space station, hidden from detection on Earth by a radar cloaking device. The station is activated and Drax initiates his ultimate plan: he will launch the fluid extracted from the orchids into the atmosphere of Earth where they will exterminate human life, leaving vegetation and animal life behind. The couples that he has brought into space will breed and their descendants will return to Earth as a new race of humans to populate it. Bond and Goodhead find the station's radar jammer and deactivate it, making the station visible from Earth. The US Air Force in the person of General Scott contacts Soviet General Gogol reassuring him the now-visible station isn't US, and the Air Force launches a shuttle with a US Marine strike team towards the station.Bond and Goodhead are discovered by Jaws who takes them to Drax. Bond remarks aloud that the only humans who will be allowed to live are those like Drax' ""perfect specimens"", IE, those who are physically fit and genetically superior. Jaws suddenly realizes that Drax' plan will not include either himself, because of his abnormal size and his steel teeth and Dolly because of her imperfect vision. Jaws decides to join forces with Bond and attacks the guards. A fight breaks out as the British shuttle arrives. Drax still orders the launching of the deadly pods. He is found escaping by Bond who fires one of his cyanide darts at Drax; he pushes the villain into an airlock and blasts him into space to his death. Meanwhile, the strike team has taken out the station team and fly away before the station, suffering catastrophic damage, explodes. Goodhead and Bond escape in Drax' shuttle, which is armed with a high-powered laser and pursue the pods. Jaws and Dolly plummet back to Earth in portion of the station; inside, Jaws opens a bottle of champagne and says ""Well, here's to us!"", his only spoken words in the Bond series.Bond and Goodhead race towards the pods, destroying them all with the shuttle's laser cannon. Bond is forced to destroy the last one without the weapon's computer targeting system, but succeeds. Back on Earth, M an Q try to locate Bond, who is orbiting the earth in the shuttle and enjoying a gravity-free romantic tryst with Goodhead."

A plant manager asks Norma if she knows the organizer.A mill manager, Jimmy Jerome Davis (Jack Stryker), says to Reuben, 'One of you guys shows up every four years, about the same time we get the locusts.' Reuben: We got six of you boys in civil contempt. Would you care to make it seven? Davis: We plaster the toilet with them things.Norma is called into the boss' office. The boss, Tommy Gardner (Lonnie Chapman) says, 'Norma you got the biggest mouth in this mill. ""Give us a longer break. Give us more smoking time. Give us a Kotex pad machine.""' The only way to get her to close that mouth is to give her a promotion. She's going to be a spot checker. 'Well, hell, it sure ain't gonna make me any friends.' 'It'll make you an extra dollar and a half an hour. 'Norma accepts the position. On the mill floor, she monitors employees as they work. She comes to her father's station. She asks him to speed up if he can. 'I'm going as fast as I can.' 'They're watching me. They're watching you,' she says. At home, her father gives her the silent treatment, then, 'I don't think you should push your own Daddy. I don't need that from my kid.'A nighttime softball game. Norma goes to the concession stand to buy a hot dog and runs into Reuben again. She also comes across Ellis Harper, the father one of her two children. Reuben follows her back to her seat. 'I climbed into the backseat of his Cadillac one rainy night six years ago, stuck my feet out the back window, and got myself my little Craig off that Southern gentleman. He ain't done nothin' worthwhile since.' She asks Reuben: What do you think of me? 'I think you're too smart for what's happening to you.'Back at the mill. Norma is spot-checking Sonny Webster (Beau Bridges). He mocks her, speeds up, jumps into a cart of loose cotton, weaves in and out and around the machinery. 'Come on, lady. I'm over here now! Mark me down! Mark me down!' 'You damn fool! You're gonna get us both to lose our jobs.'Norma is at home folding laundry and the doorbell rings. It's Sonny Webster. He's come to apologize. He got handed divorce papers that morning. Norma steps out on to the porch to speak with him. He asks if she would have a drink with him. She agrees and goes inside to get ready. Her father reminds her of all the men she's had relationships with, none of whom are taking care of her now. She goes out anyway.At the bar, Sonny and Norma are drinking. Reuben appears. A song comes on the jukebox that reminds Norma of her husband's death-Buddy Wilson was killed in a fight in a 'beer joint.' Reuben drives Sonny and Norma home.Back at the mill. Norma is ignored by her co-workers. She goes to the boss' office. She's quitting. 'You're speeding up the machines to weed them out.' 'You knew all that.' 'Yeah. I was greedy, and I was dumb.' She throws down her clipboard, takes off her spotter's jacket, and goes back to her machine. One of her co-workers helps her on with her apron.Sonny takes Norma, her kids, and his daughter, Alice, to the lake. There he describes the type of husband he will be if they were married. They get married.Bonnie Mae hands Norma a flier. Reuben is speaking at a meeting that evening, and she's going.The meeting is at a local church, a black church. Norma and Bonnie Mae are seated in the front row. They are the only white people present, other than three white men at the back. Reuben gives an impassioned speech about what a union is: One. Different people, different races, different religions, speaking with one voice. The textile industry is the only industry in the United States that is not unionized. 'They are free to exploit you, to lie to you, to cheat you, and to take away from you what is rightfully yours. I urge you to come over to Room 31 at the Golden Cherry Motel and pick up a union card and sign it.' Norma's is transfixed with Reuben as she applauds.Reuben arrives at the mill for an inspection. Even though the O.P. Henley mill is not unionized, a federal government court order stipulates the textile union has the right to inspect every bulletin board in the mill to ensure its notices are not being stripped off.Accompanied by a group of managers, Reuben inspects the first bulletin board. The notice is way above eye level. After Reuben threatens to call his lawyer, the notice is lowered so that its easily seen. He reads the notice and demands to see the other bulletin board. He is ushered through the weaving room. On his way he passes Norma at her machine. The second bulletin board is almost entirely hidden behind rolls of textile material. He has the textiles removed. Norma follows the developments from a distance.Norma visits Reuben at the motel. 'If I joined up with you will I lose my job?' Reuben: No way. You can wear a union button, talk union to co-workers during your break, hand out union pamphlets. They can't touch you. Norma Rae: I'll go along with you. Reuben: You're the fish I wanted to hook. Norma Rae Webster signs up and begins recruiting volunteers.Norma asks her reverend to allow a union meeting at the white church the following Saturday. 'Blacks and whites sitting together.' The reverend refuses.Norma invite black and white co-workers to her house for the union meeting. Norma explains to her neighbor why black men are at her house. 'The shades are going to be up.' Sonny takes Norma aside: You're going too far, Norma. This is our home. Norma Rae: How am I going too far? Sonny: There's a bunch of black men in there. You're gonna get us in a whole bunch of trouble. Norma Rae: I never had any trouble with black men. The only trouble I ever had in my life was with white men.The mill workers tell their stories of hardships at the mill.After the meeting Reuben tells Norma he isn't getting his message across. 'Only 17 people out of 800.' It's because you're an outsider, she replies. Reuben: You got any ideas? Norma Rae: Get some corn whiskey and meet on Saturday. We're gonna hit the back roads.
Reuben and Norma drive around the back roads handing out fliers. At one stop Reuben slips, falls, and soils his shirt on a mound of cow dung. Norma Rae: Its only grass and water, Reuben. At a waterhole Norma washes the shirt while Reuben swims in the nude. Reuben: This is the life! Norma finishes washing the shirt, strips off, and jumps in.Late at night Norma is seated at her dining table, on the phone doing union business. Sonny emerges from the bedroom: You ain't gettin' any sleep. I ain't gettin' any sleep and I got to get to work in the mornin'. Norma says she's got a hundred phone calls to make. Sonny is angry. Norma didn't get to the market, to the kids, and 'to me!' Norma, even more angry, rises, and mocks doing the household chores-cooking, washing, ironing, making love. Sonny calms down, strokes her face, and kisses her on the cheek.Norma is handing out union information during her break. Unlike Reuben, she can relate to the workers on a personal level. Norma's father, Vernon, is sitting by the gate. 'Well I don't bump into you much anymore now, do I?' 'You alright Daddy?' 'Sometimes I wonder when I lie down if I'm gonna get back up again'. 'Don't talk old to me. I don't like it.' 'I'm gonna come over there one of these nights...and take you out to a grand supper.' 'OK.'Millworkers are being stretched at the mill. Then, at the next union meeting, no one shows up. Reuben visits one of the volunteers who quit volunteering, Warren Latting. Warren: 'They got us on a stretch-out. Put us on a three-day week. Twice as much work for half the pay. All on account of you.' He shows Reuben six turnips and two quarts of water. Dinner for seven people. 'Just go sell your union someplace else.' He slams the door in Reuben's face.Vernon is working feverishly at his post. Jimmy Jerome Davis comes over. 'My arm's going numb on me, Jimmy. I think I better go and lie down.' 'You got a break in fifteen minutes.' Minutes later Vernon collapses. Norma and family attend Vernon's funeral.At the Golden Cherry motel, mill-workers are back doing union work. Norma chews out a worker who shows up late. Reuben throws her out of the room but catches up with her at a nearby diner. 'You can't come down that hard on a man...Leave him his balls.' 'You ain't mad at me?' 'If the situation ever called for a smart, loud, profane, sloppy, hard-working woman, I'd pick you every time, kid.'Late one night, Norma is napping at the Golden Cherry motel. She is awakened by two men. They're from the union national headquarters. When Reuben arrives, they suggest Norma leave. Reuben: 'What do you guys want?' 'This is a small Baptist town,' one man replies. 'The mill hands in this town go to church every Sunday. They say she's made a porno movie with a local police officer. Very explicit...' 'Show it to me.' 'There doesn't have to be a movie, people just talk like there's one. The lady has an illegitimate child. She's slept around.' Reuben: 'I don't believe this. Are we in the union business or are we in the character assassination business...Do you know that this woman has broken her ass for this organization? She doesn't see her kids. She doesn't have time to take a bath...Get the hell out of here!' He shows them the door.The O.P. Henley management posts a letter saying the black workers are going to take over the union. A group of white thugs beat up a black mill-worker. Several black men come to his defense, and a fight breaks out between black and white mill-workers. Norma calls Reuben. 'We can take legal action,' he says. He asks Norma for a copy of the letter. She can't do that. 'How good is your memory?' 'I still don't know the pledge of allegiance to the flag.' Reuben: Get someone to help you. Write it down a line at a time.Norma tries to memorize the letter but can't. Reuben is furious. 'Don't tell me you can't remember. You walk up to it. You stand there. You copy it down, word for word, line for line. You get me the date. You get me the signature. You get it all and you get it back here to me.' At the mill, Norma, with pencil and paper, copies the letter. Two managers tell her to stop; more managers gather around until she's surrounded by seven men. One manager, Mr. Mason (Noble Willingham) sticks his face mere inches from hers: 'You stop what you're doing. Right. Now.' She defiantly continues copying the letter.When Norma's done, Mason summons her to his office. 'Lady, I want you off the premises. Now!..I want you outta here right quick.' Norma refuses to leave. She brushes past the other managers, into the factory floor, among the other workers. She screams above the din of the machinery. 'It's gonna take you, the police department, and the fire department, and the National Guard to get me out of here! I'll wait for the sheriff to come and take me home. And I ain't gonna budge until he gets here. She jumps up on a table, writes 'UNION' on a piece of cardboard, and holds it with both hands high above her head. The workers stop to see what's going on. Norma's mother shuts down her machine. One by one the workers turn off their machines until the mill is dead quiet.Sheriff Lamar Miller escorts Norma off the premises. There is a police car waiting outside. Norma realizes she's not going home, but to jail, and puts up a fight. Several policemen carry Norma, kicking and screaming, to the car, and throw her into the back seat. At the station, Norma is booked. Charge: Disorderly Conduct. Norma has one phone call-- 'You can call Sonny.' 'I'll be calling my union organizer.'Reuben bails Norma out and drives her home. She immediately wakes up the kids and sits them down in the living room. You kids are going to be hearing a lot of things about me, she says, but 'you're going to hear it from me first.' She tells them she loves them, and who their fathers are. 'If you go in the mill, I want life to be better for you than it is for me. That's why I joined up with the union, and that's why I got fired for it...Now, you kids, you know what I am. And you know that I believe in standing up for what I think is right.' She kisses each one of them and sends them back to bed. She leaves to take a bath, and Sonny and Reuben are left alone in the living room. Sonny: She had one call, and she called you. Reuben: She knew I could make bail. Sonny: You come in here, you mix her up, you turn her all around...She's all changed...What's gonna happen to us now? Reuben: She's a free woman. Maybe you can live with it, maybe you can't. He turns and leaves.Norma is in bed. Sonny enters. 'Did you ever sleep with him?' 'No. But he's in my head.' Sonny: 'I'm gonna see you through getting tired, getting sick, getting old. I'm gonna see you through anything that comes up. And there's nobody else in my head. Just you.' He turns the light off and lies down, his back to her.The ballots are counted. 'Folks, ballots tabulated for the O.P. Henley Company. Against the union, 373. The count for the union, 427.' The workers erupt in cheers, hugs and tears, and chant: 'U-nion! U-nion! U-nion! U-nion!' Outside, beyond the fence, Reuben and Norma hear the cheers. They walk towards Reuben's little car, crammed with union materials. Reuben: What're you gonna do now? Norma Rae: Live. What else? At the car, parked directly in front of the O.P. Henley Company sign, Reuben says, 'I don't say goodbye. I have been known to cry.' 'Well, what do you say?' 'Be happy. Be well.' 'Same to you.' 'Best wishes don't seem hardly enough. I'd like to thank you. I thank you for your companionship, your stamina, your horse sense, and 101 laughs. I also enjoyed very much looking at your shining hair and your shining face.' 'Reuben, I think you like me.' 'I do.' 'I was gonna buy you a tie clip, or shaving lotion or something, but I didn't know what you'd like.' 'Norma, what I've had from you has been sumptuous.' He extends his right hand. She takes it. They look into each other's eyes for what seems like an eternity. He gets into his car. She watches him drive away, and is left standing alone in front of the O.P. Henley Textile Mill building."

The secretary/music director for the church, Anne (Susan Clark), is wary of the changes Hill intends to implement. Hill wants to get people involved, and asks the elderly Mrs. Rose Rafferty (Patsy Kelly) to handle the church's sinking fund.On his first Sunday, Hill learns from Mrs. Rafferty that her gambling husband Delaney (Douglas Fowley) bet all the sinking fund money on a horse race. Hill delivers a sermon less than 15 seconds long, then rapidly escorts Mrs. Rafferty out the church as astonished worshipers watch. She leads him to the bookie, hidden behind a dry-cleaning shop, and meets Harry the Hat (Alan Hale, Jr.), who recommends that Hill let the bet ride. Hill's horse loses and he is thrown out of the betting parlor. Hill summons the police, but the booking joint has been skillfully removed.That evening, Hill delivers a tirade against the organized crime in the city during a local television broadcast. He is chastised by his presbytery superiors for the tirade, and is urged to go out and build church membership in the area. His only success is with a rock band called Strawberry Shortcake, who he recruits to ""jazz up"" the music at church. As a result, Anne resigns as music director.A few days later, two treasury agents for the US government arrive: Marvin Fogleman (Michael Constantine) and Tom Voohries (Steve Franken). They want Hill to help them close down the town's gambling racket by recruiting some men from the church to place bets that the agents will watch. Hill cannot find any men to help, but hits upon the idea of using women. Hill calls together five women from the church whom include; Rose Rafferty; single mother Vicki Simms (Barbara Harris); man-hungry divorcee Claire Porter (Cloris Leachman); bride-to-be and career woman Jane Adams (Karen Valentine); and Cleo Jackson (Virgina Capers), who's husband owns a mechanic garage.Over the next day, the five women attempt to place bets in the company of the Treasury agents, but with disastrous clumsiness as their covers are blown due to their ineptness and bad luck.The team changes tactics to try to go after the ""bank"" that the gangsters use, tailing the mob's deliverymen through town while Hill coordinates using a map at the church office and keeping in touch by CB radio in the ladies cars. Delaney is forced to dress up as a woman to accompany his Rose since his wife does not drive. But after a few days of loosing the delivery car, two gangsters subsequently appear at the church during services and identify the women.Anne discovers the operation, even as Hill defends the Irregulars as keeping the gangsters off balance. After Hill refuses to back down from calling off the operation, Anne resigns from the secretary position. Later that night, the gangsters bomb the church.Hill is shocked at the gangsters' act, and seems ready to give in, but to his surprise, Anne wants to join the fight. They do so, and continue to hammer the gangsters' movements around town. Meanwhile, Hill receives word that the pulpit has been declared vacant and North Avenue will be discontinued as a church entity.Dr. Victor Fulton (Herb Voland), a representative from presbytery, arrives to discuss the closure with Hill. Anne picks up two more presbytery representatives at the airport whom are Dr. Rheems (Ruth Buzzi) and Rev. Samuels. But while driving them to the church, she recognizes one of the mob's deliverymen in a passing trailer and realizes she may be able to find the bank. She tracks the deliveryman to an isolated warehouse compound. Within minutes, all the Irregulars besiege the place as the gangsters attempt a frantic escape with their bank. A ""demolition derby"" ensues, the crooks are stopped, and the evidence is seized.The following Sunday, Hill's congregation gathers outside the gutted church while he delivers news of the indictments against the mob and of the closing of the church. However, Dr. Fulton steps in to proclaim that North Avenue has a new lease on lifeit will be rebuilt. The youthful band starts the music again as everyone rejoices."

His boss, Renfield, informs him that a nobleman named Count Dracula wishes to buy a property in Wismar, and assigns Harker to visit the count and complete the lucrative deal. Leaving his young wife Lucy behind in Wismar, Harker travels for four weeks to Transylvania, to the castle of Count Dracula. He carries with him the deeds and documents needed to sell the house to the Count.On his journey, Jonathan stops at a village, where locals plead for him to stay clear of the accursed castle, providing him with details of Dracula's vampirism. Harker ignores the villagers' pleas as superstition, and continues his journey unassisted ascending the Borgo Pass. Harker arrives at Dracula's castle, where he meets the Count, a strange, ancient, almost rodent-like man, with large ears, pale skin, sharp teeth, and long fingernails.The lonely Count is enchanted by a small portrait of Lucy and immediately agrees to purchase the Wismar property, especially with the knowledge that he and Lucy would become neighbors. As Jonathan's visit progresses, he is haunted at night by a number of dream-like encounters with the vampiric Count. Simultaneously, in Wismar, Lucy is tormented by night terrors, plagued by images of impending doom. Additionally, Renfield is committed to an asylum after biting a cow, apparently having gone completely insane. To Harker's horror, he finds the Count asleep in a coffin, confirming for him that Dracula is indeed a vampire.At night, Dracula leaves for Wismar, taking with him a number of coffins, filled with the cursed earth that he needs for his vampiric rest. Harker finds that he is locked in the castle, and attempts to escape through a window with a makeshift rope. The rope, fashioned from bedsheets, is not long enough, and Jonathan falls, severely injuring himself. He awakes on the ground the next morning, stirred by the sound of a young gypsy boy playing a violin. He is eventually sent to a hospital and raves about 'black coffins' to doctors, who then assume that the sickness is affecting his mind.Meanwhile, Dracula and his coffins travel to Wismar by ship, via the Black Sea port of Varna, thence through the Bosphorus and Gibraltar straits and around the entire west European Atlantic coast to the Baltic Sea. He systematically kills the entire crew, making it appear as if they were afflicted with plague.The ghost ship arrives, with its cargo, at Wismar, where doctors including Abraham Van Helsing investigate the strange fate of the ship. They discover a log that mentions their perceived affliction with plague. In turn, Wismar is flooded with rats from the ship. Dracula arrives in Wismar with his coffins, and death spreads rapidly throughout the town.When Jonathan is finally transported home, he is desperately ill, and does not appear to recognize his wife. Lucy later has an encounter with Count Dracula; weary and unable to die, he demands some of the love that she gave so freely to Jonathan, but she refuses, much to Dracula's dismay. Now aware that something other than plague is responsible for the death that has beset her once-peaceful town, Lucy desperately tries to convince the townspeople, but they are skeptical and uninterested. She finds that she can vanquish Dracula's evil by distracting him at dawn, but at the expense of her own life. She lures the Count to her bedroom, where he proceeds to drink her blood.Lucy's beauty and purity distract Dracula from the call of the rooster, and at the first light of day, he collapses to the floor, dead. Van Helsing arrives to discover Lucy, dead but victorious. He then drives a stake through the heart of the Count to make sure Lucy's sacrifice was not in vain.In a final, chilling plot twist, Jonathan Harker awakens from his sickness, now a vampire, and arranges for Van Helsing's arrest for the murder of Count Dracula. He is last seen traveling away on horseback, garbed in the same fluttering black as Dracula, stating enigmatically that he has much to do."

tt0079688,"['Crime', 'Drama']","Carl (Michael Kramer) and his friends, Ritchie (Matt Dillon), Claude (Tom Fergus), and Johnny (Tiger Thompson) are hanging out at The Rec, a recreation center for the kids in New Grenada, a planned community full of condominiums and town homes. The Rec is pretty much the only thing in town for the children, as the Homeowners Association totally forgot about the fact that nearly 25% of the population of New Grenada is under the age of 15. So, naturally, the kids find themselves some other ways to have fun; sex, drugs, alcohol, vandalism, and rock n roll. One of the first scenes shown is Mark Perry (Vincent Spano), and his friend shooting his B.B. gun at oncoming cars on the overpass. However, when they hit a police cruiser, they laugh and cheer, and decide to leave before the cop sees them. They hop on their bikes, and ride down the road, passing Carl and Ritchie, who, when warned by the boys about cops, dive into the weeds behind an electric control box. The police car pulls up, and out steps Sgt. Doberman (Harry Northup), the most hated cop in town. He sees the boys, and, upon frisking them, finds a three-inch pocketknife on Ritchie. He take the boys to the station, and calls Carl's father, Fred Willat (Andy Romano), warning him about Carl's behavior.Fred is the local Cadillac salesman, an upper middle class job. Before getting Doberman's call, is talking to Jerry Cole (Richard Jamison), president of the Homeowners Association, about getting Mr. Sloan (Lane Smith), a wealthy Texas Landowner, to come to see the land across the street from The Rec, with hopes of building an industrial park there. Back at the police station, Doberman is questioning Ritchie and Carl about who had the gun, and Ritchie tells them that he has only 1 law; A kid who tells on another kid is a dead kid. Ritchie is then taken out of the room, and Doberman continues lecturing Carl about where hes going to end up if he keeps this up; The Hill, a correction center for the kids in the area. Then Carl and his father drive home, where Sandra Willat (Ellen Geer), waits. But instead of talking to his mother, Carl runs upstairs, and locks himself in his room, blaring the Cheap Trick.The next day at school, Carl and Ritchie tell Claude about their escapades with the police, and Claude announces that he took speed to prepare for the upcoming test. He then looks at a slide of a painting, and instead of seeing the actual painting he sees this mangled, horrid thing. Then they go to an assembly about the recent vandalism on the highway, where Carl gets a look at the love of his life, Cory (Pamela Ludwig), who hes absolutely crazy about. Later, after school, Carl is getting dressed to go out, once again listening to his music, only this time, its The Ramones. When Carl is dressed, he goes downstairs and asks his father about the land across from The Rec. but, upon getting an answer different from what he wanted, leaves for The Rec.The Rec closes at six o'clock p.m., but that doesn't stop the kids from having fun. The kids bring pot, music, and alcohol to The Rec after hours, and have their own little party, where Claude ends up buying a gram of hash from Tip (Eric Lalich), a friend. But the party moves when an announcement about a party at a boys house is made. The party is your basic teens; sex, drugs, beer, and Van Halen. Carl sees Cory on the couch making out with Mark, the boy who shot the cop car, and got Carl and Ritchie busted. Mark then warns Carl about mentioning his name to the cops, and when Carl gives a sarcastic remark, he leaves. Carl gets upset with Cory, telling her that she could do a lot better than Mark. Carl then leaves, followed (unknowingly) by Mark and his friend. While Carl is walking home alone, they jump him, beat him up, and take his money. When Carl gets home, he tries to avoid his parents seeing the cuts and bruises, but fails. Carl gets questioned, but, when refusing to tell them who jumped him, runs upstairs and locks himself in his room. Fred and Jerry Cole then talk about making sure The Rec is closed the next day, when Sloan comes to visit.The next day at The Rec, everyone is talking about Carl's event. But he only releases the names to Claude, Ritchie, Johnny, and Alan (Brian Parker), another friend of theirs. While they're talking, Julia (Julia Pomeroy), The Rec counselor, goes outside to talk to Doberman about The Rec staying open. Doberman goes inside and searches Claude, finding the gram of hash in his pocket, and taking him in. However, when they walk outside, Ritchie is standing on the cop car, and makes the cops chase him around the grounds. When the cops finally leave, Carl, and Ritchie go to get sodas, where Ritchie gives Carl firecrackers. They then get on their bikes and ride around the neighborhood, where they find Cory and her best friend Abby (Kim Kliner) running out of a house, carrying a plastic bag. They stop them, and grab the bag, finding a gun in it, which the girls stole from the house. They then all go to a half-finished town home, which Carl and Ritchie call their condo. After planning a picnic with a gun Cory gets up and starts dancing, with the gun in her hand, pointing it at Carl playfully. But the gun goes off, and Carl scares everyone into thinking he is shot. The group then goes their separate ways. When Carl gets home, he sees Sloan's car in the driveway, and, upset at his father, places the firecrackers given to him by Ritchie in the cars engine, so that when the car is turned on, they will light. Sloan and his boys, scared, then leave, but not before warning Fred that if he doesn't stop to listen to his son, it will come back to bite him.The next day, Carl calls Claude and Johnny, telling them to come to the picnic. They all show up, and after shooting the gun, and realizing that Carl is the only one with any sense of aim at all, they start walking. During the walk, Claude tells them that it was Tip who sold him the hash, and Cory announces that Tip had recently gotten busted for possession. They then decide to pay Tip a visit, and while the boys hold Tip down and interrogate him, the girls ransack his kitchen. Tip tells them that he told Doberman who he sold the hash to, because he was arrested. Ritchie then points the gun at him, and Johnny lights a firecracker, making a gun sound. Before leaving, the boys throw Tip in the water under his porch. Before Cory and Abby leave Carl and Ritchie, Cory runs over to Carl and gives him a kiss, showing him that she likes him as much as he likes her.When Carl gets home, he is told by his mother and father that he is forbidden to see Claude or Ritchie any longer, and that The Rec will be closed. Carl gets in a fight with his father, and when Carl takes a swing at him, he smacks him across the face, causing him to, once again, lock himself in his room. The next day at school, in science class, Carl sees Tips mother (Irene Lalich), and the schools principal (Molly McCarthy) talking in a connected classroom. Tips mother tells the principal the names of the boys that assaulted her son, and this causes Carl to snap. He then grabs Ritchie in the hallway and they run home. Ritchie grabs his gun, and they steal his mothers car, leaving town. However, Doberman sees them leave, and chases them. During the chase, Carl begs Ritchie to throw the gun out of the car, but he refuses. The car then gets flipped over, the two boys running in opposite directions. Ritchie points the gun at Doberman, who mistakes it for loaded, so Doberman shoots and kills Ritchie. Carl then runs away to his condo, but not before calling Johnny to confirm that Ritchie is really dead, and calling Cory to tell her to meet him. She brings a sleeping bag, and they spend the night together. After Cory leaves in the morning, Carl runs home to grab money, and along the way he sees Mark riding his dirt bike. He takes Marks B.B. gun, and shoots him in the shoulder (not harming him), causing him to flip over his bike. Mark then sits down with Carl, talking about what they're going to do about the parent situation. They then decide that their fight was stupid, and they make up. Then Carl goes home, and upon climbing into the house through an upstairs window, he sees his mother on the phone with his father about a big meeting at the school that night, to talk about the new trend of violence with the children. He then locks himself in his mothers room, and gets on the phone, asking his parents if they wish he got shot, too.After leaving his home that night, Carl goes to The Rec, where, all of his friends are. They then make a plan to show the parents that they need to listen to them; lock them in the schools auditorium, and wreck the school. Carl climbs onto the roof, entering the school through a sun window above a science classroom. The kids then take their bike chains and lock the gates surrounding the auditorium. The children decide that the only thing that will make them feel better is to trash the school, and all of the cars in the parking lot. However, when they find guns, all hell breaks loose. The kids run around shooting cars, causing massive explosions. When Cory almost gets blown up by an explosion caused by Mark, and cant find Carl, Claude and Johnny agree to take her home, but not before Johnny gives a phone to Julia, who is sitting by a gate in the school. Julia calls the police, and as soon as they hear sirens, all of the kids split, some getting arrested. The police unlock the auditorium doors, and Doberman runs out to find Carl. He gets in a cop car, and drives down the road until he finds Carl. He handcuffs him to the backseat, and tells him that he will have to go to The Hill. But, Mark is waiting down the road with his B.B. gun, and shoots the car, causing Doberman to run it off the road, into, of all buildings, The Rec. Doberman gets knocked out, and The Rec catches on fire. Carl grabs Dobermans keys, and unlocks himself from the car. He runs away, and stops and turns around just in time to see The Rec blow up. He then for sure knows that Doberman died.The final scene shows Carl in the morning, coming handcuffed out of the police station. Carl stops and hugs his parents, and is then escorted onto a bus (full of other kids involved with the school incident, including Mark and Abby) by Lincoln (Mike Osborne), another police officer. He is sat at the back of the bus, and driven down the highway to The Hill. But, when they go under the overpass, (the same one that Mark was shooting off of earlier) they see Claude, Johnny, and Cory waving from above. Carl then turns around to face the front of the bus, quite content with the fact that his friends are safe, and that Cory still loves him."

Reggie, a family man and ice cream vendor, joins the brothers in their suspicions that the local mortician, dubbed ""The Tall Man"", is responsible for the deaths.Mike relays his fears to a fortuneteller and her granddaughter about the possibility of Jody departing and leaving him in the care of his aunt, along with his suspicions about The Tall Man. Mike is shown a small black box and told to put his hand into it. After the box grips his hand, Mike is told by the granddaughter not to be afraid and as the panic subsides, the box relaxes its grip. The notion of fear itself as the killer is established and is what propels Mike towards his final confrontation in the film with The Tall Man.Fearing that Jody will abandon him, Mike follows him one evening to a local bar where he sees him pick up the woman in lavender from the opening scene and follows them to the Morningside Cemetery where Jody and the woman make out with each other. Just then, Mike is scared from his hiding place when a small figure wearing a brown robe jumps out at him. Jody, alerted by Mike's scream, finds him and angrily tells him to go home. When Jody returns to the make out spot, the mysterious woman in lavender is also gone.Mike begins to have horrifying nightmares about the Tall Man and of his dwarf-like minions and determines that something is going on at Morningside Mortuary. After an encounter when he is pinned under a car when one of the dwarfs drops a car on him while he is working in the garage, Mike decides to investigate.The next evening, he goes out, armed with a hunting knife, to Morningside Mortuary and breaks into the building through a basement window. Mike hides when the Tall Man and the cemetery caretaker are seen. Walking down a long hallway at the mortuary, Mike encounters a flying silver sphere, about the size of a softball, coming right at him. The caretaker appears and grabs Mike as the flying sphere comes right at him. Mike ducks in time as the sphere hits the caretaker and drills into his head, spurting out blood. Mike then encounters the Tall Man who chases him to the basement where Mike manages to sever some of the fingers of the Tall Man's right hand. Mike escapes from the mortuary and from two of the Tall Man's brown-robed dwarf minions and runs for home.The next morning, Mike shows Jody the severed finger of the Tall Man which is still twitching with life and bleeding yellow embalming fluid, which Mike is keeping in a small box. When Reggie comes over, and Mike shows them the severed finger, it transforms into a large wasp-like insect which attacks the three of them, but Jody manages to kill it by shoving it into the kitchen garbage disposal.The next evening, Jody goes to Morningside Mortuary to investigate, armed with a .45 caliber pistol, but he is immediately attacked by one of the brown-robed dwarfs in the mortuary basement, forcing him to run. Jody runs into Mike outside the cemetery driving their car when they are chased by a hearse being driven by one of the dwarfs. Jody opens fire on the hearse with his shotgun and forces it off the road. Upon examining the dwarf driver, the two brothers are shocked to find that it is a former friend of theirs (murdered by the woman in lavender in the opening scene) now crushed down to small size.Jody and Mike call Reggie who takes the still alive body of their friend into Reggie's ice cream truck while Jody drops Mike off at a local antique store. There, Mike finds an old photo of the Tall Man in an 19th Century photo during the founding of the town. Mike asks the two young store workers, Sally and Sue, to drive him home. During the drive, Mike tells them to stop the car when they see Reggie's overturned ice cream truck lying beside the road. Mike looks around and finds that the creature dwarf has escaped and Reggie is nowhere to be found. Just then, a group of dwarfs attack Mike and the girls who take control of their car and drives away, while Mike falls out the rear window.Mike goes home and tells Jody about Reggie's disappearance and about the recent attack. Jody decides to go back to the mortuary to look for Reggie and the two girls, and Mike wants to come along. But Jody instead locks him in his room, feeling that it would be too dangerous. Mike, using a buckshot shell, manages to disable the lock on his door and takes a pistol from the house to meet up with Jody, but the Tall Man is waiting for him outside (with his hand fully healed) and forcibly takes Mike into his waiting hearse to drive back to the cemetery. Mike manages to shoot out a tire from the car as it arrives at the mortuary which goes out of control. Mike manages to jump out of the car before it hits a tree and explodes, with the Tall Man still inside.Inside the mortuary, Jody is breaking into a crypt of his parents to find if their bodies are still there. Mike enters the building minutes later and sees his parents unearthed coffins and upon opening one, and finds that they are empty. Mike runs and has another encounter with the lethal flying silver sphere, until Jody shows up and destroys the silver sphere with a blast from his shotgun. The two brothers then encounter Reggie, who claims that he made it to the mortuary and has been hiding in a coffin for the past few hours. Reggie also claims to have found the missing girls in a room and freed them.Mike, Jody, and Reggie then go into another room which is a large open area, filled with storage barrels containing several dwarfs, as well as two long poles which upon close examination, is the gateway to an alien planet. Mike is briefly sucked through, but saved by Jody and Reggie who pull him back. Mike realizes that the Tall Man is using the corpses as slaves to his alien planet, and they have to be crushed to small size because of the planet's intense gravity and heat. When the lights in the building go off, Mike disappears and Jody sets off to find him.Alone in the small room, Reggie decides on a gamble to shut down the humming two-pronged gateway by slamming his hands on the tops of the poles, creating a vacuum which he barely escapes. Outside the mortuary, Reggie encounters the woman in lavender, who stabs him to death with the dagger. Mike and Jody come upon the scene and discover the woman in lavender, who changes into the Tall Man, yet another replica. Mike and Jody are forced to run as the mortuary glows and is apparently destroyed.Back home, Mike and Jody, distraught over the death of Reggie, and that the entire town is either dead or consumed by the gateway vacuum, plot on a way to stop the Tall Man by trapping him in a mine shaft since there seems to be no way of killing him. While Jody sneaks out of the house to go to a remote area near a mine shaft to prepare the trap, the Tall Man arrives at the house and attacks Mike who is forced to run. The chase leads to the mine where the Tall Man falls through a fake ground into the hole and to the bottom where Joey pushes a large boulder to seal the hole, thus trapping the Tall Man.After doing so successfully, Mike suddenly wakes up with a start in his house. Mike is next seen lying by the fireplace with the alive-and-well Reggie sitting next to him.Reggie tells Mike he was simply having a bad dream, something that has been a common occurrence since Jody died in a car crash a few weeks earlier. Mike realizes that Jody is indeed dead as well as his parents... all of whom died in the car accident, and the whole thing with the Tall Man was nothing but his horrible nightmare. Reggie suggests that they go away for a while, and Mike agrees.Mike goes into his room to pack his stuff where the Tall Man is waiting for him behind his door. After Mike is shocked to see the Tall Man behind his door, several arms of the dwarf minions pulls Mike through his bedroom window as he screams...."

tt0079813,"['Comedy', 'Music']","The school board meets to welcome Miss Evelyn Togar (Mary Woronov), Vince Lombardi High School's new principal -- the old principal having been driven insane by the unruly students. Riff Randell (P.J. Soles) and her nerdy friend Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) hijack the PA system to play some music (""Sheena Is a Punk Rocker""). Miss Togar interupts the dance party and gives them both detention. Miss Togar then announces to the assembled students that Vince Lombardi High School has the worst academic standing in California. Three principals in a row have suffered nervous breakdowns because the student body cares about nothing but rock and roll music. Miss Togar vows to the students that she will clean up the school and make it a center of learning. Intimidated, the kids rush off to their classes.Kate has a crush on the quarterback, Tom Roberts (Vincent Van Patten), who has the hots for Riff. Tom is shy with girls -- all he can think of to talk about is the weather -- so rather than ask Riff out, he goes to see the school's fixer, Eaglebauer (Clint Howard), who has an office in the boys' restroom. Eaglebauer agrees to get Tom a date with Riff. His task becomes complicated the very next day when Kate asks him to get her a date with Tom.Riff, an aspiring singer and songwriter, has written a song called ""Rock 'n' Roll High School"" for her favorite band, the Ramones. Her heart belongs to lead singer Joey Ramone, and she hopes that one day she'll be able to give the song to Joey and that the band will record it.Miss Togar sends her two geek minions, hall monitors Fritz Hansel (Loren Lester) and Fritz Gretel (Daniel Davies), to summon Mr. McGree (Paul Bartel), the music teacher, and Coach Steroid (Alix Elias), the gym teacher, to the science lab. Togar has been researching the effects of rock music. She shares her findings with Mr. McGree and Coach Steroid, and performs a demonstration: Ramones music played at high decibel levels makes mice explode. Meanwhile the girls' gym class, left unsupervised, is rocking out to unauthorized music -- Riff singing along to her demo tape of ""Rock 'n' Roll High School"". Fritz Hansel and Fritz Gretel happen by and rat the girls out, but before Togar arrives, the class goes back to the boring calisthenics they were supposed to be doing.In the girls' locker room, Riff announces that the Ramones are coming to town to give a concert and she plans to go. The other girls, though enthusiastic, can't take time away from school to wait in the ticket line for three days. Riff resolves to get tickets for everyone.At the concert hall, Riff is first in line. She sets up a folding lounge chair and settles in to wait. Back at school, Kate gives Miss Togar notes with increasingly implausible excuses to cover for Riff's absence: the death of her mother, the death of her father, and the death of her goldfish. (Hansel and Gretel disprove this excuse by producing the goldfish, which seems perfectly healthy until one of them swallows it.) The ticket line gets longer and a groupie, Angel Dust (Lynn Farrell), cuts in front of Riff to claim the first place in line. Their argument is interrupted by the arrival of the Ramones in a big old convertible, singing ""I Just Want to Have Something to Do."" The band's manager recognizes Angel Dust and invites her to come in with the band, much to Riff's chagrin.When the ticket window finally opens, Riff buys 100 tickets and later distributes them at school. Miss Togar gets wind of the concert and demands that Riff and Kate surrender their tickets. When they refuse, Togar lets the hall monitors take the tickets by force (""body search!""). Disheveled and despondent at the prospect of missing the concert, the girls retreat to Riff's house to do homework.Meanwhile, Eaglebauer is with Tom in Tom's tricked-out van, coaching him on how to ask Riff for a date. Tom calls just as Kate confesses to Riff that she thinks Tom will soon ask her (Kate) out. Kate is furious when Riff agrees to go out with Tom, but Riff assures her that she only accepted so she can fix up Tom and Kate.In Riff's car, Kate and Riff hear a DJ giving away a pair of Ramones tickets on the radio. Frantic to win the tickets, Riff pulls the car over and they pull a man out of a phone booth (the poor guy's proposing to his girlfriend) so they can use the phone. When they hear they've won, Riff calls Tom to break their date and the girls rush back to Riff's place to dress for the show.That evening, concert-goers file into the club, which is growing crowded. The kindly Mr. McGree attends out of curiosity, but his outdated idea of cool clubwear (a '50s-era beret and a '60s-era scarf) elicits some snickers. A large white mouse is denied admission -- the staff is afraid the music will cause him to explode -- until he produces a pair of noise-canceling headphones. An Indian chief in full feathered headdress is also attending.Riff and Kate are introduced on stage by the DJ who ran the ticket contest, Screamin' Steve Stevens (Don Steele). Offered the chance to say a few words to the crowd and the radio audience (which includes Miss Togar), Riff says ""On behalf of the students from Vince Lombardi High who are here tonight, I'd just like to say one thing: Screw you, Principal Togar, we made it to the concert anyway!""Screamin' Steve tries to get Riff and Kate backstage to meet the band, but the Ramones' manager isn't having any, and tells Angel Dust, the groupie, to see the girls back to their seats. The crowd is revved up and shouting ""hey, ho! let's go!"" when the band takes the stage to open with ""Blitzkrieg Bop."" Riff has to encourage Kate to get into it, but Kate begins to loosen up and enjoy herself during the next song, ""Teenage Lobotomy."" During the following number, ""California Sun,"" Angel attempts to steal the song Riff wrote. Tom, who has come to the concert with Eaglebauer, chases her and gets hold of the package when Angel trips over a cokehead who's spilled his powder on the floor. Riff offhandedly thanks Tom for his help and runs back to the concert. Tom sees that only Kate really cares about him and they agree to be friends. Back on stage, Joey (reading a note from Riff) dedicates the next song, ""She's the One,"" to Tom and Kate.At the same time Miss Togar's minions, Hansel and Gretel, crash the concert looking for Riff. Instead they find Angel Dust in the Ramones' dressing room. When Angel Dust mouths off to them, they yell ""body search!"" and attack her. Riff eventually gets backstage to give Joey her song.A few days later, Miss Togar and several concerned parents hold a rally where they try to burn a pile of Ramones records in front of the school. Riff and Tom throw a bowl of water at the bonfire and at Miss Togar. When most of the students begin to riot, the Ramones arrive and all the students cheer for them. Taking over the group, Riff, Tom, Kate, Eaglebauer and others storm the school and throw a large climactic party. Mr. McGree, finally seeing the ruthless and authoritarian figure that Miss Togar has become, defects and joins the students -- and the party -- in the school. Hansel and Gretel sneak in to stop the party, but when they're discovered hiding in a laundry cart, the Ramones themselves push the cart out of a third floor window. Miss Togar's henchmen end up in bandages and casts with multiple injuries.During the party, Riff announces that the Ramones are honorary members of the student body. The Ramones give Riff a Ramones jacket and makes her an honorary member of their band. The band plays ""Do You Wanna Dance"" while Kate and Tom dance together and make out, having found love at last. The students proceed to party and wreck most of the building with the loud music.But that evening, a furious Miss Togar calls the police and the building is surrounded by riot officers led by Chief Klein (Dick Miller). When Miss Togar, speaking through a bullhorn, demands that the students stop the festivities, Riff responds by destroying all the mid-term exams and all the student records with a chainsaw. More angry than ever, Miss Togar and Chief Klein threaten to storm the building with tear gas unless the students exit the premises within five minutes.With few options left, Kate and Eaglebauer devise a bomb in the laboratory. Aware that their party is finally over, the Ramones, Riff, Kate, Tom, Eaglebauer, Mr. McGree, and all the students quietly file out of the building where the riot police are poised to attack. Riff steps forward and tells Miss Togar that if she wants to have her school back, she can. When a surprised Togar asks Riff what she would have done with the school anyway, Riff says ""Rock the roof off it! Hit it, Marky!"" -- and the band launches into Riff's song, ""Rock 'n' Roll High School."" The students and Ramones resume their party and Riff detonates the bomb. The school explodes spectacularly.As Vince Lombardi High School burns, fire trucks arrive. The students are led away, still happy and partying, to police buses waiting to take them to jail, while Miss Togar is taken away in an ambulance in a straight-jacket mumbling ""detention"" over and over. She has become the latest principle to be carted away to a mental hospital."
tt0079817,"['Drama', 'Sport']","Picking up immediately after the events in the first Rocky movie, Rocky II begins with the events of 14th round of the Bicentennial New Years Day fight from the first movie. The fight lasts the entire 15 rounds with each fighter suffering many devastating injuries. After the fight, Rocky calls out for Adrian, who runs down to the ring. As Creed is announced the winner by split decision, Adrian and Rocky embrace, and Rocky tells her that he loves her.After their championship bout, Rocky (Sylvester Stalone) and Apollo (Carl Weathers) are taken by ambulance to Pennsylvania Hospital in Center City (a WCAU-TV Channel 10 news truck follows behind the ambulance), where they meet once again in the hospital lobby with a mob of reporters. Apollo Creed, who retained the championship on points, is furious at Rocky, the first man to go the distance with him, and starts clamoring for another chance to knock Rocky out. Rocky is taken into surgery where the doctor will fix his broken nose. He tells Rocky he may need eye surgery to repair a detached retina.Rocky goes to Apollo's room that night and asks ""Did you give me your best?"" to which Apollo answers ""Yeah."" Rocky declines talk of a rematch and tells Apollo that he is quitting boxing.Following his hospital stay, Rocky proposes to Adrian (Talie Shire) in front of the tiger paddock at the Philadelphia Zoo, and they later get married in a private church ceremony. Rocky begins to enjoy the profits from his fight with Apollo. He buys his first brand new car, a 1979 Pontiac Trans Am (even though it's still supposedly 1976), goes on a shopping spree (purchasing a black leather jacket with a tiger on the back for himself, a fur coat for Adrian, and some gold wristwatches), and buys a two-story row house in a nicer Philly neighborhood. He also convinces his previous employer, the loan shark Gazzo (Joe Spinell), to give Paulie (Burt Young) his old collecting job. Rocky then opts to earn money by appearing in television commercials. His new career, however, is quickly derailed by his sub-par reading skills, which leads to a clash with the director of his first commercial -- Rocky is unable to read the cue cards while wearing ridiculous costumes to promote a men's cologne. He is rudely dismissed by the director.Over the next few months, Rocky, unable to find white-collar work due to his lack of education beyond the 9th grade, and after being laid off (because of cutbacks) from the meat packing plant where Paulie previously worked, gets a job ""helping out"" as an assistant trainer at Mickey's gym, where the other fighters in training seem to have lost a large amount of respect for him, likely because he lost to Apollo and because he's taken on the job of sweeping the floor and rings and empty the spit buckets. Adrian, now pregnant, returns to her old job at the pet store. Running short on money from his unwise spending spree, Rocky also hands over his new Trans Am car to Paulie, who agrees to take over the insurance payments.Meanwhile, Apollo Creed has been receiving hate mail about his split-decision win over Rocky and is filled with anger and frustration: the letters alternately accuse him of deliberately carrying ""that chump"" (Rocky) the distance or state outright that he should have lost and has no business calling himself the champ. Determined to prove himself and win back the respect of his fans, Apollo elects to try and pressure Rocky into another fight, despite protests from his trainer, Tony ""Duke"" Evers, to find a new contender to fight against (when asked by Apollo what Tony is afraid of, Tony replies ""He's all wrong for us. I saw you beat that man like I ain't never seen no man get beat before. And the man kept coming after you.""). Rocky himself begins to have second thoughts about the fight, but because of the pressure applied by Apollo, Rocky decides to accept the challenge for a rematch against Apollo on Thanksgiving 1976 and begins training once again.Mickey is angrily unwilling to train Rocky at first, due to his bad eye. However, after seeing Apollo making fun of Rocky on public television, he becomes furious and agrees to train Rocky. Mickey decides he wants the left-handed Rocky to learn to fight right-handed in order to better protect the eye, and to give him a surprise advantage by switching back to left-handed with the intention of throwing off Apollo's timing and confusing him. He also focuses on improving Rocky's speed by using an old training method from his own boxing days: he forces Rocky to chase a chicken around a vacant lot, stating, ""If you can catch this thing you can catch greased lightning."" Rocky tells Mickey he feels like an idiot.However, Adrian's opposition saps Rocky's resolve and his training suffers. When Paulie confronts Adrian about her opinion, her angry reaction creates a serious medical condition that breaks her water prematurely. During the birth of their son, Adrian falls into a coma, and as a result of the premature birth, their son is placed into an incubator at the hospital ICU. Rocky breaks away from training to spend every waking moment either at her side or in the hospital chapel with Mickey, not even seeing his newborn son until several days later when she recovers. When Adrian emerges from the coma, she tells Rocky to ""win"" and he restarts training in earnest with Mickey for the rematch with Apollo. His condition improves dramatically with increased strength and speed and Mickey's idea of training Rock as a right-handed fighter. He runs pulling Mickey on a bicycle behind him and finally catches the chicken Mick had him chase, much to his trainer's delight.As with the first fight, Rocky's training includes his famous brisk run throughout the city of Philadelphia. This time, however, he is greeted with the cheers and encouragement of onlookers as he runs through the streets of South Philadelphia, having become a local celebrity following his narrow loss to Apollo. Along the way, children and pre-teens begin to follow him, their numbers increasing dramatically block by block. By the time he reaches the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Center City, hundreds of young people have joined in. Ultimately, they follow Rocky to the top of the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, surrounding him and enthusiastically chanting his name as he lifts his arms in a victory pose.Rocky and Apollo once again fight an intense battle in front of a standing-room-only crowd at the Philadelphia Spectrum. Paulie and a still-recovering Adrian stay home to watch the match on their TV set. Gazzo personally attends the match with a front-row seat as he did during the first match. Unlike the first match, Apollo gets off to a fast start, flooring Rocky twice in the first two rounds and building a huge lead on the scorecards as the fight goes on. But throughout the fight, Rocky pounds away at Apollo on and off, turning the fight into a brutal battle.At the start of the 15th and final round, Apollo's trainer begs him not to try to go for a knockout, as he can win simply by avoiding Rocky. Apollo, desperately wanting to prove he can knock out Rocky and very frustrated that he keeps coming back, disregards the advice. Mickey suddenly tells Rocky to switch back to boxing left-handed, and although Rocky initially refuses, he switches back, landing several crushing lefts. Rocky hits Apollo with a final punch that knocks him down, but from sheer exhaustion, Rocky also goes down to the canvas. The referee starts the final ten-count as the fighters struggle to their feet.At the count of 9, Apollo, finally realizing all but too late that the last fight was not fixed, collapses while reaching for the top rope, while Rocky picks himself up and is declared the victor. In his post-match speech, he thanks Apollo for another hard-fought battle, Mickey for training him, and God. Rocky states ""Except for my kid being born, this is the greatest night in the history of my life, and I just want to say one thing to my wife who's home: Yo, Adrian! I did it!"""

After losing, he suddenly dies.At the reading of his will that Sunday, Charles Bernstein (Robert Morley), Parker's attorney, announces to a room of invited family members and acquaintances that the millionaire recorded an audio message for them. In keeping with his motto, ""play to win,"" the inheritor of Parker's $200 million estate will be decided in a scavenger hunt. Each team will receive an identical list of clues identifying 100 items to obtain, and every item has a different point value. The group or person who earns the most points by 5:00 pm that day will inherit the Parker fortune.The five competing teams consist of the following groups: Mildred Carruthers (Cloris Leechman), Parker's greedy, widowed, dowager sister; Stuart Selsome (Richard Benjamin), her calculating attorney; and Georgie (Richard Masur), her grownup, but childlike son; Parker's nephews, Jeff (Dirk Benedict) and Kenny Stevens (Willie Aames); Parker's son-in-law Henry Motley (Tony Randall) and his four disobedient young children Jennifer, Michelle, Jason and Scott; the millionaire's personal staff of Henri (James Coco), the French chef; Jenkins (Roddy McDowell), the valet; Jackson (Cleavon Little), the chauffeur; and Babbette (Stephanie Faracy), the dim-witted French maid; and Marvin Dummitz (Richard Mulligan), a blundering taxicab driver, who did not know Parker, but inadvertently helped him gain control of the company after being responsible for a car accident years earlier in which Parker's business partner died. Believing she is the sole rightful heir, Mildred is furious about the game. When she refuses to let her stepdaughter Lisa (Maureen Teefy) to compete, Jeff and Kenny invite the young woman to join their team. Before distributing the lists, Bernstein reminds the competitors that items can be acquired by any means, except purchase, and they are to be stored in the assigned pens located on the estate. As soon as the groups receive the list, they speed away in different directions.Mildred, Stuart, and Georgie begin their quest by procuring a teddy bear at a carnival, but their next item proves to be more challenging as they remove a large safe from Stuart's office. After the elevator breaks down, Stuart tries to transport the heavy object down the stairs while George is determined to sabotage the effort. In a moment of good fortune, the safe falls out a window and conveniently lands in the backseat of their car.Next, Stuart notices another item on the list, a fox tail, tied to a parked motorcycle. As he unfastens the object, a biker gang and their leader, ""Scum,"" (Meat Loaf) accost him. Stuart emerges from the beating dazed and with his clothes in tatters, but the greedy and callous Mildred has no sympathy and screams that the 5:00 pm deadline is approaching.Elsewhere, the servants pose as plumbers to detach a toilet, worth 40 points, from a hotel bathroom and steal a cash register from a grocery store, while leaving behind the money. Thanks to the efficient Jenkins, the servants make good progress in the hunt, until they become locked in a chemistry laboratory while foraging for a microscope.Meanwhile, Marvin fumbles at the beginning as he tries several times to steal a Rolls-Royce automobile grille. Next, he breaks into a bridal shop to snatch a gown, but Sam (Scatman Crothers), the elderly security guard, catches him. After Marvin explains that he is the only team with one player in a very high-stakes scavenger hunt, Sam agrees to join him and share in any winnings. At a museum, the two develop a plan to procure a suit of armor: Marvin dresses as a mummy to distract visitors and guards, while Sam sneaks away wearing the metal outfit. However, Sam is knocked unconscious after falling down stairs in the cumbersome suit, with Marvin unaware of his partner's predicament. As Mildred, Stuart, and Georgie arrive at the museum to find the same item, they stumble upon the armored figure lying on the floor and store the body in their car trunk.Elsewhere, Henry and his children have little to show for their scavenging efforts and when their station wagon breaks down after acquiring a parachute from a nearby sky-diving school, Henry appears too tired and discouraged to continue. His bored children, who have thus far been uncooperative, inspire their father to continue, and the family becomes motivated to finally work as team. To secure the next item, a medicine ball, Henry accidentally falls out the second floor window of a gym holding the item. Believing he performed the stunt on purpose, his children have a newfound respect for their father.Also, the fifth team of Kenny, Jeff and Lisa are enjoying the experience. They abscond with a clown head at a Jack in the Box fast food drive-thru restaurant, steal a helmet from the San Diego Chargers football team, and pick up an overweight woman, worth 50 points, at a bus stop. After procuring a tank of nitrous oxide, the ""laughing gas"" leaks in their van and causes a chuckling Jeff to swerve across the road. A policeman stops the trio, but the officer is soon affected by the gas and happily agrees to give the team his uniform, the next item on the list.
While Jeff, Kenny, and Lisa park the van to acquire another object, Mildred and her team steal their loot.Meanwhile, the servants escape from the chemistry lab to discover that Parker's devious sister has also seized their items. A car chase ensues as the nephews and the servants attempt to catch the cheaters, who race back to the Parker estate to claim the objects as their own. With 15 minutes remaining until the deadline, the five teams converge on the estate and place their items in the designated pens. Although the servants and the nephews complain to Bernstein about Mildred's underhanded tactics, the attorney declares that the items are already in her pen, and, therefore no one can remove them. Meanwhile, a zookeeper (Avery Schreiber) arrives to protest that five of his ostriches were stolen for the game. As Mildred and Stuart anticipate their victory, the other teams realize that their only chance to defeat the miscreants is to combine their items. They use Kenny, Jeff, and Lisa's pen to collect the objects.However, with seconds left on the clock, the score of the four teams is 1,365, while Mildred, Stuart, and George remain in first place with 1,480 points. Suddenly, Sam, dressed in full armor, climbs out of Mildred's car trunk and represents the points needed for the coalition to win the game. With encouragement from Marvin, Sam stumbles toward the nephews' pen and secures the $200 million estate for the four teams."
tt0079871,"['Crime', 'Drama']","A young offender is sent to borstal (""reform school"" in American terms) and faces the brutality and indifference of the guards. He manages to work his way to the top of the prisoner heap by his use of violence against the reigning inmates who attempt to intimidate him. The standard response to inmate-on-inmate violence when asked by the guards is ""I fell sir"" - the fear of retaliation is more compelling than any help you might or might not get from the staff. There's a really brutal and realistic rape scene in the garden shed of a younger looking inmate, while a guard looks in through the window, appearing to be enjoying the scene. When asked ""what's all this then?"" he manages to croak out the expected reply, ludicrous given the obviousness of what happened. The victim ends up killing himself as a result, sparking off a riot. another interesting inmate is the intellectual trying to fight the system in his own non-violent way, equally unsuccessfully. Frankly, there's really not a lot of plot, this movie is mostly about the characters and the conditions in places like these that appear to sadly be the same in a lot of different countries and cultures. It is reminiscent of ""Bad Boys"" starring Sean Penn that came out in the US about the same time, which had a bit more plot than this movie, but was equally bleak in it's portrayal of life inside a juvenile offenders prison/borstal/reform school."
tt0079944,"['Drama', 'SciFi']","A ""stalker"" is a guide who takes people through ""The Zone,"" a place located outside an unidentified city, the result of an extra-terrestrial incursion. The State has closed it off from the outside world with barbed wire and it is closely guarded by armed police and soldiers. Inside The Zone there is ""The Room,"" which is said to grant ones deepest wish to anybody who enters it.""Stalker"" opens with the credits rolling on the background showing of a shabby bar. An atmosphere of despair is reinforced by a strange electronic music. Soon after, Professor Wallace tells about the sudden appearance nearby of a miracle of miracle: The Zone.The next scene shows a dingy room where three figures, a man, a woman, and a child, are asleep together in a wrought iron bed. Next to the bed is a pair of crutches. The man slowly gets up, dresses, goes to the kitchen sink and washes himself. The woman, his wife (Alisa Frejndlikh), joins him and scolds him for returning to his old ways, which will surely land him back in jail. The man argues briefly for her to let him go, that he must go, and he finally pushes her aside and leaves the room. As he leaves, his wife curses the day she ever met him and reproaches him for having begotten such a child. She falls to the ground, weeping.The man, Stalker (Aleksandr Kajdanovsky), goes to the waterfront to meet with a couple, a well-dressed woman and a man, Writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn). He rudely dismisses the woman and, together with Writer, walks back to the bar shown in the opening of the film, where a third man, Professor (Nikolai Grinko), is waiting for them. No sooner as these two men meet that they start bickering with each other. Stalker will guide these two men through The Zone. Writer explains that the reason for his trip is to recover his lost inspiration while Professors motivation is purely scientific curiosity.Stalker and the two men leave the bar for their dangerous mission into The Zone. They drive through a desolate urban landscape of broken down and abandoned buildings, littered potholed streets, carefully avoiding police patrols. After sometime, sneaking behind a train, they enter through open gates the buffer area of The Zone. They hide for a while, and following the train again through another check-point, and all the while being shot at, they penetrate into The Zone itself. Having taken refuge in an abandoned building, they regroup, and Stalker sends Writer ahead to look for a railway flatbed car, which will take them inside The Zone itself. Writer loses in nerves and turns around right away, having second thoughts about continuing the trip, so Professor calmly volunteers for the mission.All three men journey on the flatbed car silently and solemnly through changing landscape in a single three-and-a-half minute odyssey to the The Zone. As they reach, the film turns from sepia color to full color. There is a striking contrast between the lush green, but littered landscape of The Zone and the dilapidated surroundings previously encountered. The atmosphere is still except for the calls of cuckoo birds heard in the far. ""There we are... home, at last,"" says Stalker and proceeds to talk about another stalker, his mentor, Porcupine. Before absenting himself for a while, Stalker hands Professor some white cloth and some steel nuts and tells him to tie a piece of this gauze to each of the nuts. During his absence, Professor relates the story of Porcupine and of The Zone. When Stalker rejoins the group, their journey through The Zone begins, with Stalker every so often throwing one of the nuts to indicate the path to follow. All along, Stalker relates how dangerous and tricky The Zone is, and that it demands respect. Rules that apply outside The Zone are no longer valid inside it. For example, the shortest path between two points is no longer a straight line, but a convoluted path. As they soon arrive in view of The Room, Writer rebels against this rule and proceeds straight on toward The Room, but stops short when he hears a voice warning him: ""Stop, don't move."" Writer returns precipitously to Stalker and Professor who swear that they had not spoken a word. Professor suggestion that Writer scared himself starts another argument interrupted by Stalker who again reiterates the danger in The Zone, full of deadly traps, and what kind of persons is allowed to enter The Room. Professor now gets apprehensive and refused to go on, but Stalker dissuades him, and the group continues on.Professor, having forgotten his knapsack, wants to go back to fetch it. Stalker tells him it is impossible because it is too dangerous. Stalker and Writer continue their journey, wading knee-deep toward a waterfall. Arriving at the cascade, Stalker notices that Professor is missing. Since it is not possible to retrace ones path in The Zone, they proceed and as they passed through an archway in a tiled wall, they meet a serene Professor having a drink by a fire, with his knapsack nearby, just where he had previously left it. Stalker recognizes this as a trap. Another argument ensues during which Professor and Writer throw biting insults at each other.A long, puzzling and complex scene follows, during which a mysterious dog appears. This long scene is complex in so far as the positions and the spatial relationships between the three characters keep changing in unnatural ways. The background of electronic music adds to the strangeness of the scene. Writer and Stalker talk about the redemptive power of art. A voice-over, that may be Stalkers wife, recites some biblical passage, and so does Stalker.A quick cut shows the group arriving at the ""meat grinder,"" a dark tunnel, dimly lit through hole in the ceiling, and a floor covered with puddles. Writer is designated in a draw to go first, while the rest of the group follows at a safe distance. When Writer reaches a door, he pulls out a pistol, but Stalker convinces him to throw it away. They continue through the door, wadding chest-deep in filthy water, up a stairway, and into a room filled with moguls of sand. Writer, who had proceeded in the wrong direction, standing next to a deep well where he has just dropped a large stone, delivers a long monologue about the emptiness of his life and the meaninglessness of work. Stalkers deliver a poem, which was actually written by Arseny Tarkovsky, about fate.In the following scene, the trio finds itself in one of the small rooms bordering a pool full of refuse, and in which there is a telephone (note that this is not The Room). A heated discussion begins regarding each of the men's real objectives for wanting to reach The Room. Stalker leads the two men through an opening in the wall and stop at the threshold of a brightly illuminated room, and, chocked with emotions, he tells his companions that they are now about to experience the greatest moment in their lives. In The Room, they will be able to fulfill their most sincere wish.Writer refuses to go in first, as he does not want to humiliate himself by prostrating himself. Professor produces a hand held nuclear bomb he had carried all along in his knapsack, as he does not want the power of The Room to be used by the wrong people for the wrong reasons. Stalker struggles with Professor trying to take the bomb away, with Writer intervening several times, tearing Stalker away from the Professor. Writer brings all sorts of accusations against Stalker, questioning his motives and his honesty. To which a tearful Stalker responds that he is a failure and that all the people he brings to The Room are also failures, but he can nevertheless help them. Eventually, Professor takes his bomb apart and throws the pieces in the water. The last scene shows, the three men sitting on the floor, outside The Room, with Writer, his arm over Stalkers shoulder, and Professor leaning against their backs.In the next scene, in black-and-sepia film, we are back into the bar with the trio standing around the table, almost as at the opening of the film. Outside are Stalkers wife and his daughter, Monkey (Natasha Abramova). The wife enters the bar and leaves together with Stalker and the dog, leaving Professor and Writer behind. Stalker is carrying his daughter on his shoulders. They walk along a river with the power plant in the background belching steam.Once at home, Stalker is very depressed, and his wife reassures him of his worth. Direct to the audience, she delivers a long monologue, saying that in spite of all the adversities she has endured over the years, she does not regret having married Stalker. She professes that their marriage was blessed, because if there would have been no sorrow, there could have been no happiness either.The final shot, in color, is an enigmatic one. Monkey is heard in a voice-over reading a poem by Fyodor Tyuchev. She then appears to move through telekinesis three glasses which are on the table. A train passes, rattling The the, its rambling mixing up with segments of Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy,"" as the film fades away on Monkey's vacant face."
tt0079945,"['Adventure', 'Mystery', 'SciFi']","In Klingon space, three Klingon battle cruisers encounter a huge cloud-like anomaly. On the bridge of one of the ships, the captain (Mark Lenard) orders his crew to fire torpedoes at it, but they have no effect. The ships take evasive action. Meanwhile, in Federation space, a monitoring station, Epsilon 9, picks up a distress signal from one of the Klingon ships. As the three ships are attempting to escape the cloud, energy beams shoot out and engulf each ship one by one, and they vanish. On Epsilon 9, the crew tracks the course of the cloud and discovers that it is headed for Earth.On Vulcan, Spock (Leonard Nimoy) has been undergoing the kohlinahr ritual, in which he has been learning how to purge all emotions, and is nearly finished with his training. The female Vulcan Master, surrounded by two men, is about to give him an ornate necklace as a symbol of pure logic, when Spock holds out his hand to stop her. Confused, she mind melds with him and senses a consciousness calling to him from space that is affecting his human side. She drops the necklace. ""You have not yet achieved kohlinahr. You must look elsewhere for your answer,"" she says as they leave Spock. ""You will not find it here. Live long and prosper.""In San Francisco, Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) arrives at Starfleet Headquarters in a shuttlecraft. He sees Commander Sonak (Jon Rashad Kamal), a Vulcan science officer who is joining the Enterprise crew and recommended for the position by Kirk himself. Kirk is bothered as to why Sonak is not yet on board. Sonak explains that Captain Willard Decker (Stephen Collins), the new captain of the Enterprise, wanted him to complete his science briefing at Headquarters before they left on their mission. The Enterprise has been undergoing a complete refitting for the past 18 months and is now under final preparations to leave, which would take at least 20 hours, but Kirk informs him that they only have 12. He orders Sonak to report to him on the Enterprise in one hour; he has a short meeting with Admiral Nogura and is intent on being on the ship.Kirk transports to an office complex orbiting Earth and meets Montgomery Scott (James Doohan), the Enterprise's chief engineer. Scotty expresses his concern about the tight departure time. The cloud is less than three days away from Earth, and the Enterprise has been ordered to intercept it because they are the only ship in range. Scotty says that the refit can't be finished in 12 hours, and tries to convince him that the ship needs more work done as well as a shakedown cruise. Kirk insists that they are leaving, ready or not. They board a travel pod and begin the journey over to the drydock in orbit that houses the Enterprise. Scotty informs Kirk that the crew hasn't had enough transition time with all the new equipment and that the engines haven't even been tested at warp power, not to mention that they have an untried captain. Kirk informs Scotty that two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made him a little stale, but that he wouldn't exactly consider himself untried. Kirk then informs a surprised Scotty that Starfleet gave him back his command of the Enterprise. Scotty doubts it, saying that he doesn't think it was that easy with Admiral Nogura, who gave Kirk his orders. They arrive at the Enterprise, and Scotty indulges Kirk with a brief tour of the new exterior of the ship.Upon docking with the ship, Scotty is summoned to Engineering. Kirk goes up to the bridge, and is informed by Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) that Starfleet has just transferred command from Captain Decker over to him. Kirk finds Decker in engineering, whom is visibly upset when Kirk breaks the news that he is assuming command, but recognizes it is necessary because Kirk has more experience. Decker will remain on the ship as second officer. As Decker storms off, an alarm sounds. Someone is trying to beam over to the ship, but the transporter is malfunctioning. Kirk and Scotty race to the transporter room.Transporter operator Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney) is frantically trying to order Starfleet to abort the transport, but it is too late. Commander Sonak and an unknown female officer are beaming in, but their bodies are not reforming properly in the beam. The female officer screams, and then their bodies disappear. Starfleet signals to them that they have died. Kirk orders Starfleet to express his sympathies to their families. In the corridor, Kirk sees Decker and informs him they will have to replace Commander Sonak and wants another Vulcan onboard once possible. Decker informs him that no one is available that is familiar with the ship's new design. Kirk informs Decker he will have to double his duties as science officer as well. In the recreation room, as Kirk briefs the assembled crew on the mission, they receive a transmission from Epsilon 9. Commander Branch (David Gautreaux) informs them they have analyzed the mysterious cloud. It generates an immense amount of energy and measures 2 AUs (300 million km) in diameter. There is also a vessel of some kind in the center. They have attempted to communicate with it and have performed scans, but the cloud reflects them back. It seems to think of the scans as hostile and attacks them. Like the Klingon ships earlier, Epsilon 9 disappears.Later on the bridge, Uhura informs Kirk that the transporter is repaired and now working. Lt. Ilia, (Persis Khambatta), a bald being from the planet Delta IV, arrives. Decker is happy to see her, as they developed a romantic relationship when he was assigned to her planet several years earlier. Ilia is curious about Decker's reduction in rank and Kirk interrupts and informs her about Decker being the executive and science officer. Decker informs her, with slight sarcasm, that Kirk has the utmost confidence in him. Ilia informs Kirk that her oath of celibacy is on record and asks permission to assume her duties. Uhura informs Kirk that one of the last few crew members to arrive is refusing to beam up. Kirk goes to the transporter room to ensure that he beams up. In the transporter room, Kirk orders Starfleet to beam the officer aboard on the double. Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy (DeForest Kelley) materializes on the platform. McCoy is angry that his Starfleet commission was reactivated and that it was Kirk's idea for him to be brought along on the mission. However, his attitude changes when Kirk says he desperately needs him. McCoy leaves to check out the new sickbay.The crew finishes its repairs and the Enterprise leaves drydock and into the solar system. Dr. McCoy comes up to the bridge and complains that the new sickbay is nothing but a computer center. Kirk is anxious to intercept the cloud intruder, and orders Hikaru Sulu (George Takei) to go to warp speed. Suddenly, the ship enters a wormhole, which was created by an engine imbalance, and is about to collide with an asteroid that has been pulled inside. Kirk orders the phasers to be fired on it, but Decker orders Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) to fire photon torpedoes instead. The asteroid is destroyed and the wormhole vanishes. Annoyed, Kirk wants to meet with Decker in his quarters. Dr. McCoy decides to go along.Kirk demands from Decker an explanation on his phaser order countermanded. Decker pointed out that the redesigned Enterprise channeled the phasers through the main engines and because they were imbalanced, the phasers were cut off. Kirk acknowledged that he had saved the ship; however, he accuses Decker of competing with him. Decker informs Kirk that, because of his unfamiliarity with the ship's new design, the mission is in jeopardy. Decker informs Kirk that he will gladly help Kirk understand the new design. Kirk then dismisses him from the room. In the corridor, Decker runs into Ilia. Ilia asked if the confrontation was difficult, and he informs her that it was about as difficult as seeing her again, and apologizes. She asked if he was sorry for leaving Delta IV, or for not saying goodbye. He said that if he had seen her again, would she be able to say goodbye? She says no, and walked around him and entered her quarters nearby.Back in Kirk's quarters, McCoy accuses Kirk of being the one who was competing, and the fact that it was Kirk who used the emergency to pressure Starfleet into letting him get back command of the Enterprise. McCoy thinks that Kirk is obsessed with keeping his command. On Kirk's console viewscreen, Uhura informs Kirk that a long-range shuttle is approaching and that the occupant wishes to dock. Chekov also pipes in and replies that it appears to be a courier vessel. Kirk orders Chekov to handle the situation. The Vulcan shuttle approaches the Enterprise from behind, and the top portion of it detaches and docks at an airlock behind the bridge. Chekov is waiting by the airlock doors and is surprised to see Spock come aboard. Moments later, Spock arrives on the bridge, and everyone is shocked and pleased to see him, yet Spock ignores them. He moves over to the science station and informs Kirk that he is aware of the crisis and knows about the ship's engine design difficulties. He offers to step in as the ship's science officer. McCoy and Dr. Christine Chapel (Majel Barrett) come to the bridge to greet Spock, but Spock just stares alarmingly at their emotional outburst. Spock leaves to discuss fuel equations with Scotty in engineering.With Spock's assistance, the engines are now rebalanced for full warp capacity. The ship successfully goes to warp to intercept the cloud. In the officers lounge, Spock meets with Kirk and McCoy. They discuss Spock's kohlinahr training on Vulcan, and how Spock broke off from his training to join them. Spock describes how he sensed the consciousness of the intruder, from a source more powerful that he has ever encountered, with perfect, logical thought patterns. He believes that it holds the answers he seeks. Uhura informs Kirk over the intercom that they have visual contact with the intruder. The cloud scans the ship, but Kirk orders no return scans and they might be considered hostile. Spock determines that the scans are coming from the center of the cloud. Uhura tries sending linguacode messages, but there is no response. Decker suggests raising the shields for protection, but Kirk determines that might also be considered hostile to the cloud. Spock analyzes the clouds composition, and discovers it has a 12-power energy field, the equivalent of power generated by thousands of starships.Sitting at the science station, Spock awakens from a brief trance. He reveals to Kirk that the alien was communicating with him. The alien is puzzled; it contacted the Enterprise--why has the Enterprise not replied? A red alert sounds, and an energy beam from within the cloud emerged and charges at the Enterprise. Spock analysis the incoming alien weapon as a form of plasma energy, but lists it exact composition and guidance system as unknown. Kirk orders the Enterprise shields raises just as the energy beam (called a 'whiplash bolt') hits the touches the ship's force field, and begins to overload the ship's systems. Bolts of lightning surround the warp core and nearly injure some engineering officers, and Chekov is also hurt--his hand is burned while sitting at the weapons station on the bridge. The energy beam then disappears having expanded its energy. A medical team is summoned to the bridge, and Ilia is able to use her telepathic powers to soothe Chekov's pain. Scotty then contacts the bridge from the engineering room to explain that the ship's shield power is down by over 70% from the plasma energy bolt's impact. Kirk orders some auxiliary powers to be diverted to the shields.Spock then confirms to Kirk that the alien has been attempting to communicate. It communicates at a frequency of more than one million megahertz, and at such a high rate of speed, the message only lasts a millisecond. Spock begins to program the ship's computer to send linguacode messages at that frequency. Another energy beam is sent out, but Spock transmits a message just in time, and the beam disappears. The ship continues on course through the cloud. They pass through many expansive and colorful cloud layers and upon clearing these, a giant vessel is revealed. It is roughly cylindrical in shape, with large spikes jutting out from the surface at equidistant angles between each other, forming a hexagonal shape. Kirk orders Uhura to transmit an image of the alien to Starfleet, but she explains that any transmission sent out of the cloud is being reflected back to them. Kirk orders Sulu to fly above and along the top of the vessel at a distance of 500 meters. The Enterprise is so small compared to the size of the alien vessel that it appears only as a little white dot next to it. The ship travels past many oddly-shaped structures, including a sunken area where the energy beams originate.An alarm sounds, and yet another energy bolt approaches the ship. It appears on the bridge as a column of bright light that emits a very loud noise. The crew struggles to shield their eyes from its brilliant glow. Chekov asks Spock if it is one of the alien's crew, and Spock replies that it is a probe sent from the vessel also made form a plasma energy combination. The probe slowly moves around the room and stops in front of the science station. Bolts of lightning shoot out from it and surround the console--it is trying to access the ship's computer. Spock manages to smash the controls to prevent further access, and the probe gives him an electric shock that sends him rolling onto the floor. The probe approaches the helm/navigation console and it scans Lt. Ilia. Suddenly, she vanishes, along with the probe.Ahead of the ship looms another giant section of the vessel that begins to open up. A tractor beam is drawing the Enterprise toward an opening aperture. Decker calls for Chief DiFalco (Marcy Lafferty) to come up to the bridge as Ilia's replacement. The ship travels deep into the next chamber. Decker wonders why they were brought inside--they could have been easily destroyed outside. Spock deduces that the alien is curious about them. Uhura's monitor shows that the aperture is closing; they are trapped. The ship is released from the tractor beam and suddenly, an intruder alert goes off. Someone has come aboard the ship and is in the crew quarters section.Kirk and Spock arrive inside a crewman's quarters to discover that the intruder is inside the sonic shower. It is revealed to be Ilia, although it isn't really her--there is a small red device attached to her neck. In a mechanized voice, she replies ""You are the Kirk unit--you will listen to me."" She explains that she has been programmed by an entity called ""V'Ger"" to observe and record the normal functions of the carbon-based units (humans) infesting the Enterprise. Kirk opens the shower door and ""Ilia"" steps out, wearing a small white garment that just materialized around her. Dr. McCoy and a security officer enter the room, and Kirk orders McCoy to scan her with a tricorder. Kirk asks her who V'Ger is. She replies ""V'Ger is that which programmed me."" McCoy informs Kirk that Ilia is a mechanism and Spock confirms she is a probe that assumed Ilia's physical form. Kirk asks where the real Ilia is, and the probe states that ""that unit"" no longer functions. Kirk also asks why V'Ger is traveling to Earth, and the probe answers that it wishes to find the Creator, join with him, and become one with it. Spock suggests that McCoy perform a complete examination of the probe.In sickbay, the Ilia probe lays on a diagnostic table, its sensors slowly taking readings. All normal body functions, down to the microscopic level, are exactly duplicated by the probe. Decker arrives and is stunned to see her there. She looks up at him and addresses him as ""Decker"", rather than ""Decker unit"", which intrigues Spock. Spock speaks with Kirk and Decker in an adjoining room, and Spock locks the door. Spock theorizes that the real Ilia's memories and feelings have been duplicated by the probe as well as her body. Decker is angry that the probe killed Ilia, but Kirk convinces him that their only contact with the vessel is through the probe, and they need to use that advantage to find out more about the alien. Suddenly, the probe bursts through the door, and demands that Kirk assist her with her observations. He informs her that Decker will do it with more efficiency.Decker and Ilia are seen walking around in the recreation room. He shows her pictures of the previous ships that were named Enterprise. Decker has been trying to see if Ilia's memories or emotions can resurface, but to no avail. Kirk and McCoy are observing them covertly on a monitor from his quarters. Decker shows her a game that the crew enjoys playing. She is not interested and states that recreation and enjoyment has no meaning to her programming. At another game, which Ilia enjoyed and nearly always won, they both press one of their hands down onto a table to play it. The table lights up, indicating she won the game, and she gazes into Decker's eyes. This moment of emotion ends suddenly, and she returns to normal. She says ""This device serves no purpose.""""Why does the Enterprise require the presence of carbon units?"" she asks. Decker informs her the ship couldn't function without them. She informs him that more information is needed before the crew can be patterned for data storage. Horrified, he asks her what this means. She says ""When my examination is complete, all carbon units will be reduced to data patterns."" He informs her that within her are the memory patterns of a certain carbon unit. He convinces her to let him help her revive those patterns so that she can understand their functions better. She allows him to proceed. Spock slowly enters an airlock room. He sees an officer standing at a console, his back to Spock. Spock quietly approaches him, and gives him the Vulcan nerve pinch to render him unconscious.Decker, the probe, Dr. McCoy and Dr. Chapel are in Ilia's quarters. Dr. Chapel gives the probe a decorative headband that Ilia used to wear. Chapel puts it over ""Ilia's"" head and turns her toward a mirror. Decker asks her if she remembers wearing it on Delta IV. The probe shows another moment of emotion, saying Dr. Chapel's name, and putting her hand on Decker's face, calling him Will. Behind them, McCoy reminds Decker that she is a mechanism. Decker asks ""Ilia"" to help them make contact with V'Ger. She says that she cannot, and Decker asks her who the Creator is. She says V'Ger does not know. The probe becomes emotionless again and removes the headband.Spock is now outside the ship in a space suit with an attached thruster pack. He begins recording a log entry for Kirk detailing his attempt to contact the alien. He activates a panel on the suit and calculates thruster ignition and acceleration to coincide with the opening of an aperture ahead of him. He hopes to get a better view of the spacecraft interior. Kirk comes up to the bridge and Uhura informs him that Starfleet signals are growing stronger, indicating they are very close to Earth. Starfleet is monitoring the intruder and notifies Uhura that it is slowing down in its approach. Sulu confirms this and says that lunar beacons show the intruder is entering into orbit. Chekov informs Kirk that Airlock 4 has been opened and a thruster suit is missing. Kirk figures out that Spock has done it, and orders Chekov to get Spock back on the ship. He changes his mind, and instead orders him to determine his position.Meanwhile, Spock touches a button on his thruster panel and his thruster engine ignites. He is propelled forward rapidly, and enters the next chamber of the vessel just before the aperture closes behind him. The thruster engine shuts down, and the momentum carries Spock ahead further. He disconnects the thruster pack from his suit and it falls away from him. Continuing his log entry, Spock sees an image of what he believes to be V'Ger's home planet. He passes through a tunnel filled with crackling plasma energy, possibly a power source for a gigantic imaging system. He next sees several more images of planets, moons, stars, and galaxies stored and recorded. Spock theorizes that this may be a visual representation of V'Ger's entire journey. ""But who or what are we dealing with?"" he ponders.He sees the Epsilon 9 station, and notes to Kirk that he is convinced that all of what he is seeing is V'Ger; and that they are inside a living machine. Then he sees a giant image of Lt. Ilia with the sensor on her neck. Spock decides it must have some special meaning, so he attempts to mind-meld with it. He is quickly overwhelmed by the multitude of images flooding his mind, and is thrown backward. Kirk is now in a space suit and has exited the ship. The aperture in front of the Enterprise opens, and Spock's unconscious body floats toward him. Later, Dr. Chapel and Dr. McCoy are examining Spock in sickbay. Dr. McCoy performs scans and determines that Spock endured massive neurological trauma from the mind-meld. Spock informs Kirk he should have known and Kirk asks if he was right about V'Ger. Spock calls it a conscious, living entity. Kirk explains that V'Ger considers the Enterprise a living machine and it's why ""Ilia"" refers to the ship as an entity and the crew as an infestation.Spock describes V'Ger's homeworld as a planet populated by living machines with unbelievable technology. But with all that logic and knowledge, V'Ger is barren, with no mystery or meaning. He momentarily lapses into sleep but Kirk rouses him awake to ask what Spock should have known. Spock grasps Kirk's hand and informs him ""This simple feeling is beyond V'Ger's comprehension. No meaning, no hope. And Jim, no answers. It's asking questions. 'Is this all that I am? Is there nothing more?'"" Uhura chimes in and informs Kirk that they are getting a faint signal from Starfleet. The intruder has been on their monitors for a while and the cloud is rapidly dissipating as it approaches. Sulu also comments that the intruder has slowed to sub-warp speed and is three minutes from Earth orbit. Kirk acknowledges and he, McCoy and Spock go up to the bridge.Starfleet sends the Enterprise a tactical report on the intruder's position. Uhura informs Kirk that V'Ger is transmitting a signal. Decker and ""Ilia"" come up to the bridge, and she says that V'Ger is signaling the Creator. Spock determines that the transmission is a radio signal. Decker informs Kirk that V'Ger expects an answer, but Kirk doesn't know the question. Then ""Ilia"" says that the Creator has not responded. An energy bolt is released from V'Ger and positions itself above Earth. Chekov reports that all planetary defense systems have just gone inoperative. Several more bolts are released, and they all split apart to form smaller ones and they assume equidistant positions around the planet. McCoy notices that the bolts are the same ones that hit the ship earlier, and Spock says that these are hundreds of times more powerful, and from those positions, they can destroy all life on Earth. ""Why?"" Kirk asks ""Ilia"". She says that the carbon unit infestation will be removed from the Creator's planet as they are interfering with the Creator's ability to respond and accuses the crew of infesting the Enterprise and interfering in the same manner. Kirk informs ""Ilia"" that carbon units are a natural function of the Creator's planet and they are living things, not infestations. However, ""Ilia"" says they are not true life forms like the Creator. McCoy realizes V'Ger must think its creator is a machine.Spock compares V'Ger to a child, and suggests they treat it like one. McCoy retorts that this child is about to wipe out every living thing on Earth. To get ""Ilia's"" attention, Kirk says that the carbon units know why the Creator has not responded. ""Ilia"" demands that the Creator disclose the information. Kirk won't do it until V'Ger withdraws all the orbiting devices. In response to this, V'Ger interrupts the ship's communications with Starfleet. She orders him again to disclose the information. He refuses, and a plasma energy attack shakes the ship. McCoy informs Spock that the child is having a tantrum. Kirk informs the probe that if V'Ger destroys the Enterprise, then the information it needs will also be destroyed. ""Ilia"" says that it is illogical to withhold the required information, and asks him why he will not disclose it. Kirk explains it is because V'Ger is going to destroy all life forms on Earth. ""Ilia"" says that they have oppressed the Creator, and Kirk makes it clear he will not disclose anything. ""V'Ger needs the information,"" says ""Ilia"". Kirk says that V'Ger will have to withdraw all the orbiting devices. ""Ilia"" says that V'Ger will comply, if the carbon units will give the information.Spock informs Kirk that V'Ger must have a central brain complex. Kirk theorizes that the orbiting devices are controlled from there. Kirk informs ""Ilia"" that the information cannot be disclosed to V'Ger's probe, but only to V'Ger itself. ""Ilia"" stares at the viewscreen, and in response, the aperture opens and drags the ship forward with a tractor beam into the next chamber. Chekov informs Kirk that the energy bolts will reach their final positions and activate in 27 minutes. Kirk calls to Scotty on the intercom and orders him to stand by to execute Starfleet Order 2005; the self-destruct command. A female crew member asks Scotty why Kirk ordered self-destruct, and Scotty informs her that Kirk hopes that when they explode, so will the intruder.The countdown is now down to 18 minutes. DiFalco reports that they have traveled 17 kilometers inside the vessel. Kirk goes over to Spock's station, and sees that Spock has been crying. ""Not for us,"" Kirk realizes. Spock informs him he is crying for V'Ger, and that he weeps for V'Ger as he would for a brother. As he was when he came aboard the Enterprise, so is V'Ger now--empty, incomplete and searching. Logic and knowledge are not enough. McCoy realizes Spock has found what he needed, but that V'Ger hasn't. Decker wonders what V'Ger would need to fulfill itself. Spock comments that each one of us, at some point in our lives asks, ""Why am I here?"" ""What was I meant to be?"" V'Ger hopes to touch its Creator and find those answers. DiFalco directs Kirk's attention to the viewscreen. Ahead of them is a structure with a bright light. Sulu reports that forward motion has stopped. Chekov replies that an oxygen/gravity envelope has formed outside of the ship. ""Ilia"" points to the structure on the screen and identifies it as V'Ger. Uhura has located the source of the radio signal and it is straight ahead. A passageway forms outside the ship as Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Decker and ""Ilia"" enter a turbolift.The landing party exits an airlock on the top of the saucer section and walks up the passageway. At the end of the path is a concave structure, and in the center of it is an ancient NASA probe from three centuries earlier. Kirk tries to rub away the soot on the nameplate and makes out the letters V-GER. He continues to rub away more of the residue, and discovers that the craft is actually Voyager 6. Kirk recalls the history of the Voyager program--it was designed to collect data and transmit it back to Earth. Decker informs Kirk that Voyager 6 disappeared through a black hole over 300 years earlier after it was launched. Kirk says that it must have emerged on the far side of the galaxy and got caught in the machine planet's gravity. Spock theorizes that the planet's inhabitants found the probe to be one of their own kind--primitive, yet kindred. They discovered the probe's 20th century programming, which was to collect data and return that information to its creator. The machines interpreted that instruction literally, and constructed the entire vessel so that Voyager could fulfill its programming. Kirk continues by saying that on its journey back, it amassed so much knowledge that it gained its own consciousness.""Ilia"" informs Kirk that V'Ger awaits the information. Kirk calls Uhura on his communicator and orders her to find information on the Voyager XI probe in the ship's computer library records, specifically the NASA code signal, which will allow the probe to transmit its data. Decker realizes that that is what the probe was signaling--its readiness to transmit everything. Kirk then says that there is no one on Earth who recognizes the old-style signal--the Creator does not answer. Kirk calls out to V'Ger and says that they are the Creator. ""Ilia"" says that is not logical--carbon units are not true life forms. Kirk says they will prove it by allowing V'Ger to complete its programming. Uhura calls Kirk on his communicator and informs him she has retrieved the code. Kirk orders her to set the Enterprise transmitter to the code frequency and to transmit the signal. Decker reads off the numerical code on his tricorder, and is about to read the final sequence, but Voyager's circuitry burns out, an effort by V'Ger itself to prevent the last part of the code from being transmitted.""Ilia"" says that the Creator must join with V'Ger, and turns toward Decker. McCoy warns Kirk that they only have 10 minutes left. Decker figures out that V'Ger wanted to bring the Creator here and transmit the code signal in person. Spock informs Kirk that V'Ger's knowledge has reached the limits of the universe and it must evolve. Kirk says that V'Ger needs a human quality in order to evolve. Decker thinks that V'Ger joining with the Creator will accomplish that. He then goes over to the damaged circuitry and fixes the wires so he can manually enter the rest of the code through the ground test computer. Kirk tries to stop him, but ""Ilia"" tosses him aside. Decker informs Kirk that he wants this as much as Kirk wanted the Enterprise. Suddenly, a bright light forms around Decker's body. ""Ilia"" moves over to him, and the light encompasses them both as they merge together. Their bodies disappear, and the light expands and begins to consume the area. Kirk, Spock and McCoy retreat back to the Enterprise. V'Ger explodes and disappears in a flash of light, leaving the Enterprise above Earth, unharmed. On the bridge, Kirk wonders if they just saw the beginning of a new life form, and Spock says yes and that it is possibly the next step in their evolution. McCoy says that its been a while since he delivered a baby, and hopes that they got this one off to a good start.Uhura informs Kirk that Starfleet is requesting the ship's damage and injury reports and complete vessel status. Kirk reports that there were only two casualties: Lt. Ilia and Captain Decker. He quickly corrects his statement and changes their status to missing. Vessel status: fully operational. Scotty comes on the bridge and agrees with Kirk that it's time to give the Enterprise a proper shakedown. When Scotty offers to have Spock back on Vulcan in four days, Spock says that's unnecessary, as his task on Vulcan is completed. Kirk orders Sulu to proceed ahead at warp factor one. When DiFalco asks for a heading, Kirk simply says ""Out there, thataway."" With that, the Enterprise flies overhead and engages warp drive."
tt0080013,['Drama'],"I fully planned to follow the synopsis editing policy, but if you've read the existing plot summary, then you already know pretty much the entire story. The summary has covered everything worth knowing including how the story ends. How such a summary got by imdb review is quite a mystery since no one I know can quite get away with pulling that off. I am now going to add some lines to fill out the synopsis to the required ten lines demanded by imdb, because as I've already mentioned, the plot summary has indeed told us everything and there's nothing of significant importance to add.
I counted the lines that I wrote which totaled eleven on the page I was given to write a detailed synopsis, but a preview of the page triggered an error message indicating I hadn't yet written 10 lines???
So, once again, since the plot summary covered the entire story board, including the ending and even spoilers, anyone can see there's not much left to include in a synopsis, and filling in even ten lines seems rather ludicrous...
Not leaving me anything of significance to write a synopsis with is hardly my fault and would not constitute a justifiable reason for losing the privilege of writing or editing a future synopsis."
tt0080025,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'SciFi', 'Thriller']","In 1893 London, England, popular writer Herbert George ""H.G."" Wells (Malcolm McDowell) displays a time machine to his skeptical dinner guests. After explaining how it works (including a ""non-return key"" that keeps the machine at the traveler's destination and a ""vaporizing equalizer"" that keeps the traveler and machine on equal terms), police constables arrive at the house searching for the serial killer Jack the Ripper. One finds a bag, with blood-stained gloves, belonging to one of Herbert's friends, a surgeon named John Leslie Stevenson (David Warner), whom they are unable to locate in the house, concluding that Stevenson might be the infamous killer. Wells races to his laboratory, but the time machine is gone.Stevenson has escaped to the future, but because he does not have the ""non-return"" key, it automatically returns to 1893. Herbert uses it to pursue Stevenson to November 5, 1979, where the machine has ended up on display at a museum in San Francisco realizing that due to the machine traveling backwards by the geographic longitide and latitude, the machine had ended up in the unfamiliar USA. As Herbert walks around the city, he is deeply shocked by the future, having expected it to be an enlightened socialist utopia, only to find chaos in the form of airplanes, automobiles and a worldwide history of war, crime and bloodshed.Searching numerous banks for Stevenson - he believes an Englishman might need to exchange old currency - Herbert meets liberated Chartered Bank of London employee Amy Robbins (Mary Steenburgen). She directs Herbert to the Hyatt Regency hotel, as she previously had Stevenson.Confronted in his room by his onetime friend Herbert, Stevenson confesses that he finds modern society to be pleasingly violent. Apologetically, he states: ""Ninety years ago, I was a freak. Now... I'm an amateur."" Herbert demands he return with him to 1893 to face justice, but Stevenson, who without the ""return key"" would be unable to prevent the machine from automatically returning (and thereby blocking Herbert from any further pursuit), attempts to wrest it from him. Their struggle is interrupted by a hotel employees and Stevenson flees, getting hit by a car during the frantic chase on foot. Herbert follows him to the San Francisco General Hospital emergency room and mistakenly gets the impression that Stevenson had died from his injuries.Herbert meets up with Amy Robbins again and she is the aggressor in a romance (succeeding, once Herbert is sure that she is in earnest). Stevenson returns to the bank to exchange more money. Rightly concluding that it was Amy who had led Herbert to him, he finds out where she lives. Herbert, hoping to convince her of the truth, takes a highly skeptical Amy three days into the future. Once there, she is aghast to see a newspaper headline revealing her own murder as the Ripper's fifth victim (a temporal paradox).Herbert persuades her that they must go back - it is their duty to attempt to prevent the fourth victim's murder, then prevent Amy's. However, they are delayed upon their return to the present and can do no more than phone the police. Stevenson kills again, and Herbert is arrested because of his knowledge of the killing. Amy is left alone, totally defenseless, and at the mercy of the ""San Francisco Ripper.""At the police station, Herbert unsuccessfully tries to convince the police of Amy's peril (his claim to be ""Sherlock Holmes"" has marked him as a lunatic well before mentioning a ""time machine""). At the same time, Amy attempts to hide from Stevenson. When the police finally do investigate her apartment, they find the dismembered body of a woman. Since he was in custody at the time Herbert is released having been cleared as a suspect. As Herbert wonders the dark streets mourning Amy's brutal death, he is suddenly confronted by Stevenson, who has actually killed Amy's co-worker Carol, who had accepted an invitation for dinner and to meet Wells. Stevenson then kidnapped Amy in order to extort the time machine key from Wells.Stevenson flees with the key - and Amy as insurance - to attempt a permanent escape in the time machine. Herbert gives chase in a car (despite not driving very well while Stevenson forces Amy to drive her car at gunpoint). Breaking into the museum, Herbert bargains for Amy's life, she is able to escape. As Stevenson starts up the time machine with the key, Herbert removes the ""vaporizing equalizer"" from the machine and Stevenson nods in understanding. The removal of this component, Herbert had confirmed earlier, causes the machine to remain in place while its passenger is sent traveling endlessly through time, with no way to stop; in effect sending him to oblivion.Herbert proclaims that the time has come to return to his own time, by himself, in order to destroy a machine that is too dangerous for primitive mankind. Amy pleads with him to take her along (despite her aversion to living in Victorian England). As they depart back to the past, she says that she is changing her name to Susan B. Anthony. The end credits reveal that the two later married."

When their car gets a flat tire, Woody goes to find a gas station. Their friends Becky (Tanya Roberts), Jerry (Jon Van Ness) and Molly (Jocelyn Jones) are traveling separately in a different vehicle. They reach Eileen waiting at the car and they all drive off to collect Woody.Woody has found a gas station but it appears deserted. He enters the back room but becomes trapped when the door closes by itself behind him. Various mannequins appear in the room, and multiple objects fly at him until a metal pipe impales and kills him.A little later, Eileen, Becky, Molly and Jerry happen upon a run-down ghost town called 'Slausen's Lost Oasis' (the tourist trap in the title) and conclude Woody is there. As they drive in, their vehicle mysteriously breaks down. Jerry tries to fix his jeep and the girls go skinny dipping in a nearby oasis. As the three women swim, a strange-looking middle-aged man, who introduces himself as Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors) appears holding a shotgun. Though outwardly polite, he also seems embittered by the decline of his tourist trap since the local expressway was moved away. The three nude girls feel awkward in the water as he casually chats with them, and they apologize for trespassing on his property.Slausen offers to help Jerry with the jeep, but insists the group go to his house with him to get his tools. There, they see the tourist trap: animated wax works type figures including armed bandits. Eileen is curious about a nearby house, but Slausen insists the women stay inside the museum. Slausen takes Jerry to fix the jeep leaving the women. Eileen leaves to find a phone in the other house. There she finds several mannequins inside the house. Someone calls her name, and a stranger wearing a grotesque mask suddenly appears behind her. Various items in the room move of their own accord and the scarf Eileen is wearing tightens and strangles her to death.Slausen returns to Molly and Becky saying that Jerry drove his truck into town. When told that Eileen left, he goes to the house and finds Eileen has been turned into a mannequin. He returns and tells Molly and Becky he did not find Eileen and will leave again to continue the search. Frustrated, the women also later leave to search for her. Becky enters the nearby house and finds a mannequin resembling Eileen. Becky is attacked by the masked killer and then by multiple mannequins. She later wakes up tied up in the basement along with Jerry. Jerry says the killer is Slausen's brother. Also held captive is a young woman named Tina (Dawn Jeffory), who is strapped to a table. She is killed when the masked man covers her face with plaster, causing her to suffocate. Jerry frees himself and attacks the killer, but is soon overpowered. Tied back up, Jerry tries to reach for a key but the killer telepathically moves it from his reach... revealing that the killer has the power of telekinesis.Molly, still outside searching for the others, is pursued by the masked man. She meets Slausen who drives her to the museum and gives her a gun while he goes inside. The masked man appears and Molly shoots, but the gun is loaded with blanks. The man removes the mask: it is Slausen. She panics and tries to elude Slausen but is soon captured and restrained to a bed.Meanwhile, Becky and Jerry escape from the basement but, get separated. Slausen appears and takes Becky to the museum. There the Old West figures begin shooting at her, and she is killed by a Indian Chief figure who throws a knife at her, stabbing her in the back of the neck.Back at the house, Molly manages to untie herself and attempts to look for a way out. She is forced to hide when Slausen appears again and, using his telekinesis, makes many of the mannequins move by themselves. He finds Molly hiding and invites him to dance with him. Jerry arrives to rescue Molly, but he is revealed to have unknowingly been turned into a mannequin as Slausen reveals it by ""removing"" his arm. Slausen dances with the mannequin figure of his wife, and Molly sees that the wife has become animated as a real person. Traumatized by all of this, Molly finds a hatchet where she sneaks up behind Slausen, and slams the axe into his shoulder as he turns around. With Slausen finally dead and his power gone, all of the mannequins in the room stop moving.The film then ends where it takes place the next morning, and a grinning and clearly insane Molly is seen driving away in the jeep with the mannequin versions of her friends."

Tell the crew.""Several days later, an apparently abandoned sailboat sails into New York harbor. Two officers of the harbor patrol board the boat to investigate and find the living quarters in squalor and disarray. They are suddenly attacked by a rotting, bloated zombie (Captain Haggerty) which bursts from the hold, gorily killing one officer by biting his throat out, before being shot and propelled overboard by the second officer.A local reporter named Peter West (Ian McCulloch) is assigned by his hard-nosed editor (director Lucio Fulci) to the case. That evening he meets up with  (Tisa Farrow) the daughter of the boat's missing owner. Anne has informed the police that she has not seen her father for the past three months since he traveled to the Antilles. Meanwhile at the morgue, the pathologist and his assistant are preparing to perform an autopsy on the dead police officer, when unknown to them, the dead body begins stirring...The next morning, Peter and Anne fly to the Dominican Republic and meet an American tourist couple named Brian Hull (Al Cliver) and Susan Barrett (Auretta Gay) who are about to embark on a sailing tour of the Caribbean. Peter and Anne ask them to help them get to the island of Matul, where Anne's father was last heard from. Despite Brian's claim about warnings from the superstitious locals about Matul, the four of them agree to set off together for the island.On Matul, tensions between  (Richard Johnson) and his contemptuous, highly strung-out wife Paola (Olga Karlatos) are running high. She wants to leave island, terrified about reports of zombie attacks. He insists on staying to conduct research into the phenomenon, despite the fact that his medical mission is falling apart. Leaving her alone to drink her fears away at their isolated beach house, Menard drives in his jeep to his hospital, which is a ramshackle converted church buzzing with flies. Menard's superstitious Haitian assistant Lucas (Dakar) insists that they leave, for all of the villagers of the nearby town are fleeing in fear of the rising of the dead. Menard scoffs at all this.At sea, Susan goes on a scuba dive where she gets attacked, first by a shark, then by a strange aquatic zombie. Susan gets away, leaving the zombie to fight against the shark.That evening, Paola Menard is alone in the house where she takes a shower to cool off in the hot and humid weather, when she hears a noise. Investigating, she is attacked by a marauding cadaver (unseen except for a rotting, outstretched hand). As she struggles to barricade herself into her bedroom, the zombie smashes its arm through the door and grabs her by her hair. Her head is slowly pulled onto the shattered doorframe, and she dies a horrible death as her right eye is impaled on a spike of slatted wood as she's pulled out the door.The next morning, Anne, Peter, Brian, and Susan arrive off the coast of Matul where they find out that their boat has been damaged by the shark attack. They anchor in a bay off the island and send up distress flares. Menard answers their distress call as Luca and Menard's personal nurse (Stefania D'Amario) bury more dead bodies, victims of a mysterious virus that's killing the islands residents and resurrecting them as zombies. The survivors are forced to shoot each corpse in the head to prevent them from reviving before burying them. On the drive back to the hospital, Menard tells his four visitors that Anne's father (Ugo Bologna) died three months earlier from the strange disease plaguing the island. Menard also tells the disbelieving visitors that the zombie epidemic, so far on the other side of the island, is blamed by the locals on the voodoo curses of a evil witch doctor. When they arrive at the hospital, Menard's nurse informs him that a friend has been taken ill. Menard then asks Peter, Anne, Brian, and Susan to drive over his house and check on the safety of his wife. Menard looks at his friend, Fritz, who claims he was bitten by a zombie in the village. Menard orders Lucas to lock all the doors and windows, now aware that the zombies are approaching this end of the island.Meanwhile, Peter, Anne, Brian, and Susan arrive without incident at the Menard cottage and upon entering they make a horrific discovery. The dead body of Mrs. Menard is sprawled out outside the bedroom door, half-eaten, surrounded by a small group of zombies who are gorging on her remains. Revolted, they fight their way past a group of slow-moving, staggering zombies and drive back to the hospital. But on the road, a zombie wonders into their path, and the jeep is damaged as they swerve into the dense tropical undergrowth. Peter's left ankle is broken upon the impact, but the group decide they must make it back to the hospital.A little later, the group stops for a rest in a small jungle clearing which they see is an old cemetery for the Spanish Conquistadors. As Peter and Anne lie down on the ground for a rest, the buried Conquistadors emerge from the soil. One of them grabs Anne by her hair while another grabs Peter by his broken ankle. The two of them break free, but Susan is not so lucky. Frozen in terror by the sight of a large, worm-faced cadaver (Ottaviano Dell'Acqua), she dies as it bites her throat out before it's dispatched by Peter and Brian, who bash the creature's head in. The three survivors are now obliged to make the journey back to the hospital as the living dead erupt from their tombs all over the island, as well as stalk the deserted shanty village nearby.At nightfall, Anne, Peter, and Brian finally arrive back at the hospital. Dr. Menard tends to Peter's broken ankle, while Brian helps Lucas and the nurse barricade the doors and windows. Menard is informed to his wife's fate, but does not comment on it. Instead, he raves about his failed efforts to find a scientific explanation for the walking dead and their instinct to feed on human flesh. Suddenly, a large group of the tottering, implacable creatures try to batter down the boarded up front door. Menard and the group begin to construct barricades as well as make Molotov cocktails from the kerosene tanks. However, the hospital's sick patients are dying and coming back as zombies, making the hospital under attack from inside and out. Menard is the first to go when he gets his face ripped off by the zombie Fritz, before it's killed by Brian with a gunshot to the head, the only way of killing the reanimated zombies. Lucas is next when he gets part of his arm bitten off by another zombie. The nurse is then killed by the zombie Lucas, who then attacks Anne but gets shot dead by Peter. The mob of zombies finally breaks down the front door, and a climactic battle between the three survivors and the foul creatures begins, with fire apparently the only effective weapon against the slow moving, walking stiffs. With the hospital now on fire from the exploding Molotov cocktails, Anne, Peter, and Brian are forced to flee from the burning building out the back door. But outside, Brian comes face to face with the walking corpse of the resurrected Susan. He succumbs to emotion and gets badly bitten on his arm as a result. The zombie Susan is immediately shot and killed by Peter, and the trio run for the beach with some zombies not far behind.As dawn breaks, the gerry-rigged boat limps back out to sea. Brian sinks into unconsciousness, terminally sick from the zombie bite, and soon dies. Peter and Anne lock the dead Brian up in the boat's cabin, for Peter wants the dead Brian as proof to the authorities that the whole experience happened. Turning on the radio, Peter and Anne listen in disbelief as a radio announcer explains about a zombie epidemic gripping New York City apparently brought on the by zombie from the opening scene. Down in the cabin, Brian's re-animated corpse frantically tries to get out of the hold it is locked up in.In New York City, a long line of freshly dead zombies are seen, slowly marching across the Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan."

They have sex for the first time.Over the opening credits, we are introduced to ""Baldies"" a 40-strong gang of the most fearsome-looking hooligans, distinguished by their shaved heads and black leather jackets, gathering on a street corner under the command of their and their burly leader, known only as ""Terror"" (Erland Van Lidth) Nearby, Joey (John Friedrich), a feisty member the Wanderers, tries to persuade his friend Turkey (Alan Rosenburg) (who has just shaved his own head) not to join the Baldies. When Joey, being small but foolishly brave, insults the group's appearance, he is heard by Pee Wee (Linda Manz), a teenage tomboy and the sole member of the Baldies Ladies Auxuilary. The Baldies, including Terror and Pee Wee, chase Joey and Turkey who must literally run for their lives. As Joey runs through the streets, he signals the Wanderers for help. Richie along with another Wanderer member, named Buddy (Jim Youngs), appear, but when they see the Baldies, they join Joey and Turkey in flight.Cornered by the Baldies in a back alleyway, the four Wanderers prepare to fight. Suddenly, a tough, confident stranger named Perry (Tony Ganios) appears and intimidates the Baldies. Perry all by himself beats up several of the brawler Baldies forcing them to retreat. Terror then appears and confronts Perry. But after tense silence, to the other Wanderers' surprise, Terror suddenly backs down from fighting Perry and orders his henchmen to withdraw. Perry then leaves before the Wanderers have a chance to thank him.Later that evening, Joey meets Perry once again and learns that he lives right in his apartment building. Perry, a fellow Italian, has recently transferred to the all-boys high school that the Wanderers attend from New Jersey. Joey invites Perry to join the Wanderers and informs him that being a member of a gang is necessary for protection. Both Joey and Perry have trouble at home; Joey is afraid of his abusive and macho father Emilio (William Andrews), while Perry's widowed mother (never seen on-camera) is an alcoholic.In class, Perry watches as an argument escalates between African American and Italian students when their teacher Mr. Sharp (Val Avery) tries to teach them ""brotherhood"" in co-existing with each other. The argument turns violent as Richie, the leader of the Wanderers, agrees to meet gang leader Clinton (Michael Wright) and his African American followers, the ""Del Bombers,"" for a fight on Saturday, but without guns or knives. In the meantime, Richie tries to build an alliance with the violent Irish gang, known as the ""Ducky Boys,"" and the ""Wongs,"" who are the Chinese, but both groups are distrustful of his offer. Although ""Turkey"" was a member of the Wanderers in high school, he admires the Baldies, and, still hoping to join them, he encourages Richie to reach out to the group, but Richie rejects the idea. Later, the Baldies harass Richie and Joey, while Turkey is forced to betray his friends and participate in the bullying.After the incident, Richie accepts an offer of assistance from the local Italian mafia boss owner Chubby Galasso (Dolph Sweet), who is the father of Despie. At his bowling alley, Chubby bashes a group of hustlers in front of Richie to demonstrate his authority, which leaves a chilling impression on the teenager. Instead of fighting the Del Bombers, Chubby tells Richie to settle the matter in a football game, and Chubby and his friends will bet money on the Wanderers, who are undefeated this season. To negotiate the arrangement, Chubby welcomes representatives from the Del Bombers to the bowling alley.Sometime later, Richie, Joey, Perry, and Buddy flirt with women on the sidewalk by bumping into them so they can grab at their breasts. Here, Richie meets Nina (Karen Allen), a young non-Italian teenager who is immediately attracted to Richie. Since Richie has a girl friend, Joey shouts out his telephone number to Nina. The friends follow Nina's car, but they take a wrong turn and arrive in an area controlled by the Ducky Boys. A fight ensues, and Perry's arm is broken by a baseball bat. After returning home that evening, Joey and Perry see Joey's father leaving Perry's mother's apartment... implying that they have been sleeping with each other. However, Joey is thrilled when Nina telephones and wants to join him and the Wanderers for a party, hosted by Despie at her parents' house.At the party that Saturday night, although Richie is captivated by Nina, he encourages best friend Joey to seduce her. In a separate room from the party guests, Richie and Joey play strip poker with Nina and Despie, which the guys cheat at. During the game, Despie notices Richie's interest in Nina and storms away. As soon as they are alone together, Richie and Nina kiss, then they leave to have sex in her car.Meanwhile, the Baldies are at their street corner hangout when in a drunken state, they are observed by a US Marine recruitment sergeant (Burrt Harris) working at an Armed Forces recruitment office. He invites the Baldies into his office and tricks them into joining the Marines, much to Pee Wee's dismay. Now intoxicated and looking to incite a ruckus, the Baldies arrive at the Galasso house and instruct Turkey to go inside and bring back women. As Turkey surprises the party-goers, he is assaulted by Perry. The Baldies, meanwhile, abandon their new recruit and drive away. Outside, Joey is shocked to see Richie seducing Nina in the car. When Richie tries to explain, Joey punches him and walks away, while Despie is tearful and curses her boyfriend.Elsewhere, Turkey runs through the streets to find the Baldies, but he becomes lost and encounters the Ducky Boys who are attending mass at a local church. Turkey then foolishly propositions one of the Ducky Boy leaders who investigates Turkey's shouting. The Ducky Boys then chase Turkey and terrorize him. After climbing up an elevated subway structure, Turkey looses his balance and plunges to his death. Later, at school, Joey mourns Turkey, telling classmates that he will be missed.Meanwhile, the Wanderers continue to ignore Richie for his betrayal of Joey. A few days later, on November 22, 1963, Richie and Despie encounter each other at a storefront, where the news of President Kennedy's assassination unfolds on television, they comfort one another and reconcile. Despie reveals she is pregnant as a result of their one-time sexual encounter. Chubby then confronts the young man and declares that he must take responsibility and marry his daughter and move into their house. Without waiting for a reply, Chubby congratulates Richie and calls him son-in-law.Elsewhere, Joey tries to cope with his abusive father, Emilio, while making a banner for the football game. On the day of the event at Van Courtland Park, the Del Bombers arrive at the stadium with confidence, accompanied by cheerleaders and music. Meanwhile, Richie hides on the sidelines while the Wanderers start the game, and Joey replaces him as quarterback. As the Del Bombers take a commanding lead, Joey becomes frustrated. Richie then arrives on the field, apologizes to his friend and guides the team toward tying the score. Suddenly, a large number of Ducky Boys appear at the stadium, wielding sticks and knives. As spectators flee, the Wanderers and the Del Bombers brace for a fight. Displaying their martial arts skills, the Wongs also enter the melee and assault the Ducky Boys. Joey's brutish father also joins the action. Despite the injuries, the combined alliance of gangs impedes the attack, and the Ducky Boys scramble from the field. In his rage to fight, however, Emilio strikes his son, knocking him to the ground.Afterward, Joey stays with Perry and declares he is never returning home, while Perry shares that his mother is an alcoholic. The two friends plan to drive out of town that night and leave for California to begin a new life. Emilio then arrives at the apartment. When he intimidates his son, Perry defends Joey, and a fight ensues. Joey hits his father on the head with a glass bottle, and the boys flee.Later, the Wanderers, the Del Bombers, and the Wongs surprise Richie with a bachelor party at the restaurant where he works as a dishwasher. Even Pee Wee attends the party, revealing that Terror and all of the Baldies are gone, having left days earlier for Marine boot camp.

tt0080120,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Thriller']","As night falls over Coney Island, Cleon (Dorsey Wright), leader of the Warriors, meets up with eight of his most trusted lieutenants to travel by subway to the faraway Bronx. They will be attending an event called by a man named Cyrus, described as ""the one and only."" Throughout the city, other gang delegations are seen entering the subway in their full colors. As the Warriors speculate about the event during their subway ride, we learn that Cyrus, called ""The One and Only"", leader of the largest gang in the city, the Gramercy Riffs, has called a truce of all the gangs in New York. He wants an unarmed delegation of nine from each gang to come to a mass meeting to hear what he has to say. Some of the Warriors are excited at the prospect, while others are skeptical.At Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, the meeting is well-attended with over 100 gangs represented. The charismatic Cyrus (Roger Hill) takes the stage and delivers a spellbinding speech. He says that, instead of fighting each other over turf, they could unite to form an army of 60,000 soldiers, compared to only 20,000 police in the whole city. He punctuates his points with ""Can you dig it?"" to the crowd's wild response. Outside the meeting area, the police are seen silently moving in.Most of the crowd is enthralled with Cyrus' vision, but one member has his own agenda. Luther (David Patrick Kelley), the psychotic leader of a gang called the Rogues, has snuck a gun into the gathering. At a high point in the speech, Luther fires at Cyrus, killing him instantly. When Cyrus falls back, there is a brief stunned silence, followed by pandemonium. The crowd was so fixated on Cyrus that hardly anyone saw who fired the shot, but Luther turns to see that Fox (Thomas G. Waites) of the Warriors witnessed the assassination, so he points the gun to kill Fox. Just at that moment the police spotlights come on, blinding Luther.Cleon walks towards the middle of the chaos, to see whether Cyrus survived. Luther begins screaming to the crowd, ""That's him! The guy who shot Cyrus!"" Another member of the Rogues also claims to have seen Cleon shoot Cyrus. Cleon denies it, but Luther continues to scream ""The Warriors did it! The Warriors did it!"" and charges at Cleon. Cleon holds his own in a fight against the Rogues, but then the Gramercy Riffs, martial arts experts, step in and bring Cleon down with kicks and elbow hits. Cleon presumably has been killed.The other Warriors break through a wooden fence to make their escape, winding up in a cemetery as the rest of the police rush into the park and the various gangs flee. They take a head count and determine that everyone is there except for Cleon. Swan (Michael Beck), who as war chief is the second-ranked member after Cleon, states they are going to the subway, to catch a train back to Coney Island. A member named Ajax (James Remar) gives Swan some trouble when he asks: ""Who made you leader?"" Swan advises him to make his move, but the remaining members intervene, telling Ajax to calm down and urging everyone to stick together. Ajax backs down for now, and they make their way toward the subway, worrying whether the truce is still on. If it isn't, they will have to ""bop"" (fight their way) across other gangs' territories, vulnerable because they are wearing their colors and are not ""packed"" (armed).Meanwhile, the Gramercy Riffs' new leader, Masai (Edward Sewer), addresses the Riffs at their underground hideout. He wants the Warriors, alive if possible. The Riffs inform a local DJ (Lynne Thigpen), and she puts the word out on the radio, urging all local gangs to be on the lookout and capture or kill the Warriors, ""the gang that broke the truce"", for the Riffs. She dedicates the song ""Nowhere to Run"" to the Warriors. As the song plays, gangs throughout the city are getting ready to hunt down Cyrus' assassins.The Warriors wait for a train outside an elevated train station, so that they will not be ambushed on a open platform. Ajax complains that they are acting like ""wimps,"" but the others' caution is justified, since a school bus filled with a tough-looking skinhead gang known as the Turnbull ACs begins patrolling the area. When the train arrives, the Warriors make a break for it and barely make the train ahead of the gang. Masai is informed of the Turnbulls' failure. Meanwhile, Luther gets a telephone update from an informant and learns that the Riffs have put the word out on the street that they want the Warriors alive. The Rogues don't want the Warriors taken alive, for fear of the stories they might tell. Luther tells his crew that they can do some looking too.The celebrating Warriors' journey home is cut short when a fire on the tracks delays the train. They have no choice but to make their way to the next station on foot. That route takes them directly through the Bronx territory of a small, low-level gang known as the Orphans, who did not attend the gathering at Van Cortlandt Park and apparently don't know of the contract out on the Warriors. After determining the Orphans' numbers to be at least 30 versus their eight, Swan decides a diplomatic solution would be best. He brings Fox with him to meet with the Orphans' leader (Paul Greco). After a bit of tough posturing, the leader accepts the explanation of the subway fire, buttered up a bit by Fox's respectful comments, and tells them they can move through the territory if they come in peace. However, his girlfriend Mercy (Deborah Van Valkenburgh) begins taunting him with chicken noises and cutting comments. The leader's manhood is now insulted, so he orders the Warriors to remove their gang colors if they want to proceed through their territory. Swan refuses in no uncertain terms, and the Orphans leave while the Warriors march on.The curious Mercy tails the Warriors, and gets caught by Ajax. She claims to want some real action. Just then, the Orphans show up again, packed and ready to rumble. They throw some tough words around, but Snow (Brian Tyler) produces a Molotov cocktail, which Swan throws at a car near the Orphans. The Warriors take off past the flaming vehicle. The car explodes, the Orphans fail to pursue, and the Warriors hightail it to the next station with Mercy. She seems determined to stick around for the ride.The DJ passes on the news of the Orphans' defeat. Luther gets another update that the Warriors are making their way through and that the cops are out to get every gang in the city. When asked why he seems so happy about this situation, Luther responds ""I'm having a good time!""The train at the 96th street station is not moving and the frustration of the Warriors, especially Vermin (Terry Michos), is obvious. A police officer walks by the car, and they take off running. During this escape they split into three separate groups. Fox and Mercy run down the platform. A cop comes from behind one of the pillars, and tackles Fox. Fox yells at Mercy to run away, and in the struggle the cop tosses Fox onto the tracks, where he is killed by an oncoming train. Mercy is running in the other direction and doesn't see Fox's death.Vermin, Cochise (David Harris), and Rembrandt (Marcelino Sanchez) manage to evade the police and board a subway train to Union Square, the agreed upon meeting place if they are split up. Ajax, Swan, Snow, and Cowboy (Tom Mckitterick) also outrun the police and exit the station at the front door, only to find a bigger potential threat - a group of men in baseball uniforms, their faces painted, leisurely swinging baseball bats. The Baseball Furies have been waiting for them. The four Warriors take off running down the street. The chase continues into Riverside Park. Swan and Snow split to the side, leaving Ajax and Cowboy running forward. The Furies fail to see the split, and follow Ajax and Cowboy. Swan and Snow circle to the Furies' backs. Cowboy can no longer run, so Ajax turns to face his foes, with Swan coming up from the rear. In the ensuing melee, Ajax's and Swan's fighting skills shine. They succeed in wresting control of bats and eventually in laying out all of the Furies.The DJ announces the Baseball Furies' defeat and disparages all the gangs for their poor performance.Meanwhile, Vermin, Cochise and Rembrandt have arrived at Union Square to wait for the others. They see a group of six young women giving them ""come hither"" looks. Cochise and Vermin can't believe their luck in finding attractive chicks who seem to want to party with them, naively failing to realize that the women are lesbians. Only Rembrandt, the youngest Warrior, senses the danger. They go to the group's clubhouse and the leader (Lisa Mauer) identifies them as the Lizzies, an all-girl gang and says that they want to get down with the Warriors because they've heard of their reputation. Cochise and Vermin waste no time heading off to couches with their choice of girl. Rembrandt stays aloof and says that they need to get back. He notices the women exchanging glances, but before he can react, the door is locked and the leader pulls a gun and says ""So you guys are the famous Warriors? The guys who shot Cyrus."" Rembrandt shouts a warning and the three crash through a door, dodging bullets to escape. Rembrandt informs the others of what he has learned; that the women thought the Warriors shot Cyrus. They finally realize that every gang in the city must be looking for them.Swan and his crew continue walking through the park. They pass a lady on a bench (Mercedes Ruehl), who gives her best smile. Ajax decides to play games with the woman, and won't be dissuaded even after the others press on him the need to get home. Ajax disparages the others' manhood and turns back toward the woman. A few minutes later, Cowboy and Snow decide to go back to look after Ajax, and Swan continues to the station alone. The woman turns out to be an undercover cop, and Ajax is arrested when he tries to assault her, getting himself handcuffed to the bench they were sitting on. There's nothing Cowboy and Snow can do, so they make their way to Union Square.When Swan gets back to the 96th street station, he finds Mercy still hanging around. A cop spots them, and the two wind up running into a tunnel. Holed up in an underpass off the tracks, Mercy comes on to Swan. He insults her and says he wants to find something better. Mercy declares that Swan isn't any better than her. Swan continues on to Union Square and Mercy follows him. The Punks, who's leader wears roller skates, spot Swan on the subway platform and hang around waiting for their chance.Meanwhile, Snow and Cowboy have made it to Union Square and meet up with Cochise, Rembrandt and Vermin. Swan sees his fellow Warriors and signals them to lead the Punks into the men's room. They hide in the stalls, and ambush the Punks with Rembrandt's spray paint. The ensuing battle, which Mercy joins on the Warriors' side, is another victory for the Warriors.Back at the Riff's headquarters, Masai is told that there is a new witness who saw who really shot Cyrus.The six remaining Warriors board the final train home, with Mercy still in tow. Two young couples in evening dress coming from a school prom present such a contrast to Swan and Mercy that Swan takes pity on Mercy and clumsily signals that he accepts her. One of them drops a flower and Swan picks it up.Upon arrival at Coney Island, the sun has risen, and the journey is seemingly over. Swan gives Mercy the flower he'd picked up on the train, saying he hates seeing beautiful things go to waste. The Warriors and Mercy walk through the deserted Coney Island streets, only to realize that Luther and the Rogues are following them in a hearse. With no time to contact other members to come to their defense, the Warriors take shelter under a dock. Swan now has a switchblade he took from the Punk leader; the others arm themselves with what's around: Furies baseball bats, crowbars, hockey sticks, two-by-four pieces of wood, etc. Luther makes an ominous rattling sound with beer bottles and chants ""Warriors, come out to play-ay!""Swan leads his crew and Mercy out to the beach, and the Rogues follow. Finally face to face, Swan asks Luther why he killed Cyrus, to which the crazed Luther replies: ""No reason. I just... like doing things like that."" When Luther pulls a gun on Swan, he manages to flick his knife into Luther's wrist, disarming him. At that moment, the Gramercy Riffs appear in force on the beach. Swan asks whether the Riffs are still looking for the Warriors, to which Masai replies, looking at Luther, that they have found what they're looking for. Masai praises the Warriors as ""good, real good,"" and makes an exit path for them. They file out to the screams of Luther's death agonies.As the DJ announces that the alert is cancelled, the six surviving Warriors walk down their hometown beach, Swan hand-in-hand with Mercy. They are glad to have made it home, but are also emotionally defeated because they know that they and all the New York City gangs are back where they started from: nowhere."

Before leaving for the evening, Mrs. Mandrakis (Rutayna Alda) informs Jill that she and her husband, Dr. Mandrakis (Carmen Argenziano), might see a movie after dinner, which means they could be gone until midnight. She also requests that Jill not disturb the two children, who are asleep and recovering from a cold. During the evening, Jill remains downstairs and studies in the living room. After awhile, the telephone rings. When Jill answers, a man with a British accent asks, ""Have you checked the children?"" then hangs up. He calls back, repeating the question. As the same voice telephones several more times, Jill wonders if her friend, Bobby, is playing a practical joke. Rattled, she pours herself a glass of whiskey, then tries to reach Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis at the restaurant, but they already left. Next, she contacts the police, but the officer says he is unable to offer much help unless the caller threatens her. When Jill answers another time, the anonymous caller poises the question more emphatically.Sensing that the man is outside watching her, she closes the curtains and bolts the front door. She does not pick up as the phone rings again, then redials the police. Sgt. Sacker (Bill Boyett) reassures her that he will attempt to trace the call, and Jill manages to keep the stranger on the line for longer next time. As soon as he hangs up, the sergeant telephones and states that the call is coming from inside the house. He orders Jill to leave immediately. Looking up, she sees a man's shadow at the top of the stairs. She frantically opens the front door as the police arrive. The intruder upstairs is apprehended, but he is covered in the blood of the two Mandrakis children, whom he killed several hours earlier. By the time detective John Clifford (Charles Durning) appears on the scene, the parents have returned home and are trying to comprehend the tragedy. Officer Charlie Garber informs Clifford that the killer, a British citizen named Curt Duncan (Tony Beckley), used a second telephone line inside the house to call the babysitter, who was not hurt.Seven years later.Clifford has retired from the police force and works as a private investigator. Dr. Mandrakis hires him to find Duncan, who has recently escaped from the state mental hospital. Clifford questions Duncan's supervising physician, Dr. Monk (Rachel Roberts), who believes the patient is no longer a threat to children and feels confident that the intensive therapy, including electric shock treatment, was helpful, but Clifford would prefer clues as to the whereabouts of the psychopath.Meanwhile, at a bar downtown called Torchy's, Duncan tries to converse with a single, middle-aged woman named Tracy Fuller (Colleen Dewhurst), but she ignores him. When Duncan remains persistent, another bar patron assaults him. Tracy suddenly feels sympathy for the British man as he is dragged into the alley. Walking home alone that night, she is unaware that Duncan follows her. He appears outside her apartment door and apologizes for his behavior at the bar. Tracy is initially considerate until Duncan insists on staying and having coffee. After finally persuading him to leave, she feels unnerved by the stranger.At police headquarters, Clifford receives cooperation from his former colleague, Garber, who is now a lieutenant, and combs through recent crime reports. He also questions vagrants on the street and shows them a photograph of Duncan. After inquiring about the fight at Torchy's, Clifford tracks down Tracy and enlists her help in trapping the child murderer. Clifford then confides to Garber (Ron O'Neal) that he plans to kill Duncan and requests that the police do not get involved. Reluctantly, Garber agrees.As instructed, Tracy leaves Torchy's and walks back to her apartment alone at night, while Clifford watches for anyone following her. Duncan, however, does not appear. Nevertheless, Clifford assures Tracy that he will keep patrol outside her building. As Tracy settles in for the evening, Duncan, who has been hiding inside the apartment, surprises her and pleads with her for friendship. Hearing Tracy scream, Clifford storms into the apartment, but is unable to catch the killer as he flees. With a tip from a vagrant, Clifford locates Duncan at a homeless shelter, and the two men confront each other. Clifford aims a lethal lock needle towards the murderer, but Duncan dodges the weapon and escapes.Meanwhile, Jill Johnson still lives in Los Angeles, but is now married to Stephen Lockhart (Steven Anderson) and has two young children. As she prepares to cook dinner for the family, her husband telephones and announces that he is taking her to a restaurant. Jill then arranges for Sharon to babysit the children. While Jill and Stephen are enjoying dinner, the maître d' at the restaurant interrupts and informs the couple that they have a telephone call. When Jill picks up the receiver, the familiar voice with the British accent says, ""Have you checked the children?"" Jill screams that Curt Duncan is back, and Stephen immediately calls the babysitter, who assures the parents that everything is fine at home.Accompanied by a police officer, Stephen and Jill return to the house, and are relieved to find that the children are okay. Nevertheless, Stephen places a rifle by his bedside. Meanwhile, at police headquarters, Garber hears about the incident with Mrs. Lockart and alerts Clifford. When Clifford telephones the Lockhart home and receives a constant busy signal, the operator notifies him that the line appears to have been recently disconnected.Meanwhile, Jill cannot sleep. Checking on her son, she notices a piece of candy in his room that she did not give him. Frightened, she goes back to her bedroom. There, she hears Duncan's voice and assumes he is hiding in the closet. She shakes her husband in the bed, but instead, Duncan jumps out from underneath the covers. As the killer tries to strangle Jill, Clifford suddenly arrives and shoots Duncan dead. The private investigator comforts Jill and assures her that Stephen, who was knocked unconscious and placed in a closet, is fine."
tt0080139,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","On board his millionaire father's tanker ship, Nick Kegan (Jeff Bridges) phones his lover, Yvette Malone (Belinda Bauer), and leaves a message on her answering machine. Just then, a family associate named Keifetz (Richard Boone) arrives on the ship by helicopter with a man wrapped in bandages. Inside a doctor's office, the injured man, Arthur Fletcher (Joe Spinell), mutters a confession as an orderly transcribes; Fletcher had assassinated Nick's half-brother, the President of the United States, on February 22, 1960. Fletcher claims that he and one other gunman were hired by a man named Casper, Jr., for the job, after which Fletcher hid his rifle in Room 903 of the Engleson Building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Fletcher did so because he waned to be able to prove that he was the real killer. Nick inquires about Willie Arnold, the assassin who was determined to be the lone gunman by the Pickering Commission. However, Fletcher dies before he can answer so Nick heads to Philadelphia to look for the rifle.At the Engleson Building, Nick uncovers the weapon, but, just as he and his companions prepare to leave, a young woman on a bicycle (Barbara Richert) rides past their vehicle and pops her chewing gum. In an instant, Nick's associates are shot dead by an unseen sniper. Panicked, Nick runs to call his father, Pa Kegan (John Huston), but instead is connected to John Cerruti (Anthony Perkins), the mastermind behind the Kegan empire. When Nick reports the incident and his whereabouts, Cerruti promises to send help, but the vehicle and the rifle inside are stolen by an unseen person as Nick waits.Sometime later, Nick is chauffeured to Pa Kegan's desert estate, where he is greeted by the Japanese butler, Keith (Toshirô Mifune). Later that evening, Nick sees his emotionally unstable mother, Emma (Dorothy Malone), and is rebuked by his father for leaving the ship. When Nick reports Fletcher's confession and the incident in Philadelphia, his father storms away. However, Pa wakes Nick in the morning with a plan to expose the assassination conspiracy.Sometime later, Pa sends Nick to meet his former political rival and one of the richest men in the U.S., Z. K. Dawson (Sterling Hayden). Driving into Dawson's Tulsa, Oklahoma, ranch, Nick is cornered by WW II tanks. Dawson surfaces from a hatch, arguing that he was not involved with the assassination and implicating the Philadelphia Police Departments Captain Heller and his sidekick, Ray Doty (Michael Thoma).On an airplane to New York City, Nick receives a call from Pa, who reports that they no longer have witnesses to Fletcher's confession; Keifetz was killed and the ship's orderly broke his neck in a fall. Sometime later, Nick meets Doty, who remembers that the man implicated in Fletcher's confession, Casper, Jr., was connected to the Philadelphia police through a club owner named Joe Diamond (Eli Wallach). According to Doty (in a long flashback sequence to the 1950s), Diamond bribed Captain Heller (Brad Dexter) for access into the police station so he could kill Willie Arnold after the presidential assassination. Gangster Gameboy Baker (Ralph Meeker) arranged the assassination because the president did not return favors for the mafia's $2 million campaign contribution and Arnold was their scapegoat.Sometime after his meeting with Doty, Nick returns to New York City and makes love to Yvette. In the throes of passion, the young woman agrees to marry him but later retracts her promise, claiming that Nick is more intimate with her answering machine. When Nick returns home to his apartment, he is attacked by his maid, but he gains the upper hand and has her detained.At lunch the next day, Nick asks Yvette to help him track down Diamond through National Magazine, the magazine for which she works. Soon, Yvette directs Nick to a Cleveland, Ohio, diner, where he meets gangster Irving Mentor (Irving Selbst) and bribes him for information. Mentor reports that Casper, Jr., figured in the assassination because he was connected to a Hollywood studio that lost $50 million when one of their stars killed herself over an affair with the president. Just then, the same woman on the bicycle who popped her gum before the shootings in Philadelphia brings a dead cat into Mentor's diner and Nick chases after her as the restaurant explodes. The unknown woman again gets away.Nick returns to New York City, where Pa debunks Mentor's story and orders Nick to meet with imprisoned gangster Frank Mayo (Tomas Milian), who was given special leave for the interview. When Mayo suggests that Nick is being misled, Nick heads to National Magazine headquarters and learns that Yvette is not actually an employee. Later, the hostile doorman (Joe Ragno) at Yvette's apartment insists that she does not live there.Returning home, Nick finds Keifetz, who admits that he faked his death and encourages Nick to use Cerruti's intelligence connections to find Yvette. At Pa's financial headquarters, Cerutti tells Nick that Yvette was kidnapped by Casper Jr., and recounts a new version of the assassination. According to Cerruti (in another flashback sequence), a Washington, D.C. madam named Lola Comante (Elizabeth Taylor), who obliged the president's fondness for sex, offered him a $2 million campaign contribution from Mayo and his mafia associates. When the president discovered that Pa was behind the deal, he ended their relationship, leaving Pa financially and emotionally devastated.Changing the story yet again, Cerruti confesses that he arranged for Nick to meet a fraudulent Z. K. Dawson in Tulsa. The real Dawson and his daughter, Yvette, were the true perpetrators of the assassination; Yvette, formerly known as Maggie Dawson, was the president's mistress. Nick discounts Cerruti's story and insists on learning Yvette's whereabouts. As Nick fractures Cerruti's arms with a baton, he breaks down. Cerutti claims that Pa spent millions of dollars to support his son's presidency because it benefited him financially, but he was displeased by the president's liberal politics and so it was Pa who had him killed. Pa created an elaborate hoax to confuse Nick, including the employment of an actress named Jenny O'Brien to play the role of Yvette. When Cerruti says that Jenny is ""tied up"" at Kegan Medical School, Nick leaves... only to find her body in the morgue.Sometime later, Nick confronts his father in his office, but Pa claims that Cerruti masterminded the assassination to augment the Kegan coffers and blackmailed Pa into keeping quiet. When Nick attempts to call the police, Keifetz and an officer break into Pa's office and Nick thinks the men are there to back him up; however, Pa announces that Keifetz is an assassin with orders to kill Nick. Defending himself, Nick grabs the officer and uses his gun to fire at Keifetz, who shoots back at the officer as he dies. Nick chases his father onto the high-rise balcony and finds Pa clinging to the rail of an enormous American flag. As Nick reaches for his father, Pa falls to his death, tearing the flag in half with his body as he calls out to Nick: ""put my money in South America!"". Nick staggers away, but tells the secretary that he will return because he cannot escape his family ties.Sometime later in the final scene, Nick calls Yvette's answering machine to hear her voice one last time."
tt0080149,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'Not', 'Rated']","The story of Woyzeck begins ""in a small town, on a large, still pond."" We are then introduced to Franz Woyzeck (Klaus Kinski) as he is performing a military drill in full uniform-running, pushups, etc. Immediately after, he is seen giving the Captain a shave (Wolfgang Reichmann). The Captain is thinking aloud to Woyzeck about what characterizes a ""good person."" He first comments that Woyzeck works too quickly, then criticizes Woyzeck for having a child without the church's blessing. Woyzeck defends himself by quoting Matthew 19:14 from The Bible. The Captain says then that he was referring to Woyzeck, not to his son. Woyzeck claims that poor people have no use for morals, and that their kind suffers in both this world and the next. ""Even if poor people were to get into heaven, they would have to work the thunder."" The Captain responds by telling Woyzeck that he has no virtue. Woyzeck explains that poor people have no virtue, and do only what comes naturally to them. The Captain complains about Woyzeck thinking too much and comments that he has a ""hunted"" disposition. He then explains that a good person does not behave as though he is being hunted. A good person is one of virtue. As the Captain stands to leave, he tells Woyzeck that he is a good person, but always seems so hunted. He dismisses him, telling him to go slowly. Woyzeck, however, leaves in a rush as usual.Next, we see him under a tree with his fellow soldier and friend, Andres (Paul Burian). The two are whittling sticks for the Captain as Woyzeck hears a noise. After looking around, he grabs Andres by the hand and the two crouch behind the tree branches. Andres asks Wozyeck if he can still hear the sound, and Woyzeck replies, ""Still. Everything is still...as if the world were dead.""In the next scene, Woyzeck's mistress, Marie (Eva Mattes), is watching a parade on the street below from her apartment window. As she stands there with her friend Margret (Irm Hermann) and her son, the band on the street approaches and the two women take notice of the attractive Drum Major (Josef Bierbichler). As the band passes their building, the Drum Major makes eye-contact with Marie and begins singing in an operatic style. Margret and Marie begin to discuss ""what a man"" he is-with the ""paws of a lion."" Margret comments about how the two noticed each other, saying that Marie looks at him as she looks at no other man, with glistening eyes. Marie becomes offended, and tells Margret that she should take her eyes to the Jew to have them polished, so they would glisten as well. Margret claims to be an honorable person, and claims that Marie ""looks through leather pants."" Moments later, Franz enters, carrying the sticks he was whittling, and Marie notices that he seems disturbed. She asks him if he was out collecting wood for the Captain again, and He explains to Marie that ""it"" was there again and it followed him. He tells her he cannot stay long because he must go to mass that evening. After he leaves, Marie comments that he seems absent, and Margret notices that he did not even acknowledge his son. Marie says that she believes his thoughts could drive him crazy. She then asks her son why he is so quiet, and if he is scared. Franz is then seen at the Doctor's (Willy Semmelrogge) office. The Doctor scolds Woyzeck for urinating on the wall outside ""like a dog."" Woyzeck explains that he was only answering the call of nature, but the Doctor tells him that mankind is free, and he has therefore committed an act of betrayal. The Doctor asks Woyzeck if he has been consistent in his peas-only diet. He tells him that they will add mutton to his diet the following week. The Doctor exclaims that they will revolutionize science, and asks Woyzeck for a urine sample. Woyzeck is unable to urinate, and begins telling of his apocalyptic visions to the Doctor. He says that a ""frightful voice"" spoke to him. He then says that the world will be completely dark when ""nature is over."" The Doctor comments on his beautiful fixed idea, and gives him a raise of an extra dime for the next week. Woyzeck stands, staring blankly into space. Next, we see Franz in his formal blue uniform with Marie and their son at the carnival. The two walk around, looking at the various attractions, Franz holding their son. The Drum Major is also their with a Lower Officer (Herbert Fux). Marie notices them as they stop near a man playing an organ grinder. She half-smiles at them, but says nothing to them or to Franz. They follow Woyzeck and his family into a show featuring a teachable horse. The man hosting the show draws their attention with a small monkey dressed as a soldier, claiming that he is the ""lowest rank of soldier."" He then invites them to see the horse, and the Drum Major and Lower Officer have a brief conversation about how attractive Marie is, saying that she is ideal for breeding young drum majors, as they follow her and Franz into the tent. The host presents an ""astronomical horse"" that can put any educated human to shame, and asks the horse a few questions. He asks first if there is a jackass present. The horse nods. He then asks the horse what 2x2 is, and the horse taps its hoof four times. Lastly, he says that the horse will tell the time, and asks the group for a watch so that he may verify the horse's guess. The Lower Officer offers his watch, and Marie asks to see it. He tells her that he is not going to give it to her, and she gets up to go to him. The Drum Major picks her up as she is walking over the benches, and lowers her down next to him, telling those around them, ""This is a woman."" Marie gazes into his eyes, giggling, and the next scene shows them alone in Marie's kitchen. Marie has him march around, and compliments his ""bull-like chest"" and ""lion-like paws."" She claims he is the epitome of manliness, and he tells her that she should see him on Sunday at the dance with his plume and gloves. He then begins touching her breasts while remarking what an amazing woman she is, and that they should make a brood of young drum majors together. She tells him to stop at first, but does not resist as he attempts to undress her a second time.There is an abrupt transition to the next scene in which Woyzeck is helping the Doctor with an experiment. The Doctor is attempting to demonstrate to a group of students how a cat reacts on instinct when dropped from a high window. The Doctor is lecturing a group of students on the street from a second story window, while Woyzeck is inattentively standing off to the left side of the screen. He commands Woyzeck to stand directly below the window as he throws the cat, and Woyzeck catches the cat. The cat deficates on Woyzeck, and he begins shaking uncontrollably. The Doctor has Woyzeck sit on a bench, and invites the students to feel his pulse and observe the various results of the pea-experiment as he explains the experiment to them. They notice his irregular pulse, and the Doctor tells him to wiggle his ears to demonstrate that he uses different muscle groups to do so. Woyzeck tells the doctor he is fainting, and the Doctor becomes upset. He explains to the audience that this is part of the ""transformation to a donkey,"" and notices his hair loss. The story shifts back to Marie, who is sitting in front of her mirror with her son, admiring the shiny earrings the Drum Major gave her. She puts the boy to bed and sings him a lullaby before returning to the mirror to admire her earrings once more, saying how nice they will be for the dance. As she sits there, she compares her life to the lives of wealthier women. The boy wakes up, and Marie puts him back to sleep. Franz enters quietly and startles Marie as she is bent over the child's bed. She immediately covers her earrings, and Franz asks about them. Marie claims to have found them, and defends herself by saying that she is ""only human."" Franz tells her it is okay, gives her his pay for the day, and leaves. Marie says ""God bless you"" to him, and is left crying, claiming that she is a bad person and saying that she could stab herself.In the following scene, The Captain is walking down the sidewalk. The Doctor rushes past, and the Captain tries to stop him. The Doctor claims to be in a hurry, but the Captain tells him that good people are never in a hurry. Once the Doctor stops, the Captain explains that he feels melancholy. The Doctor observes the Captain is bloated and fat with a thick neck. He concludes that he has suffered a stroke, is already half-paralyzed, and will be a vegetable within four weeks. He will, however, make a fine subject for medical research. The Captain tells the Doctor to stop scaring him, and begins to imagine the sight of his own funeral. Just then, Woyzeck walks by, and the Captain invites him to stay and converse. He says that Woyzeck runs through life like a razor, and should be careful, lest he cut somebody. He asks Woyzeck if he has found any hair in his soup recently...particularly the hair of a drum major. Woyzeck turns pale and the Doctor begins making observations about his irregular pulse, angry facial expressions, and body tension. Woyzeck begins rambling about how cold hell is. He comments on the nice weather, saying that the sky is solid and gray. He says that it is so solid, one could drive a peg into it and hang himself from it. He finally leaves in a hurry, and the Doctor follows. The Captain is left saying that he does not like the fact that people confuse him. He says that a good man pays attention, loves his life, and has no courage. He says that he only joined the military to affirm his love of life, then walks away, laughing.When Woyzeck arrives at home, Marie is scrubbing the floor. As Franz approaches her, she freezes, and he picks her up slowly by the arm. As she stands, he looks at her, and says, ""Ah, it's still you."" She tells him that he is scaring her, and he begins to question her about the Drum Major. Franz asks how he touched her and where he stood. as he is doing so, he immitates the Drum Major's actions, standing closely to Marie, and groping her. He then places his head on Marie's shoulder and tells her that he wishes he were the Drum Major. The two begin to argue, and Franz raises his arm to hit Marie. She tells him she would rather have a knife in her body than be touched by his hand. Franz walks away from Marie, saying that there should be a sign on her. Franz then goes to talk with Andres. He sits nervously on a stool in an office as Andres is writing in a book. Woyzeck goes to the window, and tells Andres that they are dancing. Andres casually tells him that they are at The White Horse, and Woyzeck decides to go to Marie while she is at the dance. He arrives to find Marie dancing with the Drum Major and saying ""Don't stop, don't stop."" Franz thinks aloud outside, saying that they fornicate before his eyes like flies on his hand. He quickly runs away as a drunk sitting next to him wakes up. The man stands and delivers a soliloquy about a man thinking about the purpose of life. He says that everyone has been created by God. He says that soldiers were created to kill their own kind, and therefore, everything of the earth is evil. He ends by saying, ""Let us piss a cross, so that a Jew dies."" We then see Woyzeck running through a field, saying to himself ""Don't stop, don't stop."" He throws himself on the ground, listening to the earth, which is telling him to ""stab dead."" He slowly stands, thinking about it. He runs away, again reciting, ""Don't stop, don't stop.In the next scene, Woyzeck is seated in a bar, with the Drum Major sitting behind him. The Drum Major begins bragging about how much of a man he is. He addresses Woyzeck, threatening to knock his nose into his ass. He approaches Woyzeck, insisting that he drink, because a man must drink. He grabs Woyzeck by the face, and attempts to pour the drink into his mouth. Woyzeck refuses and hits the Drum Major on the cheek. The Drum Major grabs Woyzeck, and squeezes the air out of Woyzeck before releasing him. He pats Woyzeck on the head, and sits back down. Woyzeck leaves the bar saying ""One thing at a time.""Woyzeck lies awake that night in the barracks, hallucinating. He hears voices in his head saying, ""Don't stop, don't stop!"" and ""Stab, stab!"" He awakens Andres, asking if he can hear it. Andres tells him to let them dance, and goes back to sleep. Franz says that he has a pain between his eyes like a knife, and Andres tells him to go back to sleep. Franz lies awake, shaking. Marie also sits awake in her kitchen reading from John 8 in the Bible. She reads the passage in which Jesus forgives the prostitute of her sins, and asks the Lord to not look at her. She comments that Franz did not come home that night or the night before. The next day, Woyzeck asks Andres if he had heard the voices the night before. After Andres says no, Woyzeck says that ""She was a special girl,"" and hurries away and purchases a knife from a Jewish merchant. The merchant tells him that the knife is in good condition and straight. He brags that it is cheap, and would bring an ""economic death."" Woyzeck then returns to the barracks and gives his belongings away to Andres. He empties out a chest near his bed, giving him a ring, a crucifix, and other religious relics. Franz sits on the chest, and reads his birth certificate aloud. Andres remarks that Woyzeck does not look well, and should go to the infirmary. The scene then transitions to Marie, who sits, and tells a story to a group of children. She tells of a child who was completely alone in the world. The child went to the moon, but found it to be a piece of rotted wood. Then, the child went to the sun, which was only a wilted sunflower. The child then went to the stars, but found that they were only small golden bugs. Finally, the child returned to the earth, but found that it was only an overturned cauldron. The child sat, and began to cry. At the end of the story, Franz approaches Marie, and tells her it is time to go.The two walk down to the pond, and Marie tells Franz she wants to go home. Franz asks Marie how long they have been together, and how long she thinks their relationship will last. He then remarks that she has the breath of a whore. Marie notices how red the moon is, and also that Franz seems to be up to something. At that moment, he pulls out the knife and stabs her. She screams, and he stares into her eyes. Once she is on the ground, he continues to stab her. Franz sits, staring at her and weeping, and then panics and runs back toward the town. He runs into a bar, where he sits and talks with a woman. She sits on his lap, and he notices that she is also hot, like Marie. He tells her that she, too, will be cold in the end. Franz asks the woman to sing, and she notices the blood on his sleeve, and draws attention to it. Woyzeck claims that he cut himself, and wiped it off. The bartender notices that it covers his arm up to the elbow. Woyzeck runs away, and returns to the pond. Wanting to hide the evidence, he searches frantically for the knife. He pauses, and bends over Marie, touching her hair. He then finds the knife, and throws it into the water. Thinking it will be too easy to find, he goes into the stream to throw it into deeper water, and notices stains on his clothing. He goes even deeper into the water, trying to wash the blood off. The scene then shifts to the next day. Officials are investigating the scene of Marie's death. The film ends here, as the original was left unfinished at Georg Büchner's death."

tt0080180,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'History', 'War']","The film is set in British South Africa, in the province of Natal, in January 1879. The first half of the film revolves around the administrators and officials of Cape Colony, notably the supremely arrogant Lord Chelmsford (Peter O'Toole) and the scheming Sir Henry Bartle Frere (John Mills), who both wish to crush the neighbouring Zulu Empire, which is perceived as a threat to Cape Colony's emerging industrial economy. Bartle Frere issues an impossible ultimatum to the Zulu king, Cetshwayo (Simon Sabela), demanding that he dissolve the Zulu Empire. Cetshwayo refuses, providing Cape Colony with a pretext to invade Zululand. Despite objections from leading members of Cape Colony's high society and from Great Britain itself, Bartle Frere authorises Lord Chelmsford to lead a British invasion force into Zululand.The second half of the film focuses on the British invasion of Zululand and the lead-up to the climatic Battle of Isandlwana. The invading British army, laden with an immense network of supply wagons, invades Zululand and marches in the direction of Ulundi, the Zulu capital. British forces, eager to fight a large battle in which they can unleash their cutting-edge firearm military technology against the vast Zulu army, become increasingly frustrated as the main Zulu army refuses to attack the British, and fighting is restricted to a few small skirmishes between British and Zulu scouts.Concerned that their supply lines are becoming overstretched and that the main Zulu army is still at large, British troops begin torturing captive Zulu warriors in an effort to learn the location and tactics of the Zulu army. Halfway to Ulundi, Chelmsford halts his army at the base of Mount Isandhlwana, ignoring the advice of Boer attendants to entrench the camp and laager the supply wagons, leaving the camp dangerously exposed. During the night, Colonel Durnford (Burt Lancaster) and an escort of 50 mounted Basutos approach the camp. Lord Chelmsford then orders Durnford to return to his unit, bringing them to the camp immediately to reinforce Colonel Pulleine (Denholm Elliott). Lt. Vereker (Simon Ward) should join Durnford as aide-de-camp.Reacting to false intelligence, Chelmsford leads half of the British army, including the best infantry, cavalry and artillery units, on a wild goose chase far from the camp, in pursuit of a phantom Zulu army. On the day of battle (January 22), Durnford and his troops are arriving at 11:00 a.m. at the camp at Isandlwana. Meanwhile, the Zulu captives escape their torturers and regroup with the Zulu army, informing them of the British army's direction and strength. After having lunch with Colonel Pulleine and Lt. Vereker, Durnford quickly decides to send Vereker to scout the hills. Durnford then decides to take his own command out from the camp too, and scout the iNyoni heights.The entire Zulu army is later discovered by men of Lt. Vereker's troop of scouts, who chase a number of Zulu herdsmen, trying to hurry away their cattle, only to discover the main Zulu enemy force of thousands at the bottom of a valley. Lt. Vereker then sends Lt. Raw to warn the camp that it is about to be attacked.As Zulu impis descend upon the camp, Durnford's cavalry retreat to a donga in an effort to hold back the Zulu advance. Forced back, the British take heavy casualties, including the battery of Congreve rockets, which is overrun by the Zulus. Initially, the British infantry succeed in defending the camp, and Zulu forces retreat under a hail of artillery and small arms fire. British units defending the camp are now becoming dangerously spread-out, and are oblivious to Zulu forces moving round the sides of the mountain in an encircling move.As British infantrymen begin to run out of ammunition and the British cavalry are driven back towards the camp, Zulu warriors charge the British troops en masse, sustaining horrific casualties, but succeed in breaking the British lines. As British troops break and flee towards the camp, the battle breaks down into hand-to-hand fighting between British soldiers and Zulu warriors, amongst the débris of tents, fallen soldiers and supply wagons. Overwhelmed by the sheer number of Zulu warriors, British soldiers and their African allies are slaughtered in the camp, some being cut down as they attempt to flee back towards Natal. Colour-Sergeant-Major Williams (Bob Hoskins) sees many of his redcoated men being cut down by Zulu spears. Williams is stabbed in the back by a spear while attempting to save the life of one of his young soldiers, and having killed several Zulu soldiers with his bayonet after he runs out of ammo, dies at the hands of a large band of Zulus.As the British forces break apart, the one-armed Durnford becomes trapped in the camp. Hoping to save his men, Durnford orders his African cavalrymen to retreat. Remaining on foot at the battlefield, Durnford is killed alongside his infantrymen.During the last minutes of the battle, Colonel Pulleine entrusts the Queen's Colours of the 2nd battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot to two junior officers, Lts. Melvill (James Sebastian Faulkner) and Coghill (Christopher Cazenove), who attempt to carry them to safety in Natal, passing gruesome scenes as Zulu warriors hunt down British and African infantrymen attempting to flee across the river. While crossing the Buffalo River, the three lieutenants are cut down by Zulus. Coghill accompanies Melvill in his attempt to gallop the Union Flag back towards Natal. When Melvill nearly drowns while trying to cross the Buffalo River, Coghill turns to help him, and is ambushed by Zulu warriors. Coghill attempts to defend himself with his revolver, but is killed. Melvill is assegaied by Zulu warriors while defending the flag.The Colours (a Union Flag embroidered with the Regiment's insignia) are captured. In his dying moments, Vereker shoots and kills the Zulu wielding the Colours, and the Colours fall gracefully into the river, where they are carried out of reach. Vereker's fate remains unknown (though it is implied that he too gets killed).Seeing the battle lost, Pulleine returns to his tent to pen a last letter to his wife. He is discovered by one of the escaped Zulu prisoners and, unwilling to kill the young soldier, the elderly Pulleine allows himself to be killed in his tent by the Zulu and other warriors that storm in.In the evening, Chelmsford and the rest of the British army return to Isandlwana, to be greeted by the sight of their slaughtered comrades, and the news that a mass Zulu army has invaded Natal and laid siege to Rorke's Drift. Charles L. Norris-Newman (Ronald Lacey), a war correspondent for 'The Standard' also views the devastation (having accompanyed Chelmsford's expecition and so avoid the battle/massacre. The film ends with Zulu warriors in a silhouetted victory procession, dragging captured British artillery back to Ulundi."

I began shooting it during the Prague Spring in 1968, but the communist censorship stopped it right before it was finished. I was only allowed to finish it 22 years later! During the shooting I was more and more sure of the fact that this film will be unacceptable for the censors. Therefore I focused on the aesthetics of storytelling, using symbols and double meanings. I didnt know that in fact it wouldnt be censors deciding about this film, but instead the political powers. In this period of realization the circle was drawing tighter not only around me but also around the whole Czechoslovak art community. See You in Hell, My Friends! was the last sentence for friends and the whole intelligentsia, the scream of the hopeless who felt the freedom of the world was over forever.1 hour 20 minutes / Color

tt0128446,['Drama'],"""San Gottardo"" is first and foremost a film about emigration, the ""exodus"" brought about by the construction of the two Gothard tunnels - the railway tunnel (1872-1882) and the road tunnel (1969-1976). People migrated from one country to another, from one civilization to another, and different social mores and customs were confronted with one another.
My intention was to show the parallels between the two tunnel constructions and to make economic, financial and social comparisons. Documentary and acted sections are interspersed.
History - the past - is interpreted by actors in almost static image sequences. The present is depicted by documentary film sections.
We filmed the tunnel workers daily during the period of a month, and attempted to depict their work, their free time, and their problems. The workers subsequently viewed the rushes and discussed it with us. Later, the same documentary film workers acted some parts of the workers of the last century in the feature film sections. This mixture between professionals and lay actors was very important to me.
The film takes place between the unveiling of two monuments: it begins with the unveiling of the monument dedicated to the tunnel workers in Airolo in 1932, (incidentally, this is a film rarity, a kind of early Swiss newsreel which was rescued from destruction by the Swiss railways official) and it ends with the unveiling of the Escher monument on the Zurich Bahnhofstrasse, (Alfred Escher was the founder of the bank ""Swiss Credit"" and promoter of the Gothard Railway Company).
In between the two unveiling, the film depicts the essence of that which lay behind the veiling cloth, and the way in which the construction of the Gothard tunnels was determined by both the bourgeoisie and the working classes."

Dee offers Dink her place to stay in for a while, and desperate to have a bed to sleep in, Dink agrees.

Cardone first show his strength by stopping a bank robbery, making them surrender and release the hostages at the same time. When a rich boy is kidnapped, he stops the family from paying the ransom, and when the boy's body is found, he is also capable of proving that the kidnappers would have killed the boy anyway.
But when the kidnappers gang kidnaps his son, he has to decide whether to stick to his principles or follow his feelings. His decision will lead him to discover corruption at the highest levels of the police administration; and Cardone makes the hard decision to enforce the law, even if that means putting is his son, or other innocents, in danger."

tt0195644,"['Animation', 'Musical']","""Dick Deadeye"" Or ""Duty Done""This is an animated cartoon designed by Ronald Searle and directed by Bill Mendelez based upon a pastiche-compilation of several Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, being 'HMS Pinafore' (HMP), 'Iolanthe' (Io), 'The Mikado' (M), 'Patience' (P), 'The Pirates of Penzance' (PoP), 'Ruddigore' (R), 'The Sorcerer' (S), 'Trial by Jury' (TbJ), and 'Utopia Limited' (ULtd). The words and music are both adapted from the originals by Robin Miller and Leo Rost. The voice actors are credited.Able Seaman Dick Deadeye (Victor Spinetti: HMP) is commissioned by Queen Victoria to regain the ""Ultimate Secret"" (U.S.) which has been stolen by the Sorcerer (Peter Reeves: S) and his reptilian sidekick, the Shameleon, and which is being offered by them to The Pirate King (George Cooper, sung Ian Samwell: PoP).Dick spots the Sorcerer and the King conferring at a military parade ('Entrance of the Peers'; 'Bow, bow ye lower middle classes': Io), where also good Japanese Nanki (John Newton, sung Casey Kelly: M) spots his evil identical twin brother Poo (also John Newton / Casey Kelly: M) pick-pocketing the crowd. Dick hurries to the military H.Q., the Hexagon, to find help ('Here's a how-dee-do': M) where he meets the Captain (Peter Reeves: HMP) and they both go to see The Major-General (Francis Ghent, sung John Baldry: PoP: 'I am the very model of a modern major general': PoP) who also charges Dick with the recovery of the U.S..Dick hurries to the pirates' hang-out, ""The Queen's Nose"", ('Oh, better far to live and die': PoP) where Rose Maybud (Julia McKenzie, sung Liza Strike: R), the barmaid, is on the lookout for ""a man of pure evil, so I can reform him"". She spots Dick ('Prithee, pretty maiden': P) but drops him when she finds he's good. The Sorcerer and Shameleon arrive ('My name is John Wellington Wells' (JWW): S: ""I counsel on etiquette / You'll eat spaghetti, yet"") and agree to sell the U.S. to the Pirate King in exchange for the (rather small) remaining pirate treasure. The Sorcerer goes to fetch the U.S., followed by Dick and some pirates, whom he eludes: and the Shameleon attracts a Cat as a lover.At the Sorcerer's shop (JWW: S reprise), Dick distracts the Sorcerer with a request for a potion to make him handsome ('Sprites of earth and air': S), and tries to steal the U.S., but it and the Shameleon are knocked out of the window into the basket of Little Buttercup (Miriam Karlin: HMP), a buxom ribbons-, bangles-, and marine-supplies-vendor in a low-cut purple-striped dress. The basket is stolen by Poo, and all give chase, including a posse of three policemen ('A policeman's lot is not a happy one': PoP), but they actually catch Nanki instead and drag him off to trial.At the Courts of Justice, the Judge (Barry Cryer: TbJ: 'All hail great Judge': 'Now, Jurymen, hear my advice', both TbJ) falls for Little Buttercup ('I'm called Little Buttercup': HMP) and having been bored with Nanki's evidence ('A wandering minstrel I': M; and 'I swear to tell the truth' based on 'When I go out of door': P) sends Nanki to the Tower of London for 200 years (""How guilty do you find the defendant?"" ""Very guilty!"" ""Very proper"".), before exiting the Court in triumph ('A Judge is he, and a good judge too': TbJ) with Little Buttercup.At the Tower of London, escorted by the Yeoman of the Guard (another G&S operetta: 'Farewell the world': HMP) Nanki muses on his lot and lost love, Yum-Yum (Linda Lewis, sung Beth Porter: M), whose spirit is trapped in Nanki's shamisen or guitar ('Just as the moon must have the sun', based on 'The sun whose rays': M) awaiting Nanki to become ""a whole man, to make me a whole woman"". Poo meets the Sorcerer outside the Tower and agrees to return the U.S. in return for becoming his apprentice to learn all his tricks. The pirates capture them and take then to ""The Queen's Neck"", where it is found that the U.S. is in code: all agree that it shall be deciphered by the Sorcerer on board the pirate ship. Poo declares himself to be 'the most evil man in the world', the 'Terror of Titipu' - Rose decides to fall in love with him and reform him.Dick rushes back to the Hexagon to enlist aid: he finds the Rear-Admiral (Francis Ghent, sung John Baldry: HMP: 'I am the monarch of the sea', HMP) and his sisters and his cousins and his aunts, who promptly calls the Captain ('He remains an Englishman', HMP) and gives him command of the 'Pinafore', and also a permit to Dick to seek a crew amongst the condemned prisoners. Dick rushes to the Tower, to find Nanki entertaining the prisoners ('The flowers that bloom in the spring': M: Prisoner sung by Ian Samwell), where they almost all enlist.The pirates go on board their ship, together with the Sorcerer and Poo ('Pour, oh pour the pirate sherry': PoP); Rose Maybud sneaks aboard dressed as a pirate, and so does the Cat, which corners the Shameleon.The Captain is taken by the dignitaries (Judge, Major-General, Rear-Admiral 'When I was a lad': HMP) to the 'Pinafore', his first command ('We sail the ocean blue' and 'I am the Captain of the 'Pinafore'': both HMP), and indeed the first time he's been to sea. Little Buttercup outfits the crew, and the rats leave the ship.The 'Pinafore' gives chase to the pirate ship, aided by a couple of giant cherubs ('Go, ye heroes': PoP) - and Poo takes advantage of the ocean-motion (and a garlic sausage, mussels, butterscotch, bacon and cream pizza) to make the Sorcerer sick and hand over the U.S. - but when they catch up the crews are more inclined to welcome old friends rather than fight. The Captain and Pirate King do fight, but the King's pants fall down revealing a strawberry birthmark on his backside. Little Buttercup then reveals ('Many years ago': HMP) that when she was a nursemaid she mixed up the infant Captain (recognizable by the birthmark) and Pirate King so they now change clothes and places. However, neither now has the U.S..Poo has however now escaped with the U.S., to the nearby island of Utopia, so the combined crews follow ('With cat-like tread': PoP), coming across the scantily-clad Regent of Utopia, the Princess Zara (Miriam Karlin?: ULtd) and her court of show-girls, with whom they sing the double chorus (female 'Hail, hail, and how-dee-do', based on 'Come friends who plough the sea': PoP; with male counter-chorus 'Land of sand and sea and sun' - this is not G&S but in the style of the ""Beach Boys""). Zara has captured Poo: the Sorcerer offers to execute him, and steals the U.S. back: pursued into a small pond by Dick and the Captain, it is discovered from the reflection that the U.S. is in mirror-writing, and is: ""It's love that makes the world go round"" ('Nothing venture, nothing win': HMP).With the secret out, Nanki and Poo become merged into one person ""man is composed of both good and evil"", and the spirit of Yum Yum (the missing Queen of Utopia - who else?) is released from Nanki-Poo's shamisen: the Sorcerer falls for Little Buttercup, and Dick and Rose Maybud are reunited. The U.S. being revealed world-wide, war and crime cease ('Here's a how-dee-do': M) and the dignitaries arrive by hot-air balloon to start an idyllic existence with the island girls. The Shameleon and its lover the Cat steal the balloon, which floats off as the credits roll ('Entrance of the Peers', Io, reprise)."

It is obvious from the outset that the film makers are staunch supporters of legalization and probably would advocate free smoking for all! This does not make it any less of an informative documentary and if anything gives it a more realistic attitude to certain policies and opinions on the subject that are either dated or just not true. Then or now when we know so much more.It is interesting to hear 'experts' back then saying things that are still said by 'experts' today and that is that Marijuana is more harmless to society when it is a crime than if it were legal. That is also a debate that rolls on but the science supports the statement as fact. Debate or no debate.The film makers travel to Nepal, Vietnam, Cambodia and Mexico and see the attitudes of the natives to marijuana and hashish. Plus, I suspect, to enable themselves to buy and sample the different varieties on offer in these places.Overall this is a laid back, fun film to watch with great opportunity to see some of the old so called 'hash trail' that so many hippies went on to 'find themselves'.

tt0228694,['Drama'],"At the height of the Vietnam War, a talented group of young actors and anti-war activists joined forces with author Philip Dossick in an alliance that resulted in The P.O.W. This brilliantly staged free-ranging assault on Richard Nixon and the Vietnam War was made on an impossibly low budget with only a noisy Bolex 16mm camera and ancient Korean War surplus Kodak movie film-all in total opposition to commercial Hollywood cinema standards. The result was a film that stings to this day.Beginning with his (dehumanizing) discharge from the VA hospital, The P.O.W. portrays Howie Kaufman's painful attempts to reintegrate into his once familiar middle-class urban life. Howie is a decent young man who has been drafted into the war in Vietnam. He has returned home permanently paralyzed from the waist down.""I have to get a job. I have to find a place to live. I don't even know where to begin."" Howie says to his VA music therapist the night before his military discharge.""Yeah well... It might be rough at first,"" replies the therapist.""I know. That's the problem. But I have to face it eventually.""""You can do it soldier. You really can.""After that, we see him being wheeled around town by friends under grim Manhattan skies, desperately searching for a place to live and a job to keep him afloat. An obnoxious Eyewitness News documentary film crew follows closely behind recording every single humiliating morsel. The Wall St. Journal's Joy Gould Boyum called this leitmotif ""Cinema Verite's Orwellian Aspect.""In a piercing encounter with friends, Howie reluctantly explains that brutality and wanton violence are acceptable realities in Vietnam, but such realities make absolutely no sense to people back in the U.S. Consequently he is having no luck or sympathy finding work.Looking back nearly five decades later, the passage of time has only intensified the resonance of Dossick's singular creation. It is the ecstasy of the enterprise that seems most striking-an ecstatic engagement by all involved-both cast and crew-in those turbulent days-to create a work of art still very much alive with strength and relevance."
tt0230657,"['Drama', 'Romance']","This is one of those Dev Anand movies where everything is great except the plot. Amarjeet, the family friend of Anands, is the producer, so he could get the dates of Dev Saab and Zeenat Aman. In 1974, if you had already signed Dev Anand and Zeenat Aman , the financiers bee-lined to back the project.With the funds available in abundance, Amarjeet could hire Bindu, Anand Baxi, and Laxmi Kant Pyare Lal. It was quite common in late sixties and early seventies to sign highly sale-able stars and begin the shooting- and develop the plot as you go along. BR Ishara was chosen as the director. In my opinion, BR Ishara was a very good director but in the early seventies , his name was associated mainly with the adult movies. I could not see his films like Jaroorat, and Chetna because I was a minor then. So I only saw these movies when they came to the theaters for the second time. While Jaroorat is run of the mill stuff, Chetna is an excellent film with hardly any nudity in it. Ishara's Ek Nazar(Amitabh and Jaya) was also a good movie but not many viewers remember it.The main point is all Dev fans were surprised at BR Ishara directing a Dev Anand film.
For the sake of the convenience , I am only giving the names of the actors which should be taken to mean the characters played by them in the film
Dev Saab plays a famous novelist and the college girls are crazy to meet him. One such girl, Zeenat Aman, gets intimate with him; and they want to get married. The rest of the plot is how seemingly difficult or even impossible it is for the two lovers to unite in matrimony. First, Dev Saab is shown to be already married to Bindu-though it is a failed marriage because Bindu had lied to Dev Saab that she was carrying his child.Then, Bindu introduces Zeenat Aman to Dev Anand as her sister whom she had kept away for several years.Then, Zeenat tells Dev Saab that she is not Bindu's sister but she is her daughter. How can the hero marry the daughter of his wife from a previous marriage? When the hero braces up to take this extreme step, Bindu gives him another shock- that the Hero's brother Abhi Bhatacharya is Zeenat's father.So, how can the hero marry his niece?. But Hero and Heroine don't give up- they go to Abhi Bhatacharya to find out if Bindu was telling the truth. Abhi Bhatacharya says he is not Zeenat's father- her father is possibly one of the three gentlemen with whom the vamp slept before she was crowned Miss India in 1951.Bindu's true story is revealed- she had pleased three gentlemen-IS Johar, Rehman, and Shekhar- to win the Miss India contest. She marries Rehman who is the real father of her daughter. But as she wants freedom , she leaves Rehman and takes her daughter with her whom she leaves in the care of Sajjan in a hill station . After some time Bindu realizes that freedom to a woman can only be available within marriage, she compels Dev Anand to marry her. As she doesn't like the idea of Dev Anand divorcing her and marrying her daughter Zeenat , she sues him on the grounds that Dev Anand has abducted her minor daughter. Dev Saab pleads his own case and is able to prove in the court room that his marriage to Bindu is null and void because she never divorced her husband.And the biggest surprise of them all is that Zeenat is not Bindu's real daughter. Her real daughter is Anju Mahendru.
Dev Anand was fifty one but he didn't look a day older than twenty five.He had a great chemistry with the gorgeous heroine Zeenat, and he was outstanding in the court room scenes. Bindu was the top vamp at that time after her portrayal of Shabnam in Kati Patang, and Mona Darling in Zanjeer; but Ishara saab couldn't use her well. Among the character actors, Asit Sen is impressive in his role as the editor cum literary agent of the hero, and David shines in a cameo .Anju Mahendru is in a very small role but she looks super gorgeous which makes us wonder why Kaka left such a beauty. Laxmikant Pyarelal's music is very good- the best of course is ' Doston Mere Kisse' which has almost become an anthem for the alcohol lovers. The other songs like ' Mujhe Pyar Kar, and ' Pyar Hamara Manjoor Ho Gaya' are also very good.
Dev and Zeenat fans can watch this movie again."
tt0235848,['Drama'],"Uthiri Pookal is one movie that gets quoted so often when popular directors talk about the best tamil movie ever made.It is always a tricky proposition to come up with a negative character as the hero of a movie. It is as risky as walking on thin ice. One wrong move and you are destined for a nasty fall. Mahendran does this balancing act with so much elan that it leaves you spellbound to the script. The fact that Vijayan is not portrayed as the stereotypical villain adds to the authenticity of his character. What transpires on screen is a battle between a person who is sensitive enough to deeply love his kids and a person who can ruthlessly do anything to attain the things he has set his eyes on.The effort that has gone into etching each of the character of the movie pays rich dividend as it adds a lot of value to the storyline. The screenplay is something that many of the present day tamil directors can use as an example while writing their scripts. With a solid storyline, the onus was on the screenplay to make the movie interesting. The scenes are neatly placed that one scene gels into the next one very smoothly and without any hiccups. The tight closeup shots of the lead characters during the highly charged scenes shows the faith the director had in his actors and the actors have repaid the faith with some brilliant performances.The scenes where Vijayan slaps Aswini or Sarathbabu are not shown directly but are shown in a subtle and beautiful way. The sound followed by the heroine holding her hands to her face or Sarathbabu washing away the blood in the river are artistic and shows the director's ability to think beyond the ordinary. One another unsung hero of this movie is Ilayaraaja. For each character, he comes up with a brilliant theme music. Be it the ominous sounding tabla for Vijayan or the soft & sad music for Aswini or the funky bits for the second heroine, Ilayaraaja proves his mettle in the BGM department.This is a movie about human relations, love and the fall from grace of a person possessed by greed. A movie that should be watched for the sheer narrative style and honest story telling. A classic indeed!"

tt0269104,['Documentary'],"Born of talks with four hundred disaffected teenagers in the suburban belt around Toronto, the film reflects their recurring theme: ""Wouldn't it be great if we weren't hassled by parents and police, didn't go to prison-like schools and could just get out of this polluted city and into the coun¬try and hang out with a bunch of kids like ourselves."" Would it? The filmmakers invited five boys and five girls ages 13 to 19 to live on a farm for ten weeks, to be filmed, and to see what might emerge for each of them personally. In often subtle ways, each of the explorers discovered something about themselves. And, in a gentle, funny and touching way, the audience is allowed to re-experience what it is like to go through the stress and alienation of adolescence and come out whole on the other side. The film vividly captures the seismic shift in persona, social values and power from parents who grew up in the Depression and World War II to baby-boomers, who created a counter culture that dramatically altered the way we look at the world. The reshaping of family life, which the pill, divorce and new sexual mores produced: women working outside the home, the dramatic increase in wealth, the explosion of new suburbs and housing all brought new freedom and disturb¬ing stress.

tt0276861,"['Crime', 'Drama']","Chor Chor ( 1974) is a crime thriller with Vijay Anand and Leena Chandravarkar in lead roles.Produced by Vijay Anand, the film was directed by his long time associate Prem Prakash. It is a two hour suspense thriller without any songs in it, which is surprising because one always expects the Vijay Anand films to have a number of melodious and artistically filmed songs. The only thing close to a song in Chor Chor is that Goldie himself sings two or three lines of the House Number 44 song- Phaili Hui Hai Sapno Ki Rahe- in a party, and his voice is used by the villain to frame him in an act of bank robbery.
Aakash ( Goldie) is a bank manager, and his father (played by Iftekhar) is a retired police officer who tells his son one day that he saw a criminal named Chandan he thought had died twenty years ago. The same evening, the criminal attacks and kills Iftekhar who, before he dies, manages to tear a piece of the criminal's shirt collar. It is seen that the collar has the label of Stylo Tailor of Panchgani. Goldie gets himself transferred to the Panchgani branch of the bank so that he can investigate about the murder. There, he meets the beautiful girl Hema (Leena Chadravarkar) who , with her mother, runs a guest house. Goldie stays in this guest house as a paying guest which reminds the viewers of the film Kala Pani in which Dev Anand stays in a similar guest house in Hyderabad.
Right from the beginning, the viewer knows the killer(played by Trilok Kapoor, brother of Prithvi Raj Kapoor, and known mostly for his role as Lord Shiva in the religious films) .The killer also knows that the hero is looking for him. So the suspense is how would the hero figure out who the killer is .There are two sub plots and about half a dozen red herrings to keep the hero confused. The first sub plot is that the killer has a dual identity. He was a criminal Chandan, accused of five murders, but he is also seen as Dr. Dharam Veer of Panchgani who has secret plans to rob forty lac rupees from the local bank . It is the same bank where the hero Aakash has joined as a replacement to the regular bank manager (played by Jairaj) who is faking illness because he is blackmailed by the killer which brings us to the second sub plot. The killer knows that Jairaj is the biological father of the heroine as he was in love with the heroine's mother Kamala whose parents arranged her marriage with someone else. As Kamala was pregnant with Jairaj's child, her husband had a fight with Jairaj in which the latter unintentionally killed the former . This knowledge gives the killer doctor Dharam Veer leverage over Jairaj to make him confine himself to his house pretending to be a heart patient, for one month , so that the killer can rob the bank and put the blame on the hero Aakash( Goldie) .
There ensues a battle of wits between the hero and the killer and some interesting incidents take place like a threat letter typed from a typewriter with a defective key, and a letter shabbily written by a blind woman. The killer also manages that Aakash comes across a number of red herring suspects like an unknown lover of the heroine, a retired army colonel, the perpetual sharabi Keshto Mukherji, and the philanderer showroom owner, Vibhuti Bhushan (played by Mohan Sherry). The break through is when the hero comes to know that the killer , in spite of knowing who the hero is, doesn't kill him though he gets more than one opportunities to do so. He realizes that the killer wants to use him for some purpose before eliminating him. The hero changes his strategy and is able to outwit the killer in the end.
The best part of the movie is the divinely beautiful heroine Leena Chandravarkar, and the way the director has shown her courtship with the hero Goldie. It has been presented in an absolutely natural and decent manner, without any flamboyance or aggression on hero's part and without any coyness or nakhra( attitude) on heroine's part and without any nok jhonk or ladai jhagda( lovers' tiff) between them. Their first two meetings are when the hero is driving his car and the heroine wants to cross the road and they very politely signal- you go first. The heroine conveys that she is attracted to the hero by cooking the vegetables that he likes which she comes to know when he orders from a menu in a restaurant .Their relationship develops in a very smooth and mature fashion, and the way the hero makes a marriage proposal and the way the heroine accepts it is absolutely unique. It was totally devoid of the usual romantic trappings, yet it was absolutely engaging. Maybe this reflects Goldie's idea of an ideal woman, and the ideal format of man -woman relationship which should be based on respect, mutual understanding, and commitment.
Highly recommended."

His Presidential Assistant, Deshpal, recruits a busty Private Secretary, Ruby Dixsana, for Gangaram's nightly pleasure.On the issue of poverty, he decides that mice and rats eat food grains, and are, therefore responsible for this problem, so he instructs the Government to pay a reward of Ten Rupees for every dead mouse.Corrupt Government employees instead accept a One Rupee bribe in lieu of a dead mouse, and pay huge sums to the public.When Janta kills five mice, she becomes the only one to present physical evidence, and is ridiculed and given the runaround by officials.

tt0367950,['SciFi'],"The Lost Generation takes place in a future time in an over-populated New York City, where multiple, unrelated families share apartment space, and there is no 'real' food available to the general public, only artificial versions of eggs, wheat and vegetables, etc. Babies born without government permission are frozen and only under extraordinary circumstances are thawed and given to the parents (an example is to replace a child lost in a foreign 'military police action' type war, similar to a Vietnam type of conflict. One of the peripheral characters in the film has that happen, and the thawed child is never quite 'right'). There is only public transportation, such as overhead trains and subways, and moving sidewalks on which protesters 'march' with signs that say, ""legalize suicide"" and ""legalize abortion"" (not yet legal in the U.S. at the time movie was filmed). The premise of the movie is a race from one side of NYC to the other, put on by the criminally connected government of the country and city. The winner of this race will be given one acre of the last remaining Unite States National Park Land being distributed to the 'public' through these contests across the country. On this acre the winner would be allowed to have a cow and a couple of chickens and to grow vegetables. It is made clear that no one expects a regular everyday person to actually WIN, it is all a ploy to enable a big business type to have someone win the property for one of the big bosses so he can develop it with another high rise, such as those that have blocked the city so that one can no longer make it all the way across NYC without climbing buildings as if they were mountains because security will not allow anyone 'unconnected' inside them to pass through! The story's hero ( Stuart Whitman) decides to enter the race, and gets a variety of people to help him by promising to share the bounty he grows on his little farm with them if he wins. This captures the imagination of many hopeless people, who advance him things like a map of the old sewer system under the city, and providing climbing gear to get over the skyscrapers and other things, against these hopes of future returns. Just before he sets out on this contest race he discovers he has another incentive: his wife (Vera Miles) is pregnant, against the law, and if he does not win the race and thus earn the right to have a child, the baby will be frozen and his wife punished. During his desperate race to cross the city he must wear protective gear to go into the Hudson River that is so toxic it will kill him if he is not so protected. He has to do it so he can get to the sewer system to go under the city instead of trying to climb the tall buildings. To get to the river he must go through an 'auto graveyard'. There are no longer cars and trucks in this city, and all the abandoned ones are parked with the sides almost touching, as they would be in a crowded valet parking lot, covering acres and acres of space. There are rebellious homeless people who live in these cars in a desperate and wild state. He is befriended by one manic soul who lights a precious hand rolled black market cigarette in front of him....something he has never seen before, and only heard of as if it were a legend of something awful. He runs from the car as the car dweller cackles manically. Other adventures include an encounter with a gangster (Cesar Romero) who has a daughter (Connie Stevens), who kind of falls for the hero and helps him by getting some needed equipment to continue his journey, and warns him that the criminal element are seeking to kill him to prevent him from interfering with their winning the race. In the end the hero does win, and the final scene shows him and his now obviously pregnant wife inside, and clinging to, a high chain link fence, with trees and grass behind them (there has been no other vegetation shown in this movie) listening to the shouted curses of the masses outside as they are held back by military police. The hero's final words are those of a hope they can start a new beginning for humankind in their little Eden, but the surrounding chaos implies that it is just too late."

(Credits start rolling.)Maki is sent to prison, and in the same bus goes a beautiful and happy first-time offender, Natsuko Kimura (Chiyoko Kazama), condemned to 26 months for robbing a motorcycle and injuring a cop in a motorcycle chase (flashback). Two other girls tell their stories (all in flashback): Yukie Nakagawa (Masami Sôda), the pickpocket, tells hers at the sewing mill; Kaoru Ashida (Yumiko Katayama), tells in the recreation yard how she got three years in prison for rape, extortion, and assault... of a john who didn't pay after he had sex with her.Everything serves the young women to make merry, but not so Masayo Tani (Miki Sugimoto), a gangster's moll, who keeps to herself, apart from the others in the recreation yard. (A flashback shows how she was attacked by men at a gambling parlor, when they deemed she had cheated; they stripped her, exposing the large tattoo of a dragon covering her back and buttocks.) Masayo's eyes cross the the opposite end of the yard, and she stares at the other lonely inmate, Maki. In the evening, when the girls play dice in a communal cell, Maki's silence gets on the others' nerves. Masayo interferes, and tries to impose her leadership, but Maki won't answer even her - who deems this an untenable lack of respect.In the morning, a duel is arranged in the recreation yard. Inmates not being provided with knives, the two young women face up with long shards of glass in their right hands, and a three yard tether made up of pieces of cloth knotted together, held between their teeth. The piece of rope allowed some distance between them, but not much. The first to scream after a cut, loses the fight. Mika and Masayo are encircled by the prison populace who watch with glee as the two slashed at each other, in silence. Maki is wounded twice, both girls cut each others' arms, but keep holding their grips on the cloth tether with their left hands. Maki breaks her improvised blade. Next, she is cut across the chest, ripping open her prison tunic, and then she loses the small shard she still had, and is cut across the left cheek. Yet, neither cried, nor flinched. Masayo drops her weapon, and lifts up her fists, in a mute invitation to change the weapons. There is a break forced by the guards passing with a group of other detainees, during which the fighters are shielded from the guards by a line of their comrades.The fighting pair punch and knee each other for a while, then grapple and roll on the ground, until they trample - twice - over a box of white powder [possibly quicklime] that subsequently spreads on the ground, and the girls' bodies, impairing their sight. Yet, they grapple and punch each other in a frenzy. Maki, her eyes closed, keeps punching off target, and falling, and tripping, and falling, and Masayo limits herself to throw Maki down again. A couple of girls tell Maki that she lost, and try to grab her, but she waves her arms around to shove them away, and using the tether for guidance, stubbornly gets back at Masayo. Maki's clothes have been torn so that both her breasts are exposed, and now she clinches with Masayo, and slaps her a couple of times. Maki is so tired that she falls onto her back without moving, and Masayo stops fighting, and looks down at Maki in awe. When, against all odds, Maki stands up after a minute of swoon, her teeth still gripped on her end of the cloth, coming at Masayo for another blind clinch, Masayo lets fall her point of the tether, and says, «You won.» Masayo walks away, Maki delivers two punches in the air, and collapses again, totally spent.Maki won the respect of every inmate for not giving up, and soon after, she tells them (in flashbacks) what was behind her silence. Maki saw her father's body being recovered from a river by the police, knowing that he had been forced by the yakuza into dealing in drugs; he became a drunkard, and a useless father, but he was her only family; and then she was raped by that gang, too. The other girls reproach her for having tried to avenge her father alone, and wonder why she didn't tell the full story to the police. Maki keeps silent again.
Masayo asks, ""Which yakuza group killed your father?""
""Oba Industries.""
""Oba?""
""What? Do you know them?""
""No..."" Yet, Masayo's expression betrays her, and Maki was staring at her.A few years later, Maki leaves prison, and her three best friends - Kaoru, Natsuko, and Yukie - are waiting for her. Maki gives them the cold shoulder, but ends up accepting their company. She tells them that she has a plan, not only to kill Oba, but to destroy him first. She sends Yukie and Natsuko to find out everything they can about the Oba Industries, and charges Kaoru with finding a safe place for them to hide.
Maki tells them that they'll meet again in a couple of weeks - while she flies to some island with a U.S. Military Base [Okinawa, not mentioned in dialogue], and makes big money by prostituting herself to American army officers, until she has enough money to buy a box with machine-guns and hand grenades, ""lost"" in the Army inventory.Kaoru is afraid of dealing with these weapons. Maki tells her that the Hamayasu clan owned that town until ten years ago, when all businesses were forcibly taken over by Oba and his gang. The Hamayasu clan reacted, and had several clashes with the Oba gang, until they were defeated in a big battle - shortly after Maki had been arrested. Yukie tells of her findings: an assemblyman named Kamejiro Tanno (Hôsei Komatsu), had imposed a truce, just before the Hamayasu gang had been wiped out. The Oba gang has the monopoly of drugs. Yukie points at photographs: Sugai (Seiya Satô), Hayami (Shinzô Hotta), Yabuki (Keiichi Kitagawa), and Ogata (Tooru Hanada). Maki wonders why the Oba gang did not finish with the Hamayasu, but Natsuko adds that they didn't care about their aging Boss, Yasutaro Hamada (Bontarô Miake), who has problems with his only son, Tetsu Hamada's (Takeo Chii), a no-good man, who spends his time at billiards and drinking. The girls agree that a good plan is to set the Oba and the Hayamasu gangs against each other.Symbolically, Maki picks Ogata's photo from the wall, and sets it afire with her lighter. Maki catches him alone in a rainy night, and stabs him to death. The other girls take her away in a car, and leave Yukie behind to give the alert, and provide Oba's men who appear quickly, with disinformation. Meanwhile, Boss Oba is having sex with... Masayo, nude but for the unmistakable tattoo on her body. He is interrupted by a henchman, who delivers the news of Ogata's death, and brings Yukie in, who plays her character of unwilling witness to the hilt. The men are convinced that Ogata had been killed by two or three men using a car, and leaves... after pick-pocketing the wallet of a henchman. However, she had been seen by Masayo...The two gang bosses meet, and Yasutaro Hamada promises to investigate if the murder had been commanded by his son. Oba and his men leave in two cars, only to have the road blocked by a construction truck. On top of the truck's cabin, laughing out loud, is Tetsu, who has two men with him. They throw a few large cans of gasoline on the road, and he lights them with two pistol shots. Oba is humiliated, and gives orders to kill Tetsuo. The four girls join him before he goes to see his father. They bring the box with guns, and ask for five million yen. And the girls came armed, to be on the safety side.Meanwhile, the Assemblyman presents the excuses for the gasoline incident to Oba, plus the promise of a profitable contract relating to an urban development project. That convinces Oba to accept a truce.Masayo interrupts a meeting of the four ex-con girls, in their secret place. To Maki's amazement, she came just to give advice: ""Maki, don't ask any questions. Just get out of town."" And at the insistent question, why, she reveals: ""Because I'm Oba's woman."" Before leaving, she stares Maki eye-to-eye, neither flinches, and it's clear that Maki is still bent on revenge, and Masayo is going to be loyal to her owner [sic] and protector, Oba.The girls have prepared an ambush, and Maki shoots Assemblyman Tanno, using a rifle with telescopic lenses. His bodyguards in the car are powerless, and never saw the women on top of a near-by building. Oba misinterprets this killing as the end of the truce that was in Tanno's hands, and sends a number of his men to attack and destroy the rival's headquarters. A gun fight takes place between the two clans. The attackers win. The old Boss dies, with his samurai sword in hand, and Tetsu is taken away through a back door by a handful of his men, who survived the massacre.Oba is pleased with a ""job well done"". Tetsu is eager to buy more ""pineapples"" from Maki...The girls lure a number of Oba's henchmen with their bodies, and dispose of them.Maki is not successful with her prey, though. While she is in the shower, he suspects her, and takes her prisoner to Oba's headquarters, where she is put in bonds, slapped, and menaced with an electric see-saw being used on a female card mannequin. With the cutting blade inches from her face, still Maki is not talking. Masayo intervenes, and uses her lighted cigarette on Maki's nipples. Maki screams many times, one for each burning pain on her bosom, while Oba watches. Then, she passes a knife into Maki's hands - tied behind her back - slaps her some more, and Oba decides to put an end to it.During the night, Oba's bodyguard who had captured Maki visits her in the basement, and cuts her ropes, intent to rape her. Maki forces him at knife point to tell her where and when the drugs for money exchange will take place, and then kills him. On the man's wristwatch, she sees how many hours she has to prepare her next move.Her three friends attack Oba's men at the dockyard, and mow down a number of them, before escaping with the suitcase with the drugs. Oba learns that a man found dead at the dockyard is Miyamoto (Hirohisa Nakata), an underling chief of the Hamayasu gang, thus he is more convinced that the attack it's Tetsu's doing.Maki appears, her wounds tended to, and hidden by a design dress, wearing platform sandals, telling him that indeed, she is working with Tetsu, her ""business partner"". She tells him that she sold the drugs to Tetsu, but she came to Oba because she wants more money - his money. Masayo is present, and the only one who's wise to Maki's plan, but she keeps quiet. Maki demands 30 million yen for the information about where Tetsu and the drugs - worth 300 million - are. Oba is undecided, but Masayo tells him that she thinks the girl is not lying and, ""If she is, I'll take care of her."" Upstairs, in the office, Maki places the three stacks of banknotes into her large suitcase, and says, ""You'll find Tetsu in the abandoned ship at the 13th reclaimed yard.""Oba and his men drive to the indicated place in four cars, and well armed. A first team rushes into the rusty ship, only to find it is empty. Tetsu comes out of a hiding place with his men, from where they dominate the barren land of the abandoned dockyard, and they start throwing grenades at Oba's men. Several go up in explosions. Then, Oba's men hide the best they can, and start shooting back. More men die in the gun fight. Tetsu dies in Oba's hands, but his last words prove that he knows nothing about Oba's drugs...Maki re-appears, in a new light beige jacket and trousers ensemble, and the suitcase with the drugs. Maki's three protecting angels appear with guns to shoot down the last of Oba's bodyguards, including Yabuki (Keiichi Kitagawa), whose specialty is spitting darts held in chewing gum. Oba is alone, and Maki tells her of her personal grievances against him. She pulls a gun, and shoots at him - six times, each bullet into one of his limbs, and the last two in each side of his forehead.Masayo steps towards Maki, ""This is not over yet"".
Maki counters, ""I knew you'd come.""
Masayo shows anger: ""How dare you make a complete fool of me?"" Masayo says she wants the money, as she had been with Oba just for it, the money. Maki refuses.Masayo had come prepared for this final set-to, with two flick-blades. She throws one at Maki, and opens hers. Maki sets the suitcase down, and opens hers, too. The knife fight starts, and Maki warns her three friends to stay out of it. Maki wounds Masayo's in the right wrist, and she has to drop the knife. Maki - replicating what Masayo had done in their first duel - drops her own knife, and strips her jacket. The two women continue their fight by punching, wrestling, kicking, pulling hair and delivering knee blows. At one point, Masayo falls close to the suitcase, and throws it at Maki's face. The suitcase falls open, revealing a number of sachets, some of which are ripped, and their white powder, drugs, set to waste by the breeze.[continuity error, betraying a cut scene: Masayo reappears with no jacket] The two fighting women are stumbling onto the sea-shore, and keep trading punches. They return to land, and exchange a couple of punches more, until both drop alongside each other, face up, on the white covered land - duplicating the end of their first duel. Both are breathing hard, exhausted, under the brilliant sun.Masayo concedes, ""You've become a truly ruthless woman. How dare you surpass me? You're like a viper.""
Maki recognizes, ""So then, you're still a rattlesnake? I don't think so. I know you're not easily beaten.""
They turn their faces toward each other, and they look deeply into each other's eyes.Yukie: ""Cut it out, you two. You've ruined a fortune's worth of dope... Speaking of ruthless women, every woman here is as ruthless as the devil.""
Kaoru: ""Five women like us together could take on the whole world.""
Natsuko: ""There are plenty of thugs left.""
Yukie: ""That's right!""
Natsuko: ""We'll chew 'em up, and spit'em out.""The three girls walk away with, carrying their weapons. Maki and Masayo stand up with some difficulty, and follow them. [theme song until The End]"
