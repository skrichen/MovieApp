tt0042184,"['Comedy', 'Romance']","Synopsis Has been Written by Mr Rais Asghar, My Uncle, on 20 August 2018 (Rashid Ashraf)AFSAR-1950Though not a blast from the past, the golden era of Indian cinema, film ""AFSAR"" of 1950, starring Dev Anand, Suriya with Kanhaiya Lal, Zohra Sehgal etc. Director Chetan Anand, Producer Dev Anand, though a really enjoyable classical comedy deep-set in a historical reality, seems to have been lost from the memory of even really old film lovers just as it has actually been lost from prints as neither DVD or Internet is available anywhere in Pakistan or even in India.The story is skillfully set in the last era of British rule when after several historical land reforms in the subcontinent, the government faced the gigantic problem of assessing the actual incomes of landlords to net them in for state revenues. For purpose of direct assessments revenue officers were deputed, while for a larger number of indirect assessments, persons were sent and dispersed to villages in disguise of varying professions and for longer periods to secretly make their own assessment of on the spot realities and of actual sources and incomes.Dev Anand a smart but long unemployed city youth unaware of the fact that persons have been secretly deputed in disguise to villages, goes along with an illiterate quirky assistant and with no equipment, bare straw furniture and with not even the barest of medical knowledge goes to a village and sets up a dispensary as a last attempt at livelihood.Soon the ludicrous village simpletons of various sizes and shapes with rustic attires, accents and ways, a real entertainment to watch in the film, finding Dev Anand far removed from their lot, start spying on his activities, peeping in the dispensary through its falling windows and holes, and begin to spin up tales of him being of the disguised agents rumored to have been sent to asses incomes and their sources, and cook up their stories so convincingly that the owner of the entire village, the landlord, already under fear of losing some of his income and even property to the state, believes his men and their tales.He invites Dev Anand to his impressive haveli, gives him a reception and respect and starts discussions on some medical issues. However the unconvincing, na√Øve and evasive replies of Dev Anand on medicine further leads the landlord to believe that he is really the agent sent by the state to rope him and his vast income. He offers Dev Anand to stay at his haveli and Dev by now having realized what his is being mistaken for, starts skillfully playing the role of his mistaken identity or rather misperceived identity. The landlord introduces Dev Anand made purposely as a permanent guest to his daughter who is learning dancing and music, and she entertains Dev Anand with some classical songs and dances which are a part of the film.Without much time and effort while staying at the haveli Dev Anand seduces her by his charms into a relationship without thinking of the consequences.The landlord had been advised by his men that whatever reports Dev Anand sends to his superiors in the city will necessarily go through the village post office where by design it can be checked and brought back to the landlord to have him see its contents.Call it misfortune or climax to come Dev Anand sends a letter to a friend in his city, narrating to him how he is enjoying in the village due to a mistaken identity. He also comments on each, the landlord his daughter and village folk, and their idiosyncrasies in the most humorous and somewhere disparaging words. This letter by scheme lands back in the hands of the landlord and read in a village gathering.Dev Anand is also informed by some one of the letter falling into the villagers hands, and he plans to escape. However he confides to the landlords daughter that he is not the one they all are thinking to be, but is just an unemployed miserable young man, who had come to set up a dispensary in the village. The heroine says she accepts he as he is and will always be his companion, and both plan to run away from the village and make for the small railway station.In the meantime the villagers, who had read the letter exposing Dev Anand, and his sarcastic comments about all in the village, and knowing that he has fled with the landlord's daughter, run towards the railway station. While they are after him, chasing the pair ferociously, Dev and his eloping lady miss the train by a few minutes. What happens can be well imagined, but the end is not within the memory of this writer.Any person who can get a print of the movie or knows from where it can be got both in India and Pakistan, are requested with thanks to respond."

Looking on from the audience are many other famous thespians and figures of the theater: the well known director Bill Simpson (Gary Merrill), the successful playwright Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe) and his wife Karen (Celeste Holm), and one of the brightest stars of Broadway, the incomparable Margo Channing (Bette Davis). All look upon Miss Harrington with a mixture of distaste and disgust on their faces, while off to the side sits the well known and often reviled theater critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders), who, with a bemused look on his face, begins to recount Eve's recent past. He, better than anyone else, knows all about Eve.Not so long ago, Eve was just a star-struck young woman, waiting outside the stage door night after night, hoping to catch a glimpse of her idol Margo Channing. Finally noticed and brought in by Margo's friend Karen, Eve gushes her unworthiness and gratitude, and manages to ingratiate herself quickly into Margo's life as a general assistant. She also impresses Margo's long-time mate Bill as a helpful and guileless girl who wants nothing more than to be of use. Before long, Eve is living in Margo's home, answering telephones and bringing her breakfast in bed. Birdie, Margo's maid (Thema Ritter) begins to dislike Eve, and tells Margo that it's unnerving the way Eve studies her every move. She can sense trouble brewing.Thus alerted to Eve's behavior, Margo become's suspicious, and while all around assure her that Eve is an innocent kid just trying to help, she begins to see plots and schemes everywhere. Holding a party for Bill's birthday, Margo gets a little too drunk and angrily abuses everyone. Confiding in Karen after Margo's stinging accusations, Eve asks a favor: could Karen possibly put in a good word for her with her playwright husband? She's consider it the greatest thing in her life if she could serve as Margo's unworthy understudy the new play he's writing.Karen gladly assents, and all too soon Eve gets her chance to show her own abilities. Margo is famous for being late, and at an ordinary read-through which she fails to attend, Eve upstages Margo badly, astonishing the critic DeWitt with her wonderful abilities. Suddenly there's a new kid in town, and under her very nose Eve is stealing all of Margo's attention. Stunned by Eve, Margo has an angry confrontation with Bill, who decides it's time he said goodbye. Karen and Lloyd have also become fed up with Margo's attitude towards Eve, and Karen decides to teach her old friend a lesson. A suspiciously empty gas tank prevents Margo from returning from a weekend getaway in time for that night's performance, and Eve takes the stage. The performance is very good, and Addison DeWitt begins to take more than a passing interest in the career of Miss Harrington. Waiting outside her dressing room, he overhears Eve as she tries to seduce Bill away from Margo. Bill refuses her advances, and DeWitt steps in to the opportunity.His review in the paper lauds Eve and quotes her as saying some rather nasty things about Margo Channing. Shaken into the realization that Margo has been justly suspicious of Eve all along, Bill returns and Lloyd and Karen rally around their old friend. Bill even proposes marriage to Margo, and they all celebrate over dinner, but a note arrives for Karen during the meal. Eve is waiting in the ladies room, begging Karen to listen to what she has to say. Curious but armed with complete distrust, she finds Eve lamenting this terrible turn of events. DeWitt has twisted her words she claims, and the last thing in the world Eve wanted was to hurt her idol Margo.For a moment, Karen believes Eve is sincere, and reassures her that Margo will recover. Rising to leave, Eve asks another favor. She wants Karen to make sure the lead in her husband's next play is given to her. Eve is suddenly hard and cold, and Karen, confused, refuses at first. Eve however has a nasty threat to hold over Karen. She'll reveal to DeWitt just who it was that arranged that empty gas tank, and kept Margo out of the city. Stunned, Karen must assent, and returns to the table not knowing just what to do. Margo announces she's decided not to be in that new play Lloyd's writing anyway, and Karen is forced to laugh at the bizarre turn of events while the others wonder just what is so funny.Soon Eve is on stage as the lead in Lloyd's play, with Bill reluctantly directing. Everyone is fighting backstage, but Eve reveals herself as a master at manipulation, coddling and soothing everyone to keep them working together, all the while driving wedges into their relationships. She also begins to work on stealing Lloyd away from Karen, and by the time they are ready to open off Broadway, Eve has set the stage for her greatest triumph. Addison DeWitt has followed events closely and has become Eve's closest adviser, attending the rehearsals. Walking her back to the hotel in the afternoon before opening night, he implements a plan of his own. Telling Eve that he will be taking control of her career, she becomes angry with him and tells him to get out. She announces that Lloyd is leaving Karen for her, and once she has him under her control, there will be no limit to what she can achieve.DeWitt has other plans. He has had a long talk with Lloyd's wife Karen, and he know much more than Eve thinks. He also knows that Eve herself is nothing what she seems; she has lied about her past, her name, everything in fact, and he now has the power to wreck her career before it really starts. Also, Lloyd is not leaving his wife for her. Eve will now do as he says.""You're an improbable person, Eve,"" he says, ""but so am I. We have that in common. Also a contempt for humanity, an inability to love or be loved, insatiable ambition - and talent. We deserve each other."" Finding her own manipulations turned against her, Eve is forced to accept DeWitt's terms. She collapses on the bed in tears.And so we return to the prestigious ceremony where the wonderful Eve Harrington is accepting an award from a room full of her peers. Cold and calculating, she has achieved all her ambitions at the cost of all trust or friendship. Margo Channing will go on being Margo Channing, and Eve will be left to her own bitterness at being under Addison DeWitt's control. Returning to her empty hotel room, she pours a drink, and is startled to see a young woman sleeping in a chair behind her.""Who are you?"" demands Eve angrily. The young woman is Phoebe, a high-school girl who admires her immensely. The doorbell rings, and Eve, too tired to answer it, accepts Phoebe's offer of help. At the door is DeWitt, returning with Eve's forgotten award. In a glance, he takes in Phoebe and all her shallow ambition, and as he leaves he smiles sardonically, knowing that the cycle is beginning all over again."

tt0042249,"['Drama', 'War']","THE BIG LIFTThe Soviet Union withdraws from what was the Allied government of Berlin, and subsequently blocks off roads and railways into the city, so that the areas controlled by the US, Britain, and France can get supplies only by flights into Tempelhof Airport. At various air bases throughout the world, USAir Force planes and crews are directed to fly to the Frankfurt/Main US air base to help supply West Berlin with food, coal, and other necessities. The film concentrates on two American sergeants who know each other, Danny McCullough (Montgomery Clift), and Hank Kowalski (Paul Douglas) as they fly in from Honolulu.Hank, Danny and others in their group arrive in Frankfurt/Main air base and are assigned temporary quarters there, and soon begin to shuttle from Frankfurt into Berlin. The procedures in the cockpit and the landing descents into runways in the heart of a built up city are shown in some detail. Danny is in charge of cockpit checklists for the pilots who are flying. Hanks job is related to radar control of the approaches to land. Some sequences explain how the approach control works.For several months, they are confined to the airport while in Berlin. When Danny and others in the crew arrive in Berlin in what is flight number 100,000 of the airlift, the German authorities in the city welcome them in a special surprise ceremony that involves an extensive honor guard parade, and souvenir gifts presented by a municipal leader, a young boy, and comely war widow Frederika Burkhardt (Cornell Borchers). A newsman covering the event encourages Frederika and Danny to kiss after the presentation, to get good pictures for his story.Danny is much taken with Frederika, and after a brief chat gets an address for her and the phone number or a neighbor, where he might reach her if he ever gets permission to visit the city.Motivated by his attraction for Frederika, Danny makes arrangements for public relations activities with the newsman as a way of getting blocks of time to spend in Berlin outside the airport. Meantime, Hank has been assigned ground work at Tempelhof.The first time Danny gets time in Berlin outside Tempelhof, the camera follows him as he tries to find Frederika, and this gives an excuse for showing scenes of streets and avenues demolished by the war, of people surviving as best they can, and some of the black market activity.Danny finds Frederika gathering up rubble to recycle bricks with a crew of women working under a male foreman. He can only talk with her briefly to make a date for later. Later, Danny gives out cigarettes, and paint spills on his uniform. Federica takes his clothes to a cleaner, he takes a bath and borrows clothes from the neighbor..The neighbor with a phone is Stieber (O. E. Hasse). He has a phone because he is a spy for the Soviets, who is assigned the task of counting and identifying the airplanes that land at Tempelhof, since the apartment has a window overlooking the approach path. Stieber explains that he documents the flights for the Soviets, who do not trust the official information given in the newspapers. Since the official information is correct, he purposefully miscounts the planes downward in his reports so the Soviets keep him at his job.
The cleaning shop closes early, as the owner has a family emergency that takes him to the Soviet sector. Frederika and Danny take a subway to find the owner and retrieve a key. On the ride, they cross into the Soviet sector and there is an inspection for contraband. A man carrying dozens of coffee bags under his coat manages to divert the attention of the inspectors by denouncing a fellow passenger for having ONE coffee bag under her hat. After failing to retrieve the uniform, they meet Hank and Gerda (Bruni Lobel) in a restaurant with live entertainment. Hank orders Gerda around, answers for her, while giving his opinion that Germans are too submissive to fathers, and that prepared their psychology to follow Hitler. Danny points out that Hank is treating Gerda just like that. Hank argues back but changes his attitude toward Gerda. He tries to explain democracy to her.Hank does not hide his anti German attitudes. He demands that Frederika give an account of her background, and she claims that her husband had disappeared after being arrested by the SS, and that her father had been a somewhat outspoken anti Nazi.While at the restaurant, police come in checking identity papers. Danny doesnt have any, but manages to escape the check by pretending to be one of the entertainment jazz trio, which with him becomes a quartet.At the restaurant, Hank sees a man at another table and he seems familiar. As the man leaves, he thinks he recognizes him because he has a limp, and follows him out. After following him for some distance through areas deserted because of war damage, he calls him Felix. The man pretends not to speak English but Hank is sure he was the guard that tormented and beat Hank while he was a war prisoner, and exacts revenge by turnabout. Danny, Gerda and Frederika catch up with Hank and try to stop the beating. As Military Police arrive, and Danny runs with Frederika into the Soviet sector by crossing the Brandenburg gate. At the Soviet check point Frederika claims that Danny is her husband. At first they are believed, and they walk on, but other Soviet sector guards catch up and try to arrest them. A crowd gathers, guards from the British and French sectors intervene, the location of the borders is disputed, and in the confusion Frederika and Danny get away.In the apartment Danny wakes after 3 in the morning. Frederika has electricity from 3 to 5 AM and is ironing his uniform. In their chat, she realizes that Danny loves her.Danny successfully returns to duty even though his uniform has shrunk. Some time later Hank shows Danny documents showing that Frederika has lied, that her husband had volunteered early into the SS. Frederika admits she lied, but she explains their dire needs to survive, to make him sympathetic. At first, Danny decides to end the relationship, realizing that Frederika is capable of deceit. As he walks away in a street of ruined houses, a section of wall falls down. However, he returns some time later.As he arrives back to the Frankfurt base, a group of sailors from the Navy are also arriving to help in the airlift. A comical sequence follows in which the Army guys sing the Navy song and vice versa, in good natured rivalry ribbing.At the base, Danny asks permission to marry a German citizen, and his commanding officer explains the rules and regulations and time frames. Because of the success of the air lift at that point, replacements are coming in, there is a good chance that Danny would be sent back soon, so there is time schedule pressure on his marriage arrangements.In a comic relief sequence, Hank tries to explain America and its values to Gerda, how people of different nationalities live in New York City peacefully, and how Americans are not persecuted or put in prison for expressing criticism of their government.We see how the neighbor Stieber has become suspicious because Frederika receives letters mailed from the USA, and opens them first, even though letters from Danny have arrived simultaneously.Eventually Danny learns he scheduled to leave on the next Friday. Danny talks with Frederika through a fence of the airport compound, and they make arrangements to hurry the paperwork so they can marry before his departure back to the USA.Complications arise because of weather, as fog forces cancellation of flights. Danny gets on a plane that departs in a short moment of less fog, but then has a burning engine that triggers an emergency landing. This gives an excuse for a sequence that shows how radar radar is used for foggy landings, as Hank and gives the plane landing instructions by radio. They land safely.Eventually after much frantic running around, Danny finds Frederika in Berlin and makes the appointment to marry. Hank and Gerda are to be the witnesses. At the last minute, Gerda argues with Hank about her rights and throws him out of her apartment, but he changes tone and attitude and she relents. Meantime, Frederika asks an emergency favor from Stieber, to mail an important letter. Stieber, suspicious, opens it and reads how she plans to meet another man, a man she loves, in America. As Hank and Gerda wait at the office where the marriage would take place, Danny arrives first, and then after Frederika show up, Danny comments that maybe she would like to go to St. Louis instead of St. Paul. He has the incriminating letter and lets Hank read it. Danny walks away. Gerda follows him and says she has decided to stay in Germany to help make it better. Hank informs Danny that he has been reassigned to permanent duty, and he now speaks fluent German. They say goodbye.An airplane departs in the partially cleared fog. A last image shows a bunch of crows walking on the ground. This is a reference to an earlier comment by Hank, that the US Air Force flies even when birds stay on the ground."

A few weeks later, Christabel is having dinner with Nick, who has been pursuing her. Christabel tells him that she was raised by a poor aunt, and Nick observes that she is 'two people.'

At the ball, Christabel runs into Nick, who is promoting his new book. Going alone into a courtyard, Christabel reveals that she is unhappy and confused, and that she misses Nick and wants to see him again.

tt0042286,"['Drama', 'Romance', 'Western']","Indian scout Tom Jeffords (James Stewart) is sent out to stem the war between the Whites and Apaches in the late 1870s. He learns (through an uncomfortably close encounter) that the Indians kill only to protect themselves, or out of retaliation for white atrocities. Befriending the sagacious Apache leader Cochise (Jeff Chandler), Jeffords ensures safe passage for white mail-carriers through Indian territory. As he becomes closer to his Native American ""brothers"", Jeffords falls in love with and weds a pretty Apache girl (Debra Paget). This being a 1950 film (miscegenation was frowned upon by the Production Code), you can guess what happens to her. Jeffords wants to avenge his bride's death at the hands of white renegades, but it is the so-called ""savage"" Cochise who advises him not to. Having learned much from each other, Jeffords and Cochise symbolize the white/Indian detente with the traditional broken arrow. This superb, non-condescending film has been criticized in some circles because of the alleged depiction of Cochise as an Indian ""Uncle Tom"", and because actor Jeff Chandler was not a genuine Native American. Nonetheless, Broken Arrow stands the test of time far more successfully than the later, politically correct Dances with Wolves. In 1956, Broken Arrow was adapted into a TV series starring John Lupton as Jeffords and Michael Ansara as Cochise."

The King is tired of his son always being off and away from the Kingdom, and intends to find some way to get his son to marry, and provide Grandchildren for his father. The Grand Duke tries to tell the King he should not rush his son into such a thing, but the King proposes a rather devious scheme: with his son coming home that evening, he wishes a Grand Ball to be held that evening, inviting all the eligible maidens of the Kingdom, certain that his son is bound to show interesting in one of them.Later on that day, a royal messenger shows up at the chateau with an invitation. Cinderella delivers it to her Stepfamily, and upon hearing the proclamation, grows happy that she can also attend, given that it invites ""every eligible maiden."" However, her Stepmother says she can go, ""if"" she can complete all her chores, and ""if"" she can find something suitable to wear.Cinderella quickly returns to her room, and finds an old dress that was once her Mother's. As she looks in a sewing book on ways to improve it, she is called away by her Stepfamily. Jacques then tells the other mice that he's sure Cinderella's Stepfamily is going to work her so hard, she'll never be able to complete the alterations to her dress. It is then that one of the female mice claims that they will make the alterations for Cinderella as a surprise!Jacques and Gus rush off to get some extra trimming for the dress, and encounter the Stepsisters and Stepmother ordering Cinderella around with extra chores. As she leaves them, the sisters angrily claim that they do not have any good things to wear, and angrily throw down a pink sash, and some blue beads. Jacques and Gus quickly gather them up to use for Cinderella's dress, but are menaced by Lucifer. Luckily, they manage to get away.As the hour draws late, the carriage to the ball arrives. However, having completed her chores, but not having been able to work on her dress, she returns to her room, claiming she isn't going. However, upon arriving, she is surprised by the mice and birds, as they reveal the alterations to her dress!Quickly putting it on, she rushes downstairs, and happily prepares to go to the ball. The Stepsisters are at first incensed, but their mother quickly tells them that she did make a deal with Cinderella. However, she then takes note of the blue beads on her dress, which sets the sisters off, who chastise Cinderella for taking their things, and proceed to destroy the dress.After the Stepmother ushers her daughters out the door, Cinderella rushes out of the chateau and into the garden, crying on a bench, that no matter how hard she tries to believe, things will never get better for her. However, she suddenly hears a voice, and encounters an cheerful woman in a light-blue cloak. The woman claims she is her Fairy Godmother, and intends to help Cinderella go to the ball.Using her magic wand, the Godmother turns a pumpkin into a coach, 4 of the mice into horses, the farm's horse into a coachman, and the family dog into a footman. The final touch is fixing Cinderella's dress, which is turned into a beautiful white gown, complete with glass slippers. However, the Godmother cautions her that she all these things will only last until the final stroke of midnight, when everything will turn back to normal. Cinderella then quickly boards her coach, and is taken to the Castle.Meanwhile, the ball is in full-swing, with the Prince greeting every eligible, invited maiden in the Kingdom. Though the King and Grand Duke watch, the Prince himself is rather bored by the whole thing. However, as he officially greets the Stepsisters, he sees a girl having just entered, and goes over to her. This is immediately seen by the King, who demands a Waltz begin to play, sure that his son has found his bride. The King then retires for the evening, leaving the Grand Duke to supervise the two.The Prince then leads Cinderella out into the Palace Gardens, where they dance and wander. However, when the clock suddenly strikes midnight, Cinderella flees. The Grand Duke attempts to stop her, but she flees down the Palace's entry steps, leaving behind a glass slipper.

Suddenly, she realizes that she still has one of her glass slippers left, and looking skyward, thanks her Fairy Godmother for allowing her these few hours of happiness.Back at the Palace, the Grand Duke awakens the King regarding what has happened. At first incensed that the maiden his son danced with has gotten away, the Duke claims that his son still wants to find and marry her. With the glass slipper the only clue, the King sets the Duke on a mission to have the slipper tried on every girl in the Kingdom, setting the Duke to task before the sun rises!The next morning, Cinderella's Stepmother quickly demands she help her daughters immediately. The two Stepsisters are slow to wake up, when the Stepmother tells of the proclamation, and how the girl that was seen dancing with the Prince is being searched for. The girls boredly wonder what this has to do with them, when their mother tells of the slipper, and how all one of them has to do is fit it, to become the Prince's bride!However, the thought of marrying the Prince sidetracks Cinderella, who drops the load of laundry the Stepsisters give her, and begins to 'dance' off back to her room to get dressed. However, the Stepmother follows her up the stairs, and locks the door, with Cinderella pleading to be let out of the room!Some time afterwards, the Grand Duke arrives, and the Stepmother and her daughters greet him. Jacques and Gus manage to get the key out of the Stepmother's pocket, and make the impossible task of climbing the stairs to Cinderella's room, only to be foiled by Lucifer, who traps Gus and the key under a bowl. The mice and birdsattempt to free Gus, but Lucifer has them at bay. Cinderella then suggests they get the family dog Bruno, and several of the birds alert the dog, who manages to scare Lucifer, sending him plummeting out of a nearby window.Meanwhile, the Duke has grown exasperated as the girls have angrily and vehemently tried to get the glass slipper to fit. With the claim by the Stepmother that there are no other maidens in the house, he is about to leave when Cinderella voice is heard, requesting to try on the slipper.The Stepmother and Stepsisters attempt to keep the Duke from Cinderella, but he claims that per his orders, he has to try the slipper on ""Every Maiden.""However, as the Duke's footman brings the slipper, the Stepmother causes him to trip on her cane, sending the slipper flying to the floor, where it shatters!The Duke is beside himself, over what will happen to him, but it is then that Cinderella claims that he shouldn't worry, as she has the other slipper! She then produces it (much to the surprise of her Stepmother), and the Duke places it on her foot, where it fits perfectly!The final images of the film are of Cinderella being married to the Prince, with her mice and bird friends watching her get into a carriage, and riding off to a Happily Ever After."
tt0042367,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Romance']","In a Paris theater in 1640, a play begins before a fairly full house. After a few painfully dull lines are delivered by principal actor Montfleury (Arthur Blake), a boisterous heckler in a box disrupts the proceedings. The heckler is Cyrano de Bergerac (Jos√© Ferrer), poet and supreme swordsman, who says he cannot endure the actor's bombastic style. He gives Montfleury a slow count of three to disappear before coming at him, and the actor runs away. Eventually Cyrano confronts the playwright and theater manager, insisting that the play be closed. When the manager complains that he can't afford to refund money to the audience, Cyrano throws him a bag of gold coins.Watching from another box in the theater are Cyrano's distant cousin, the beautiful Roxane (Mala Powers), with her attendant (Virginia Farmer); the Comte de Guiche (Ralph Clanton), who is Roxane's suitor; and the Vicomte de Valvert (Albert Cavens), an arrogant aristocrat who is so annoyed he insults Cyrano with snide but clich√©d comments about his enormous nose. This can only lead to a duel.Cyrano first mocks the vicomte's lack of wit, improvising numerous inventive ways in which Valvert might have phrased references to the giant nose, much to the amusement of the audience. Cyrano then announces he will compose a poem and recite it during the duel, which he does -- thus showing off simultaneously his skills as poet and swordsman. With the last line, he stabs his opponent, and the audience leaves.Cyrano's friend Le Bret (Morris Carnovsky), captain of the Gascony guards, warns him he has made powerful enemies, but Cyrano is unconcerned.When Le Bret presses him as to why he hates Montfleury, Cyrano admits that he became jealous when he saw the actor making advances towards Roxane. He confesses that he is in love with her, but harbors no hope of being loved in return because of his deformity, his huge nose. Le Bret suggests they go out to eat, but Cyrano says he has no money left, as all he had was in the bag he threw at the theater manager -- a costly grand gesture that he does not regret.A beautiful fruit seller (Elena Verdugo) overhears Cyrano, offers him food and wine from a buffet prepared for the theater patrons, and mentions her admiration for his poetry and bravery. But he refuses charity food, accepting only a grape, a sip of water and half a macaroon. This is his way of acknowledging her regard while emphasizing his disdain for money.Le Bret points out to Cyrano that the girl's admiration indicates he has real possibilities of being loved despite his nose. He also tells him that Roxane watched his duel with an excited fascination that surely was encouraging.Roxane's servant reenters to arrange a meeting between Roxane and Cyrano the next morning after church. Cyrano, becoming bold, says he will wait at the pastry shop run by his friend Ragueneau (Lloyd Corrigan).At this point, pastry chef and fellow poet Ragueneau approaches Cyrano for help. Ragueneau has been warned that De Guiche, whom Ragueneau has mocked in published poetry, has hired a hundred ruffians to give him a beating that night, and he asks to sleep at Cyrano's. Cyrano scoffs at the threat, promising Ragueneau he will escort him safely home. The mob of ruffians appears as Cyrano walks with Ragueneau on a dark and deserted street and Cyrano alone routs them, wounding many and killing eight.The next day at the pastry shop, before he can tell Roxane of his feelings, she informs him that she has fallen in love with a handsome guardsman, Christian de Neuvillette (William Prince). She has never even spoken to Christian, but wants Cyrano to protect him. Cyrano hides his devastation and promises to help.At a gathering of the regiment, rookie recruit Christian de Neuvillette is being made fun of by the others. Christian asks the captain how he can establish himself, and the captain answers he must not accept mocking and must somehow demonstrate his valor. Christian is also advised never to mention the word nose or anything related to noses when Cyrano is present, or face the consequences. Moments later, Cyrano arrives to tell about his routing of the hundred ruffians hired to beat up Ragueneau. Christian, from the sidelines, interrupts the telling by adding the word nose whenever he can work it into the story, as in ""It was so dark you couldn't see . . . BEYOND YOUR NOSE.""At the first such interruption, Cyrano stops and menacingly asks who that new face might be, and he is told the young man's name is Christian de Neuvillette. Cyrano reins in his increasing anger through repeated interruptions, finally ordering everyone in the regiment out while he talks to Christian.Cyrano reveals that he knows that Christian is in love with Roxane, that he is Roxane's cousin, and that he talks to her often, whereupon Christian profusely apologizes for his recent insults. Cyrano decides to help in Christian's wooing of Roxane after Christian admits that while he is not shy or tongue-tied when talking to men, he becomes hopelessly inept when he tries to talk to Roxane. Cyrano knows words of love and starts to coach Christian systematically.Meantime, De Guiche consults his uncle, Cardinal Richelieu (Edgar Barrier), as to how to punish Cyrano for duels and fighting, which had been forbidden by Richelieu. The cardinal tells him that when a man is as talented as Cyrano with both words and sword, exceptions should be made so his talents can serve the state. De Guiche accepts the advice.Cyrano composes love letters to Roxane, which are sent and read as though they were from Christian. She finds them irresistible. Christian talks to Roxane using memorized and practiced phrases supplied by Cyrano, and she falls ever more deeply in love. Cyrano continues his own visits to Roxane, during which they talk mostly about her love for Christian. De Guiche, meantime, has not given up his suit for Roxane's hand, and is much annoyed at meeting Cyrano at Roxane's, although he follows Richelieu's advice and makes no trouble.Later, Christian decides he wants no more help and tries to speak to Roxane on his own, in her garden. Roxane rebuffs him in short order and reenters her house. Cyrano, who had been watching from behind some bushes, comes to his rescue, whispering words to him that Christian speaks loudly to her from beneath her window. When she admires his newly found words but is puzzled by how hesitantly he speaks, Cyrano takes over completely, able to pull off the deceit because of the darkness and because he is beneath the balcony. At the point that Roxane is totally won over by Cyrano's eloquence, a friar (Francis Pierlot) arrives bearing a letter from De Guiche for Roxane. De Guiche insists on marrying her that night, as his regiment is ordered to join the siege at Arras and must leave the next morning. He will be arriving soon after the friar.Roxane reads the sealed letter aloud but changes its content, telling the friar he is sent to immediately perform a rite marrying her to Christian, and as this is somewhat irregular, one hundred and twenty gold coins will be given to his monastery.Cyrano stays in the garden to delay De Guiche until the marriage ceremony is over. Cyrano intercepts de Guiche as he arrives and pretends, in a long conversation with detailed technical explanations, that he has just fallen from the moon. Furious at finding Roxane married, De Guiche, who is Christian's commander, orders him to join his unit immediately for the siege against the Spanish armies. Roxane begs Cyrano to get Christian to write her a letter every day, and he promises.The siege becomes complicated, as the besieging French are in turn encircled by Spaniards. It is Cyrano who writes letters to the fair Roxane, but in Christian's name. De Guiche's heroism in battle wins the admiration of Cyrano, who had previously despised him, so the enmity between these two evolves into respect. To send the letters every day, Cyrano must risk his life to cross the no-man's-land between the opposing armies.Learning that a convoy will carry food and supplies through the battle zone to the besieged French forces, Roxane in disguise stows away on a wagon and thus arrives to visit her husband in the camp. They embrace joyfully, and she thanks him profusely for the daily letters that she has received from him, telling him that she is now more than ever in love with the great soul she knows from the words he writes.Christian did not know about the letters, so he realizes she has fallen in love with Cyrano's words. He pretends to be concerned about what might happen if he were to become seriously wounded in the upcoming battle -- crippled, perhaps; disfigured, maybe. What if he were to become ugly? She radiantly proclaims none of that would make any difference.Christian leaves Roxane for a moment and goes to talk with Cyrano, reporting Roxane's proclamations of love despite ugliness or physical disfigurement. He gets his rival to promise to tell Roxane the truth about the words and letters, and let her decide between them.Before the opportunity arises, an attack begins, a major battle ensues, Christian volunteers for a dangerous mission and is brought back fatally wounded. Cyrano deceives Roxane, so Roxane tells Christian that she knows everything, and as he dies in her arms, Christian thinks he is the chosen one. Roxane finds a last unsent letter in his pocket and decides to carry it forever in a locket near her heart.Fourteen years pass. Roxane has entered a life of seclusion in a convent. Cyrano visits her once a week, at three o'clock on Saturdays, telling her news about the world outside and the gossip of the court, but never mentioning his feelings. De Guiche, who has also continued to visit her, has overheard a courtier plotting against Cyrano because he has continued to write satirical articles mocking the nobility. He warns Roxane that Cyrano's life may be in danger.One night, Cyrano is lured into an ambush and run down by a speeding wagon. Near death, acting against the doctor's orders, he hides his injuries and goes the next afternoon to keep his weekly appointment with Roxane.As he is received into the courtyard, he banters with Sister Marthe (Virginia Christine). When he gives her permission to pray for him, she says she did not wait for his permission.He is injured and weak, stumbling a bit, but he refuses all help, and just sits to visit, first making a few jokes about trivial events at court. He asks Roxane to let him read Christian's last letter, and she hands it to him, apologizing that it is wrinkled and faded and blurred with a few tears. He pretends to read, but he actually recites the letter from memory, as it is a farewell to her from someone who might be dying shortly.Listening to his voice and words, she first feels a special thrill at how eloquently he reads, but then recognizes the voice as the one she heard from her balcony many years before. As she turns to look, Roxane realizes that he is reciting from memory a letter that supposedly he has never seen before. It dawns on her it was Cyrano all the time: all the letters, all the words. She says, ""It was you!""But it is too late. Cyrano slips into delirium and gets up with a last bit of energy. Refusing to die sitting down, he takes his sword in hand for the upcoming battle against Death, challenging Death with his final words, which sum up his life: ""my white plume.""Cyrano falls dead, and Roxane is left to mourn the death of a great love for the second time."

He provides comedy relief for the entire story, which is quite welcome and wonderful.)The space ship travels to the moon and on the way, a problem develops which requires that crew members go outside of the travelling ship in space suits, and make a repair. One crew member accidentally drifts off into space, but is rescued by another crew member who, creatively, uses an oxygen tank to propel himself to connect with the adrift fellow crew member in danger of being lost in space forever. The rescue scene is all done dramatically and believably, and this is true of additional dramatic moments in the movie. Much of the movie is gripping, and comic moments, well done, are welcome interludes to dramatic crisis parts of DESTINATION MOON (!950).The space ship lands on the moon, and the commander claims the moon for the USA on behalf of all mankind in a statement quite similar to the actual statement the first NASA moon landing astronauts made famous in 1969 (the ""one small step for man, one giant step for mankind"" statement).Suddenly, the four moon explorers learn the space ship they need for return to the Earth is too heavily loaded for departure from the moon, and that they need to unload large quantities of equipment and supplies to lighten the ship and make departure possible.They pitch out large quantities of ""junk"" including used oxygen tanks, radios, and other large metal objects, but in the end, not enough has been removed....110 pounds remain!All four travellers separately volunteer to remain behind, and one (the comic ""Joe Sweeny from Brooklyn"") actually leaves the ship and refuses to return so his remaining three comrades can leave safely.His sacrifice isn't necessary, however, since the ship commander determines that the remaining radio used for contact with the Earth can also be thrown off the ship, and so can the one space suit held back and worn by Joe Sweeny, once he returns to the ship.Sweeny does return to the ship and all four travellers depart successfully from the spacecraft after the radio and space suit are thrown out, and the needed weight removal is accomplished.The ship returns to the Earth with all four travellers safely aboard. The final end credit appears over the outer space scene showing the space ship returning from the moon to the earth after the very first space voyage to the moon by people from Earth.The final credit for DESTINATION MOON (!950) reads ""This is THE END..Of The Beginning.""DESTINATION MOON (1950) is a landmark science fiction space travel movie, and should be seen by all interested in this genre, and by all interested in high water mark quality cinema movies remarkable for creativity and intelligence."

Sure enough, the brothers follow, but Ringo gets the drop on them a few miles outside of town. He slightly wounds one of them before disarming the group and scattering their horses. The men are forced to pursue Ringo on foot.Ringo rides on to the small town of Cayenne and stops by the Palace Bar, where he is once again recognized by the bartender, Mac (Karl Malden). Mac explains that he and Ringo had crossed paths years ago in Dodge City. Ringo orders breakfast and goes out back to wash up. Mac sends a boy to alert Marshal Mark Strett (Millard Mitchell) that Ringo is in town. Strett gets three men to accompany him to the saloon, where he surprises Ringo. It turns out that Ringo and Strett had ridden together before Strett went straight and became a lawman. The Marshal makes it clear that he wants Ringo to leave town before trouble follows. Ringo admits that some men are after him, but explains that they are still hours away, and he tells Strett that he has come to Cayenne to see his old girlfriend and the son they had together before they became estranged. Strett fiercely protects the privacy of the woman, Peggy Walsh (Helen Westcott), but he agrees to approach her and see if she is open to a meeting with Ringo. Strett also sends a deputy to deliver a warning to young, hotheaded, local gunhand Hunt Bromley (Skip Homeier), hoping to head off another needless shooting. In the meantime, Ringo finds out that Bromley had once tried unsuccessfully to move in on Peggy.Bromley soon rides into town and hears that Ringo is at the Palace Saloon. The young gun hand walks into the saloon and loudly orders a whiskey. He immediately complains about the ""watered down"" whiskey and demands a round for the whole house to prove his point. He carries a bottle over to Ringo's table and aggressively insists that Ringo try the whiskey. When Ringo demurs, Bromley presses the point. Ringo dismissively insults the cocky young man and advises him to leave while he still can. When Bromley tries to push the issue further, Ringo coolly informs him that he is holding a revolver under the table, pointed directly at the young man. He orders Bromley to turn around and walk out, humiliating him.Meanwhile, the three brothers who are after Ringo have made it on foot to a relay station where fresh horses and guns are available for them. They saddle up and head for Cayenne, with the horses allowing them to arrive hours earlier than Ringo had anticipated.When a girlfriend tells Peggy that Ringo came to town expressly to see her and the boy, she is still hesitant. The friend further explains that Ringo has matured and mellowed, but Peggy isn't ready to believe it. She can't abide returning to a life of sudden violence and insecurity.The Marshal now orders Hunt Bromley out of town in hopes of avoiding another confrontation and also sends his deputy to the saloon to keep an eye on things. The situation becomes even more complicated thanks to an angry citizen who mistakenly believes that Ringo killed his son. Rooming at the hotel across the street from the saloon, the man keeps watch from a window and waits on his chance to get even. When Ringo and the deputy step through the saloon door, the man aims a rifle at Ringo, who fortunately sees the sun glint on the barrel. He quickly retreats into the saloon, sneaks out the back door, and climbs the rear stairs of the hotel. He gets the drop on the man and takes him to the marshal's office to lock him up. Finding no one present at the jail, Ringo locates the keys and does the honors himself.A comedic interlude ensues when a delegation of proper townswomen arrives at the marshal's office, led by elderly Mrs. August Pennyfeather. Mistaking Ringo for a jailer, they announce their demand that the Marshal and his deputies arrest the ""murderous"" gunfighter immediately. Flummoxed, Ringo politely plays along, identifying himself as a friend of Marshal Strett. As the women stridently denounce Ringo's violent history, Ringo stays in his jailer character and tries to defend his own past as if he were just an unbiased advocate for a presumably innocent stranger. He chalks many of the killings up to a ""misunderstanding."" When Mrs. Pennyfeather sarcastically decries Ringo's ""fifty"" misunderstandings, Ringo protests and corrects the record down to fifteen or so. They then accuse him of unfairly taking up for the murderous gunman. In response, Ringo lamely concedes that a case could perhaps be made for having the gunslinger arrested or run out of town. Another woman then demands that the killer be hung, with Ringo growing more and more uncomfortable by the minute. Just in the nick of time, Marshal Strett arrives. He answers the ladies' fervent demands for action by saying that Ringo will soon be on his way out of town without any bloodletting required. Mrs. Pennyfeather says she is satisfied to wait for another hour or so, after which time Ringo should be ""shot down like a dog."" They thank Marshal Strett for his reasonable attitude before he gestures toward ""Mr. Ringo"" and suggests they thank him instead. Horrified, the chastened women quickly shuffle out of the jail.Strett now procures a fresh horse for Ringo and prepares to hustle him out of town. Just as Ringo saddles up, Peggy finally arrives to meet with him and delays his departure. He begs her to give him a second chance at settling down with her and the boy and she finally agrees to consider it if he is still alive in another year. Elated, Ringo asks to see his son before he leaves. While he waits, the three vengeful brothers arrive; one covers the saloon's front entrance while the others prepare an ambush from a hayloft behind the saloon, where Ringo's saddled horse is waiting. Ringo has a brief meeting with the boy and establishes some tentative ties. Finally saying his goodbyes, Ringo and Strett exit the rear of the saloon. Just as two of the three brothers prepare to ambush Ringo, Strett's deputy sights them from down below and aims his shotgun at them. They surrender and it appears that all is clear for Ringo's escape. He mounts up and starts to ride off. Just then, Hunt Bromley steps out from behind a wagon and shoots Ringo twice in the back. Mortally wounded, Ringo is helped out of the stirrups and stretched out in the alleyway. The smirking Bromley is dragged over to view his cowardly handiwork, and Ringo surprises everyone by saying that he drew first on Bromley, and that Bromley had beaten him. Strett objects to the obvious lie, but Ringo looks Bromley squarely in the eye and explains that by doing it this way he has condemned the young man to an uncertain, dangerous future as the man who got the infamous Jimmy Ringo, fair and square. Every young gun within reach will be out to earn a reputation by killing him. Ringo closes his eyes for the last time as Strett drags Bromley into a barn, administering a savage beating before running him out of town. Ringo's funeral, at which Peggy uses the name Mrs. Ringo for the first time, closes the movie."

tt0042546,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Fantasy']","Elwood P. Dowd is an endlessly pleasant and delightfully eccentric bachelor living in a small town that isn't quite aware that its newest citizen is a invisible, 6'3"" white rabbit named ""Harvey,"" that only certain people can see. After supposedly meeting this rabbit - its origins attributed to the Celtic legend of the Pooka - Dowd's sanity is put into question by his equally eccentric sister, Veta Louise.Elwood casually drives his sister's guests from their house by introducing and carrying on one-sided conversations with his invisible and silent friend. His sister and niece, Myrtle Mae, resort to taking him to the local sanitarium to have him committed. However, owing to people not paying attention, interrupting, and cutting Elwood off as he is about to introduce his imaginary friend, it doesn't immediately appear that there is anything wrong with him, although the examining doctor is sure he is doing the right thing by admitting him.Elwood is carted upstairs by a rough-handed and simple-minded man in the white coat while the examining doctor ushers the sister into the head psychiatrist's --Dr. Chumley's-- office to give a description of the problem. As Elwood is ""escorted"" to hydrotherapy, he tells the man in the white coat his friend ""Harvey"" is a ""Pooka"" The Aide later looks up the definition in the dictionary: ""Celtic mythology, a mischievous spirit that takes animal form and appears sometimes to some people for the purpose of doing this and that.""As Veta, still highly upset over Elwood driving away her friends, bemoans Elwoods delusions to Dr. Chumley, her frazzled manner and insistence that Elwood actually does have a six foot 3 inch invisible rabbit for a friend convinces Chumley it is she, not Elwood, who is hallucinating.He quickly has Veta carted upstairs and, fearing a lawsuit for incarcerating and treating a sane man, brings Elwood down and makes every manner of friendly gesture, including firing the examining doctor, Dr. Sanderson . His nurse, Miss Kelly, who is actually quite fond of Dr. Sanderson, is crestfallen, but, upset at being fired, the good doctor is unaware of her feelings for him, and this angers her.Elwood in his normal good natured way takes no exception to any of the events and once again, as he is about to introduce ""Harvey,"" gets cut off, interrupted and ignored while Dr. Chumley pursues his patronizing commentary. Never one to interrupt, the pinnacle of politeness, Elwood lets him say whatever he is going to say and is finally given a pass to leave. Soon Veta's friends, including Judge Gaffney, and Myrtle Mae arrive. The mistake is uncovered, and the entire group goes into a panic trying to find Elwood. Veta and the Judge Gaffney promise to sue the sanitarium for wrongful incarceration and rough treatment.Distraught, Elwood drinks heavily and retires to his favorite watering hole, Charlie's. Dr. Chumley, himself, tracks Elwood down, but while he is doing this, everyone else is looking in other places. When it finally becomes apparent to everyone that the Doctor has been gone for over four hours and that Elwood is not back in custody, another major panic ensues and the group descends on Charlie's to see what has happened to Dr. Chumley.Elwood, of course, is sitting alone, drinking, and maintains that the doctor left the bar with Harvey. They are convinced he is a madman and has done away with the doctor. However, in his easygoing and pleasant manner, Elwood sidetracks everyone with drinks and conversation and disarms them. Eventually the subject does turn back to the missing doctor, and the panic ensues again.The police are summoned, the heavy handed man in the white coat muscles Elwood back to the sanitarium, but not before becoming infatuated with Myrtle Mae and making advances toward her. Although he is a big galoot, she's attracted to him. The entire entourage, of Veta, Myrtle Mae, Dr. Sanderson, Miss Kelly, Judge Gaffney, the guard and the police, arrive at the sanitarium in a police car and a taxi to discover the doctor is there.However, Dr. Chumley arrives back at the hospital with a look of admiration and fear. Dr. Chumley indeed did leave with Harvey, the Pooka, but he wisely does not say anything about it to anyone, dismisses them all and tells everyone that everything is under control. He tells Dr. Sanderson that he is a fine doctor and can have his job back, then disappears into his office. Sanderson then decides to administer a very powerful injection, called Formula 977, into Elwood that will make him cease with his delusions about the rabbit for once and for all.Meanwhile the cab driver wants his money for the fare. No one seems to have any money so Veta says she'll pay. Digging everything out of her handbag, she discovers her money is gone. She assures the driver that if he waits until Elwood has his injection, she'll pay him handsomely when they are driven back home. The Cab driver however has dour insights into the effects of the injection about to be administered to Elwood. He says he's given many people a ride to the sanitarium for that injection and it changes them into crabby mean people; normal but irritable and unpleasant. Elwood, the most disarming and engaging and mild mannered man in the universe, is on the verge of being turned permanently into a real nuisance, so Veta abruptly changes her mind and rushes in and prevents the injection.Dr. Chumley asks to see Elwood privately in his office where Elwood tells him tells the incredible story of how he came to meet Harvey, and explains the way in which people react when they meet them. Elwood also explains that Harvey has the power to stop time by saying:""Did I tell you he could stop clocks? Well, you've heard the expression 'His face would stop a clock'? Well, Harvey can look at your clock and stop it. And you can go anywhere you like, with anyone you like, and stay as long as you like. And when you get back, not one minute will have ticked by. You see, science has overcome time and space. Well, Harvey has overcome not only time and space, but any objections.""By this point, Dr. Chumley is not only convinced of Harvey's existence, but has begun spending time with him on his own, and requests that Elwood allow Harvey to stay with him for a while and help him out by making his long-needed sabbatical a reality. Apparently this is one of the things Harvey can do if he is so inclined. Elwood asks Harvey if he will work with Chumley and tells Chumley that Harvey agrees.Dr. Sanderson pays for the cab and warms up to the nurse who has a crush on him. The entourage leaves, with the heavy-handed guard and Myrtle Mae making a date to see each other. As the sister digs in her pocketbook she discovers her money purse. She looks over her shoulder and says knowingly, ""Harvey,"" and shakes her head. She knew Harvey existed, and was mischievous, and her only reason for wanting to have Elwood committed was that Elwood's insistence on introducing him to her guests was driving everyone away.As Elwood is leaving, Dr. Chumley asks Elwood for Harvey's help, and Elwood, being the obliging fellow he is, makes no objection. Dr. Chumley, arm in arm with an invisible companion, asks ""Have you ever been to Akron?""In the final shot, after the gates to Chumley's Residence are closed, and Elwood is leaving, he stops, turns around and has a conversation with an invisible Harvey, who is already back from his trip to Akron (only a few minutes have gone by, but it was weeks due to Harvey the Pooka stopping time) and reaffirms their friendship. Harvey opens the security gate (showing only the control handles moving by themselves; Harvey is never seen on camera), and Elwood and his invisible companion saunter off towards the bus stop, following Veta and Myrtle Mae, towards the planned last stop of Charlie's Bar and another drink."
tt0042593,"['Drama', 'FilmNoir', 'Mystery', 'Romance', 'Thriller']","Dixon ""Dix"" Steele (Humphrey Bogart) is a talented but violence-prone and washed up screenwriter. Needing money, he reluctantly takes the job of adapting a trashy novel for the screen. Knowing that this is obviously below him, instead of reading the thing he instead asks a naive, celebrity-obsessed girl (who has read the book) he meets at a restaurant to give him a synopsis, which she does enthusiastically. He sends her home with cab money and is abruptly woken up at 5:00 the next morning by a police officer; the girl was found murdered, and Dix was the last person to see her alive. Given his violent past and what appears to be apathy towards her death, he is the most logical suspect until his beautiful neighbor Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame) gives him an alibi (though the audience is never quite sure if she is telling the truth or lies because of her attraction to Dix). There is an undeniable connection between Laurel and Dix, and despite her guarded demeanor and his deep internal demons, the two fall madly in love and for a while they enjoy the happiest time of their lives. Meanwhile, the murder investigation continues and Dix is still the most likely suspect. This puts immense strain on their relationship. The pressure on him is mounting, and as he begins to become increasingly impatient and irritable, this makes her back away from him. Sensing this, he is so frightened he'll lose Laurel, he clings ever more tightly to her, which appears controlling and frightens her. After hearing she didn't tell him about going down to the police station to answer more questions, he storms off and almost kills an innocent bystander, and is only stopped by Laurel's plea. After that incident, Laurel begins to truly doubt Dix's innocence. Dix senses this and from the strain of the accusation, the novel and his fears of losing Laurel, his violence has started up again. In addition, his controlling ways continue to increase from his desperation as she pulls further and further away from him emotionally. Though she loves Dix, Laurel fears for her life and plans to leave him. When Dix finds out, he flies into a rage and nearly strangles the woman he loves; the only thing that stops him is a ringing telephone which confirms his innocence. However, he walks away anything but a free man, having lost forever the one person who he truly loved, who truly loved him, and could've made him happy enough to help him deal with his violent nature."

His vow is soon broken, however, when he meets Englishwoman Elizabeth Curtis, who persuades him to take her and her brother John Goode on a dangerous expedition into the continent's interior to find her missing husband Henry. As Allan needs money to send to his son in England, he accepts Elizabeth's offer of five thousand English pounds to lead the safari. As his only clue to Henry's whereabouts, Allan is given a crude, four-hundred -year-old map to King Solomon's diamond mines, Henry's destination. From the outset, Allan questions Elizabeth's motives, but his first theory, that she must find Henry's body to claim his inheritance money, proves false when he learns that she is wealthy. The expedition moves slowly toward its first goal, Kalawanna village, an area not visited by a white man in more than five years. When a violent stampede of zebras, giraffes and other wild animals forces the expedition members to take cover, Elizabeth and Allan fall into an accidental embrace. As time passes, a mild but contentious romance between Elizabeth and Allan begins to flourish. Just before approaching Kalawanna, Allan's native escorts encounter a Kalawanna rattle snake, which they know to be a bad omen, and they flee. Elizabeth and John are Allan's only remaining companions until a mysterious and silent native asks to join them. When the four enter the eerie village of Kalawanna, they are immediately taken by the villagers to Kalawanna's only white man, the sinister Smith, who tells them that he met Henry one year earlier. Allan suddenly remembers that Smith is wanted for cannibalistic murder, and realizing that Smith has no intention of letting them get out alive, he quickly overpowers him and forces him to instruct his army of natives to let them leave. Allan takes Smith hostage to ensure their safe passage, and when Smith tries to escape, Allan shoots him. During a brutal desert passage Allan and Elizabeth find the handle of Henry's rifle, and Allan suspects that Henry is dead. Elizabeth then confesses to Allan that she is searching for Henry as a form of penance for not loving her husband enough and running out on him. Later Allan discovers that their mysterious African companion is a Watusi king returning to claim the kingdom that was stolen from him. Upon entering the Watusi village, the reigning king shows Allan, John and Elizabeth the direction of King Solomon's Mines. The rebel king's apparent hospitality is short-lived, however, as some of his men follow Allan and the others and set off a rock slide to trap them. After discovering a human skull in the mines, the three believe the situation to be hopeless until they discover a passageway to freedom. Allan, John and Elizabeth return to the Watusi village in time to witness the rightful king win his kingdom back from the rebels in a battle. They then begin their journey home."

tt0042832,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'FilmNoir', 'Thriller']","At night, on a seedy street of New Orleans, we see an upper floor window that is thrown open. In that room a poker game is under way. One of the players is seaman Kochak (Lewis Charles), who gathers a large pot he has just won and says he feels sick and needs to go rest. The other players object, Blackie (Jack Palance), Raymond Fitch, ( Zero Mostel), and Poldi (Guy Tomajan), claiming that it was too early to quit. Despite threats, Kochak leaves. Blackie quickly talks to the other two, ordering them to bring back Kochak or the money. Raymond and Poldi follow Kochak out, stop him and push him, but Kochak continues on his way. Raymond and Poldi are giving up, but an angry Blackie demands that he be followed. Some distance away, in the dock area, Kochak is surrounded, there is a brief fight. Blackie kills Kochak with two shots and orders Raymond and Poldi to get rid of the body after retrieving the money.The next morning, Dr. Clinton Reed, a U.S. Public Health Service officer (Richard Widmark) is at home looking forward to a day off with his wife Nancy (Barbara Bel Geddes) and son Tommy (Tommy Rettig), We see him as a family man painting furniture with his young son. Later he and the wife discuss how it appears they can't make ends meet with his salary, as there are bills that have gone unpaid for quite a while.From a dock on the river front, the dead body of Kochak has been spotted, and policemen pick it up and take it to the morgue. The coroner technician digs out the two bullets and notices something strange with the body. Immediately he isolates the body and phones Dr. Reed at home.Dr. Reed reluctantly agrees to come back to the morgue, and confirms the dead man had pneumonic plague, similar to bubonic plague but attacking the lungs, and transmitted not by rats but by coughing and sneezing and physical contact among people. He takes charge, isolates everyone who touched the body, has the body cremated and starts inoculating the policemen and morgue technicians.At a hastily summoned emergency meeting with mayor Murray (H. Fowler, Jr.), police chief Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) and other authorities, Reed describes the potentially enormous consequences and deaths that could ensue from not finding those infected. Death occurs within four days of the onset of illness, and illness within about two days of contagious exposure. So they have a 48 hour window to try to find those exposed and prevent further illnesses by inoculations.Since the dead man was moved by his killers, the killers have been exposed and must be found. The search has to be done with a different excuse, otherwise the killers might leave town and potentially infect the whole nation. The secret must also be kept from the public, otherwise there would be a mass exodus that might spread the illness through a vast area.The mayor supports Reed, the rest go along very reluctantly. Warren objects that he has an impossible job because the murder victim is unidentified, but grumblingly he promises to do his best. Reed and Warren display short tempers and grudging respect for each other as they start off on their search for the killers.Warren orders a round up of all known petty criminals and suspects, who are shown a picture of the murder victim and are asked what they know. Reed is so involved an intense that he gets in the way of the police procedures, so he goes on his own to try other ways to identify the murder victim.Dr. Reed goes into the seamens hiring hall and offers a $50 reward to anyone who can identify the murder victim, to no avail. He senses there is a reluctance to give information, so he announces he will wait at a nearby caf√©, Franks Place just in case anyone wants to talk to him. After some waiting, a girl comes to him and says she thinks she knows a boat owner who might have seen the unidentified victim. Reed follows her to a boat and the owner denies knowing anything. After some pushing, the owner says he also owns a caf√© that is run by his wife and will ask his wife.At the caf√©, the wife is consulted by her husband out of sight from Reed. She recognizes the man but refuses to admit it. She complains of having a headache, and she starts to cough.Meantime, Blackie, Raymond and Poldi have sensed that the police is after something important, and Blackie guesses that the dead man, who was Poldi's cousin, is much more important than one would guess from a merchant seaman, and imagine that Kochak had information about some treasure or drug stash.A scene in Blackies supposed legitimate business serves to define the characters of both Blackie and Raymond. Blackie argues with Raymond and his shrewish wife (Liswood), and shows Raymonds frantic subservience as he tries to pacify each, like some berserk pinball.There are brief scenes where Blackie's complex character is further developed. When a stunning prostitute asks Blackie for $100 (the equivalent of $1000 in 2010), he doesn't hesitate. When a little newspaper seller gives him some information, he insists on giving money to him, although, he doesn't want it. When a doctor tells him that the man he is trying to kill is sick and needs an expensive sanitarium, Blackie quickly offers the money. He may be a killer, but he sure is generous.The film intersperses small scenes that grab attention simply by making the characters and their little exchanges interesting. Like the Irish dwarf, for instance, who refuses to take payment for his favors, looking up at the towering Blackie, saying, ""No, Blackie, no."" And then after Blackie stuffs the bills into his sweater, he hobbles away backwards and saying, ""God bless ye, Blackie, God bless ye.""In the same vein, Reeds character is developed as struggles with his status as a nearly absentee dad, slaving away at a job that pays him poorly and barely managing to spend any time with his wife and son. The $50 reward he offers for information means the bill he was going to pay will have to wait.Blackie starts to suspect Poldi of holding out on him, since Kochak was Poldi's cousin, so Poldi disappears trying to get away from Blackie.Meantime, the wife of the caf√© owner has been taken to a hospital, and dies from the plague. Her husband arrives, and Dr. Reed is able to extract more information due to the heavy guilt and grief. Kochak is identified as having arrived in a ship called the Queen of the Nile, which is still within reach of the authorities.The ship is boarded, and despite the Captains denials and lack of cooperation, Reed succeeds in questioning the crew, and finds that there had been a recent death on board. The interview of two Asian cooks aboard the Nile Queen is hilarious -- ""He cawr me dirty names and ask for Shishabob!"" Later, loudly proclaiming that the crew will start dying in just a few days, Reed succeeds in convincing the seamen to get inoculated. The captain yields as his crew starts to mutiny.During these searches, three times, Reed just misses meeting up with Raymond. The viewer is tantalized with both men in the same frame but unaware of the connection between them.The film has a subplot in which a news reporter, who wears his ""Freedom of Speech"" as a badge of honour, is shut down and locked away in a jail, to prevent him from publishing a story that might indeed trigger panic in the streets. This is a decision by the mayor at the urging of Reed that gives rise to a brief discussion of Constitutional rights.Eventually Blackie finds and interrogates the dying Poldi as to the precise nature of his cousin's presumed contraband. Cat like, Blackie stalks his victim across the room, eventually preying over the doomed man's sick bed, holding Poldi's feverish head in his hands. Meantime, Poldi's mother has summoned a nurse, whose entrance prevents Blackie from torturing the dying Poldi. She is aware of the seriousness of Poldi's condition, and refuses to leave. Blackie summons his own doctor, and the doctor expels the nurse, who manages to get messages to Reed about the situation. Were it not for the serendipitous perceptive nurse, Reed and Warren might still be looking for the killers.The doctor together with Blackie Fitch start to move Poldi out of his room and down some stairs and this is when they meet up with Reed. Poldi is thrown down to his death, and an exciting chase follows. Blackie and Raymond hijack a van to flee, as they are being chased by Reed, Warren, and half the New Orleans Police, first in 1949 Ford police cars, then on foot after the van is surrounded. The two escaping killers try to throw off the pursuers in a coffee and bananas warehouse where they hide among the mountains of burlap coffee bags.

tt0042869,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'FilmNoir', 'Mystery', 'Romance']","Dan Brady, an auto mechanic with Mackey Motor Co., is having lunch on Monday with a couple of buddies at the lunch counter. Dan, who spent four years in the Navy, has broken off with his girlfriend Helen because she was getting serious about marriage. A new cashier, Vera Novak, enters the restaurant and captures the young men's attention. Dan is persistent and asks Vera out on a date that night and she agrees. Dan doesn't have any money and can't borrow it from his friends and Buzz who owes him $20 can't repay him until the next day. Dan runs the parts counter and has a cash register float he is responsible for that doesn't get checked until Thursday. Dan decides to ""borrow"" $20 and pay it back before the company bookkeeper checks on Thursday. Dan's former girlfriend Helen drops by the garage and is still interested in Dan but he blows her off.
When Dan picks up Vera she wants to go window shopping downtown. Vera is fascinated by a $2,000 mink coat that she is desperate to have. Vera then takes Dan to Joyland, a penny arcade where she used to work, and he meets Nick Dramoshag, the sleazy proprietor.
The next day at the garage the bookkeeper shows up early to do some tax reports for Mackey. Dan rushes out and tries unsuccessfully to get a payday loan. He then decides to purchase a $100 watch with $1 dollar down and $10 monthly payments and promptly takes the watch down the street and pawns it for $30 to reimburse his employer. Dan is confronted by the bookkeeper and deviously slips the missing $20 back into the cash sack.
A car pulls into the garage and Moriarity from California Investigation Services hassles Dan about the watch as the jewelry shop owner is worried Dan will skip out on the payments as he has hocked the watch. Moriarity explains the conditional sales agreement means Dan doesn't own the watch and his selling or hocking it constitutes larceny. Dan is given 24 hours to repay the $100. Dan tries selling his jalopy, but the $300 he is offered is less than the $350 he owes the finance company on the car. Dan goes into a bar and notices a drunk who has a large amount of cash. Dan follows the drunk to the parking lot and uses his handkerchief as a mask takes the drunk's wallet. Dan escapes into an alley, removes the cash, and then notices Helen and her friend walking by and he joins them to evade suspicion. He leaves Helen to go meet up with Vera.
Vera is at Joyland in an argument with Nick over $50 which he says he loaned her and she claims was a gift. Dan hits Nick, cuts his hand and throws a $50 bill at him to settle the debt and drops his bloody handkerchief. Nick figures out where the $50 came from as does Vera.
The next day Dan pays off Moriarity. Nick calls him at work and arranges a meeting. Nick blackmails Dan into stealing a new car from Mackey Motors so Nick can resell it to someone leaving the state. Dan leaves a window unlocked and slips in that night to Mackey's and steals a new car and delivers it to Nick and trades the car key for his bloody handkerchief.
Mackey comes by the next day and tells Dan he knows who stole the car. Mackey gives Dan 24 hours to return the car or pay him the retail value of $3,000. Dan meets Vera at the cafe and asks her to run away with him to Texas. Vera gets the whole story and tells Dan she knows where there is 3 or 4 thousand dollars that can be taken easily. Nick has large amounts of cash on hand to cover payroll checks. Dan breaks in and steals the money and get chased and shot at by the watchman. Dan goes to Vera's and leaves the cash behind when they are interrupted by her landlady who kicks Dan out.
Dan goes to work the next day and makes an appointment to pay Mackey that night. Dan is frantic trying to get hold of Vera. When he goes to her place, he finds she has taken half the money, her half, and paid $1,800 for the mink coat from the window. Dan is upset but Vera convinces him to take his $1,800 and make an offer to Mackey to settle the issue. Mackey accepts the $1,800 and then starts to make a call to the police and tells Dan the deal was for the full $3,000 and Mackey pulls out a pistol. Dan jumps him across the desk and strangles him and leaves with his pistol.
Dan goes to Vera's and by coincidence meets Helen with his friend and fellow employee Chuck out on a date on the street. Chuck tells Dan that Mackey called him into his office and blamed him for stealing the car and asked him for $3,000 and Chuck quit. Dan realizes Mackey has conned him.
Dan goes into Vera's and again asks her to go to Texas with him as he believes he has killed Mackey. Vera has no intention of running and Dan leaves in disgust. The police arrive at Vera's causing Dan to hide on the fire escape. The police, acting on a tip from Nick, have a search warrant and find the mink coat and the receipt for $1,800. Vera rats Dan out about Mackey which is news to the police. Vera is arrested and Dan escapes.
Dan finds Helen waiting in his car. They drive away and Dan is pulled over by a motorcycle cop on a traffic offense and Helen stops him from pulling the gun. Dan then admits all to Helen. Helen suggests they run away to Mexico and on the way Dan's car engine's bearing fails. Dan and Helen then hijack an older man in a car and force him to drive them to the border. The old man turns out to be a lawyer and offers Dan advice and suggests that Mackey may not be dead. Dan changes his mind about driving to the border and orders the lawyer to drive him to his friend's charter boat that is heading south to Mexican waters on a fishing trip that morning. Two motorcycle police are at the wharf and end up chasing Dan. Dan drops his pistol, it goes off, and the police end up shooting Dan in the shoulder and capturing him.
Helen and the lawyer have heard on the radio that Mackey is not dead and come back to the wharf to rescue Dan. The lawyer joins Helen and Dan in the backseat of his car which the police are going to use to drive Dan to the hospital. The lawyer advises Dan he will be charged with the robbery, stealing the car and the break in at Nick's but that he is a first time offender and should get a minimal sentence. Helen pledges to wait for Dan and the car drives away."
tt0042876,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery']","Sheltering from a rainstorm in the ruins of the Rashomon gatehouse, a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) and a priest (Minoru Chiaki) sit dejected. A commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) joins them, and wants to hear the ""strange story"" they have just heard at a murder enquiry in the courthouse garden. The story has horrified the priest. Even though ""year after year, it's been nothing but disasters,"" he has ""never heard a story as horrible as this."" The woodcutter is utterly confounded, and hopes the commoner can help him understand it.The woodcutter begins the narration, telling the commoner that three days earlier he had gone ""into the mountains to get wood.""The woodcutter is walking through the woods, carrying his axe. Sunlight filters through the foliage, dappling everything with a mix of sun and sharp shadows. He sees a woman's hat caught on a bush. Further along, he picks up a samurai's hat and some cut up rope. He sees something small amongst the leaves on the ground, and goes towards it, but does not notice the corpse right in front of him until he trips over it. He screams and, dropping everything (including his axe), runs away. He says, ""I ran as fast as I could to tell the police. Then, three days later--today--I was called to testify.""The woodcutter is seated in the sunlit courthouse garden, addressing the court, unseen and unheard behind the camera. He testifies that he is the one who found the body. Asked if he saw ""a sword or something,"" he protests emphatically that he found ""nothing at all"" but the hats, rope, and ""a shiny amulet case."" And here he lets slip two additional details: the rope was ""near the body"" and the amulet case had ""a red lining.""The priest is seated in the courthouse garden. He testifies that he saw the man three days earlier, travelling on the road with a woman on a horse, and armed with a sword and bow and arrows. [There is a brief shot of the samurai passing on the road, turning to smile at his wife.] The priest comments on the fragility of life and offers condolences to someone off screen--presumably the wife.The policeman (Daisuke Kato) is seated in the courthouse garden. The bandit (Toshiro Mifune) is sitting beside him, bound. The policeman identifies the bandit as the notorious Tajomaru. He had captured him two days earlier, at dusk. [There is a brief shot of the policeman finding the bandit writhing in agony on a riverbank. The bandit pushes him into the river.] He describes the weapons and horse belonging to the samurai. He concludes that Tajomaru must have fallen from the stolen horse.The bandit hotly denies falling from his horse. [There is a brief shot depicting the bandit as he wants to be perceived: galloping in heroic mode across the horizon, with stirring music.] He explains to the court that he was thirsty, and drank from a spring. [There is a brief shot of him drinking thirstily from a stream.] He says it must have been contaminated, because he was ill and had to get off the horse. The bandit says he knows he is doomed, so he has no reason to hide anything. He says it was he who killed the samurai. [There is a scene of the bandit lounging against a large tree, watching as the samurai (Masayuki Mori) and his wife (Machiko Kyo) pass by, the samurai eyeing the bandit warily.] The bandit says he initially intended ""to take her without killing the man.""Throughout the woodcutter's narration of the bandit's testimony the bandit's bravado and dignity are undercut. He has animal-like mannerisms, and appears indolent and ignoble, constantly scratching and swatting flies.The bandit runs through the woods to catch up to the couple. He accosts the samurai, lures him into the woods with a tale of a cache of swords he will sell cheap, and jumps him from behind. He laughs in triumph, and goes to get the wife, tricking her by saying her husband has suddenly ""taken sick."" In the courthouse garden the bandit says the wife's look of concern made him jealous, and this made him want to humiliate the samurai.Running through the woods, led by the bandit, the wife loses her hat. When they reach the grove she sees her husband tied to a tree stump. The wife, at first frozen and powerless, suddenly draws a dagger and fiercely attacks the bandit. She struggles, but eventually gives up. The bandit kisses her. She drops the dagger and embraces him.In the court the bandit says that he ""had succeeded in having her without killing her husband."" Having got what he wanted, it would make sense for the bandit to leave the scene while he can easily get away.In the grove, the bandit begins to leave, taking the samurai's sword. But the woman makes a bizarre melodramatic request that the men duel to the death. In response, he frees the samurai and lets him have his sword back. There is a fierce, dramatic sword fight. The bandit finally kills the samurai.In the courthouse garden the bandit boasts that it was an honourable, impressive fight, claiming they ""crossed swords 23 times."" When asked about the woman, he has to think a moment about this odd loose end, and supposes she ran off in fright (contrary to the fierce spirit that had attracted him). Responding to further questions, the bandit says that he sold the samurai's sword to buy liquor, and that he had forgotten the dagger--a ""foolish"" mistake, as it ""looked very valuable.""In the Rashomon gatehouse the woodcutter says the bandit's and the woman's stories were lies. The commoner observes that this is human. ""Most of the time we can't even be honest with ourselves."" The priest laments that this is because men are ""weak."" The priest says the woman was found hiding in a temple, and that she appeared at the enquiry. He says she showed no fierceness, was ""almost pitiful.""The priest takes over the narration, and begins relating the woman's testimony.The woman is in the courthouse garden, prostrate and weeping. She says after forcing her to ""yield to him"" the bandit laughed mockingly. In the grove, the bandit takes the samurai's sword and runs off. The woman embraces her bound husband, but he remains impassive. In the court, the woman says she saw ""neither anger, nor sorrow, but a cold light, a look of loathing."" In the grove, she begs him to stop, but he continues to look at her with cold disdain. She collapses in despair, then retrieves the dagger, cuts his bonds, and tells him to kill her. When he does not respond, she pleads for him to stop condemning her with his silence, and repeats this over and over as she approaches him with the dagger clenched in her hand.In the courthouse garden she says that she must have fainted and that when she came to she saw her dagger in her dead husband's chest. She says she remembers only a pond [There is a brief shot of the surface of a pond.], and throwing herself in, and failing with several other attempts to kill herself. She dissolves in tears.In the Rashomon gatehouse, the commoner comments that women ""use their tears to fool everyone."" The priest mentions ""the dead man's story,"" explaining that ""he spoke through a medium."" The woodcutter says, ""His story was also lies,"" and he looks away from them, agitated. The priest refuses to believe a dead man would be so sinful as to lie, but the cynical commoner observes: ""But is there anyone who's really good? Maybe goodness is just make-believe. . . Man just wants to forget the bad stuff and believe in the made-up good stuff. It's easier that way."" He asks the priest to continue.In the courthouse garden, the medium (Fumiko Honma) performs a ritual around a small altar, and goes into a trance. When she speaks, it is the samurai's voice that is heard.The medium/samurai tells a story that incorporates sentiments and actions that vilify the woman, and are out of character and illogical for the bandit, but that result in the bandit and the woman leaving separately, with the samurai free of his bonds. In this sequence there are frequent cuts between the grove and the courthouse garden.The medium/samurai says the bandit ""tried to console his wife."" In the grove, the bandit is kneeling by the woman, who is lying on the ground. He ""was cunning,"" telling the woman that he loved her, and that she should marry him now. She gives in to him, and agrees to go with him ""wherever."" But then she tells the bandit to kill her husband. The bandit is appalled, throws her to the ground, and asks the samurai what he wants: ""Kill her or save her? You only have to nod."" The medium/samurai laughs with triumphant satisfaction, and says: ""For those words alone, I was ready to pardon his crime.""The woman runs away. The bandit chases her, but is unable to catch her. He returns, exhausted and frustrated. He cuts the samurai's bindings, and leaves, taking both swords. The samurai weeps. He sees his wife's dagger, and uses it to stab himself. In court, the medium collapses. In the background, the woodcutter's attention is riveted. The medium/samurai says: ""Then someone quietly approached me. That someone gently withdrew the dagger from my heart."" When the medium's testimony stops there, the woodcutter relaxes.In the Rashomon gatehouse, the woodcutter paces thoughtfully. He suddenly asserts: ""Its not true! There was no dagger. He was killed by a sword."" The commoner looks skeptical, and presses the woodcutter to explain how he knows this. The woodcutter avoids eye contact when he claims that he was a witness, but did not tell the court because he ""didn't want to get involved."" He says he came upon the scene and, from behind a bush, observed the bandit begging the woman for forgiveness.The woodcutter tells a story that incorporates elements from the different stories heard in court. He describes actions that are out of character and implausible, and the demeanor of the characters fluctuates wildly. There is no music--only the sounds of insects, rustling leaves, and gasping breath.In the grove, the bandit begs the woman to go with him, and says he will do anything for her. She retrieves the dagger, and cuts the samurai's bonds. The samurai is still wearing his sword, but just stands there. The bandit assumes she wants them to fight a duel. The samurai refuses to risk his life ""for such a woman."" The bandit starts to leave. The woman laughs derisively, and derides them both for their lack of manhood. This drives the men to fight. The woman laughs, but then looks horrified. The men fight with farcical ineptitude in something resembling an undignified peasant brawl. The bandit finally spears the cowering samurai. The woman recoils from the bandit. He grabs the samurai's sword, and she runs away. He is too exhausted to chase her. He retrieves his own sword, and hobbles away.In the Rashomon gatehouse, the cynical commoner doubts this story. The priest despairs that men cannot trust one another. Then they hear an abandoned baby cry.When the woodcutter berates the commoner for stealing the baby's kimono, the commoner deflects the criticism by condemning the parents who abandoned their child. He says that no one is honest. He hasn't been fooled by the woodcutter. He knows the woodcutter must have stolen the dagger. The woodcutter hangs his head in shame. The commoner slaps the woodcutter, and goes on his way, laughing mockingly.The priest and the woodcutter stand dejected. The rain stops. The woodcutter reaches to take the baby from the priest. The priest recoils, and the woodcutter shakes his head, looking very hurt. He explains: ""I have six kids of my own. Another one wouldn't make a difference."" The priest recognizes that the woodcutter is basically a decent man, ashamed of his petty theft. He apologizes for his mistrust, and thanks him, because now he feels he can keep his faith in man. The priest hands the baby to the woodcutter. They bow to one another, and the woodcutter turns. The priest follows him to the steps of the gatehouse, and the two bow to each other again. The woodcutter leaves, walking into the sunlight. He is looking happy."

tt0043014,"['Drama', 'FilmNoir']","The film opens with the camera tracking down Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, California as police cars begin racing down it. The lifeless body of a young man, Joe Gillis (Holden) floats in the swimming pool of a palatial mansion. As the police begin converging on the house Joe's voice narrates, in flashback style, the events leading up to his own murder.Six months earlier, Joe was down on his luck, unable to find work as a screenwriter, having only made a few undistinguished films in his short career. Broke and on the verge of having his car repossessed, with no other options except a low-paying newspaper job in Ohio, Joe tries to persuade Paramount Pictures producer Sheldrake (Clark) to buy his most recent script, but fails after script reader Betty Schaefer (Olson) gives Sheldrake a harsh critique of the script in her summation. Joe then tries unsuccessfully to borrow money from his friends. Fleeing from repossession men in his car, one of Joe's tires blows out in front of a large and seemingly deserted mansion on Sunset. Hiding the car in the garage, he sets out to explore the decaying house, when a woman inside calls to him. Mistaken for the undertaker to a recently deceased pet chimpanzee, he is ushered in by the mysterious butler, Max Von Mayerling (Von Stroheim). Meeting the woman who owns the house, he recognizes her as long-forgotten silent-film star Norma Desmond (Swanson). When she learns that he is a writer, she invites him in and asks for his opinion on an immense script she has written for a film about Salome that she hopes will revive her faded acting career. Although Joe finds the script awful, he flatters Norma into hiring him as an editor.Joe is put up in her guest room. The next morning he objects when he sees that Max has moved his belongings to the mansion on Norma's orders, and that she has paid his overdue rent. Though he hates being dependent on her, he accepts the situation and begins living at the mansion, first in a room over the garage, then in the mansion itself. As he works on Norma's script, he comes to see how unaware she is of how her fame has died. She refuses to hear any criticism of her work, and makes him watch her old films in the evenings. Although she still receives fan mail, Joe later learns that Max feeds into Norma's fantasy by sending the letters himself. He explains that Norma's state of mind is fragile, and she has attempted suicide in the past.Over the next few weeks, Norma lavishes attention on Joe and buys him expensive clothing, including a tuxedo for a private New Year's Eve party attended only by the two of them. Horrified to learn that she has fallen in love with him, he tries to let her down gently, but she slaps him and retreats to her room. Joe, thinking his time with her is over, escapes to a party at his friend, assistant director Artie Green's (Webb) house, where he meets Betty Schaefer again. While still unimpressed with most of his work, she believes a scene in one of his scripts has potential. Joe half-agrees to work on it with her, and calls the house on Sunset to tell Max he is leaving. However, when Max informs him that Norma has attempted suicide with Joe's razor blade, Joe leaves the party and returns to the mansion, where he apologizes to Norma and makes love to her.After a while, Norma considers her script complete, and sends it to Cecil B. DeMille at Paramount and waits for his answer. Not long afterwards, calls from Paramount asking for Norma begin to arrive. They come from an executive named Gordon Cole, and Norma petulantly refuses to speak to anyone other than DeMille himself. Eventually, she has Max drive her and Joe to the studio in her 1929 Isotta Fraschini Tipo 8A, a rare vintage luxury car. While DeMille entertains Norma, many of the older guards, technicians and extras on the set recognize her and welcome her back. Joe and Max, meanwhile, learn that Cole had called because the studio wants to rent her car and has no interest in her script (DeMille tells an assistant in private that the script is awful). Max insists that they hide these facts from her. He later confesses to Joe that he was once a respected film director who discovered Norma as a girl, and was also her first husband, and that he now remains as her servant because he cannot bear to leave her.While Norma undergoes a rigorous series of beauty treatments to prepare for her comeback, Joe has secretly begun to work with Betty on a screenplay. Though she is now engaged to Artie, she falls in love with him. Although he likes her, Joe is dismayed at the triangle in which he is now caught. When Norma discovers the script with Betty's name on it, she phones Betty and insinuates what sort of man Joe really is. Joe, hearing her, invites Betty to the mansion to see for herself. When she arrives, he coldly terminates their relationship by letting her believe that he is a gigolo and prefers to live off Norma. After Betty leaves the mansion in tears, Joe begins packing, having decided to return to Ohio. He bluntly informs Norma of the truththat there will be no comeback, her fan letters come from Max, and she is forgotten. He ignores Norma's threats to shoot herself, and in a fit of passion she shoots him as he leaves, leaving him dead in the pool.The scene returns to the opening. Still narrating, Joe expresses fear over how Norma will be unable to cope with the disgrace, and the discovery of how forgotten she truly is. By the time the police arrive, however, she has completely broken with reality and slipped into a delusional state of mind, thinking the news cameras are set up for a film shoot. To help the police coax her down the stairs, Max plays along with her hallucination that she is on the set of her new film. He verbally sets up the scene for her, and yells ""Action!""; Norma dramatically descends her grand staircase. Joe, in voiceover, remarks that life has decided to spare her the pain of that discovery, and that ""The dream she had clung to so desperately had enfolded her."" Norma makes a short speech at how happy she is to be back making a film, and delivers the film's most famous line: ""All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up."""

This was done in black and white and the absence of color does not hurt the performance of the King of Hollywood and his first lady Barbara Stanwick in her prime strong confident and very sexy with a wardrobe that would make any woman envious even today. I loved the shoe scene where she is conducting the papers business and trying on shoes at the same time. This is are great movie and well worth your time to see, racing and two Hollywood greats at their best."
tt0043067,"['Adventure', 'Family']","In the West Coast of England in 1765, a young boy called Jim Hawkins lives with his mother in a tiny country inn which they run. Captain William Bones, a sickly lodger and merchant marine, gives Hawkins a treasure map after being visited by two pirates, the second of whom (and whom also sports a large scar across his face) gives the captain a note marked with the black spot. That same night Bones is found dead at the inn, and Jim shows Squire Trelawney the map. Trelawney recognizes the map as belonging to the late buccaneer pirate Captain Flint and bankrolls a voyage to discover the pirate's lost treasure. Trelawney hires Captain Smollett and his ship, the Hispaniola, bringing along his friend Dr. Livesey as the ship's doctor and Jim as the cabin boy.Before departure Trelawney is taken in by Long John Silver, a one-legged inn-keeper and cook, who agrees to gather a crew. Silver strikes up a friendship with Jim and joins the expedition as the ship's cook. Smollett is concerned about the crew, especially when he reveals to Trelawney that the nature of their journey is common knowledge.At sea Jim overhears Silver and the crew's plan to mutiny, discovering that the seamen hired by Silver are Captain Flint's old crew of pirates (Silver worked as the cook aboard Flint's ship). Jim reveals the treachery to Smollett who asks Jim to stay friends with Silver to learn more. Upon reaching Treasure Island, Silver offers to tow the ship to a safer anchorage, using two of the ship's row boats. While the ship is being towed, one of Silver's men, Merry, leads a mutiny on the ship. Smollett, having been forewarned of the plot by Jim, is able to hold them off with the few men loyal to him and imprisons the mutineers below decks. Silver cuts the row boats from the Hispaniola and heads for shore with the rest of his men, taking Jim as a hostage. Smollett, Trelawney, and Livesey go ashore after them, leaving two guards on the ship.On the island, Jim escapes and meets Ben Gunn, a disheveled sailor marooned by Flint on the island five years ago. Gunn shows Jim the boat he's built, then leads him to Flint's stockade, where he meets up with Smollett and the others. Meanwhile, Merry escapes, takes the ship and raises the Jolly Roger skull and bones flag. Silver returns to the Hispaniola, arms his men with muskets and makes plans to take the stockade. Short of men, Silver attempts to parlay with Smollett, but when he is rebuffed, Silver calls his men to attack. The assault on the stockade fails with many of the pirates killed and wounded, but Silver shoots and wounds Smollett before retreating. Although seemingly protected by the stockade, Smollett surmises that, with the morning tide, Silver could move the Hispaniola into cannon range and level the fort.That evening, Jim takes Gunn's boat and cuts the Hispaniola's anchor rope. Jim also witnesses two of Long John Silver's men argue, leading to one of them killing the other. The pirate guard, Israel Hands, discovers Jim and chases him up into the ship's rigging to the crows nest. Hands injures Jim arm with a throwing knife but is killed by the boy's pistol who then falls overboard. Jim strikes the Jolly Roger and hoists the Union Jack.Slowed by his wound, it takes him all night to get back to the stockade, which is unguarded. Inside, Jim searches for the doctor to tend his wound, but the man asleep under Livesey's coat is Long John Silver, which his men have taken the stockade. Jim faints on the spot. Silver finds the treasure map on him as his men wake up. Merry wants Jim dead, but Silver states he wants to trade him for the map, which his men believe is with Smollett. The men go outside to vote, pirate-style, while Silver tends to Jim and stitches up his wound. From the stockade's lookout, Silver sees that the ship's aground, flying the Union Jack.The men give Silver the black spot, but he objects. Rattled, they let him bargain with Livesey for the map. Silver returns with Jim, flaunting the map. Long John Silver leads his men through the forest and fields using the map to locate the hidden place to the treasure. When they get to the site and begin digging, the pirates are overjoyed until they find out that the treasure (700,000 pounds sterling) isn't there. The pirates turn on Silver, who manages to kill three of them before Smollett's men appear to kill the rest. Greeting Silver, Gunn reveals that he's the one who dug up Flint's treasure years earlier and has stashed it in a cave.After Gunn shows the treasure composed of gold and silver coins in several chests, Captain Smollett still wants Silver taken back for trial in England. Jim Hawkins, Squire Trelawney and two other loyal sailors take Silver to the Hispaniola aboard a rowboat loaded with a chest of treasure. Silver snatches Jim's pistol and forces Trelawney and the others out of the boat. He wants Hawkins to steer while he rows, but Jim beaches them instead. Silver orders Hawkins to push him off, but Jim refuses and Silver threatens to shoot him. Silver is unable to carry out his threat and drops the pistol, attempting to push the boat off himself. Seeing Silver struggle (and feeling that he owes Silver for saving his life), Jim helps him push off, waving a hesitant farewell as Silver rows away into the open ocean."

The two Christian missionaries are in a remote African village with grass huts and a little wooden church, which is located somewhere deep in a German African colony during WWI near the Ulanga River. The German war machine appears to brutally start burning the little straw hut village, killing the native women and children while kidnapping the African men, and just as quickly the German terror vanishes. When the smoke clears from the burning village, all is in ruin. The meek and fragile Rev. Samuel Sayer is so distraught by what he has just witnessed he kills himself. Rose is left all alone to fend for herself;she is lost in despair. There is no safety here, and the German threat is all around. There is no way out except to travel south down the dangerous and unforgiving Ulanga River. The river leads to Lake Victoria and possible freedom. Except for the last danger, which is the Louisa - a German gunship that patrols the Tanganyika shore of the lake up to the southern mouth of the river. The Ulanga is filled with dangers like animals that can eat you, rocks and white water rapids that can smash and sink a boat. It has only been successfully navigated once by a map maker named Spangler a hundred years ago and no one since has repeated the feat.Rose is straggling about the burnt village in shock and despair from her brother's suicide when a Mr. Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) shows up out of nowhere to save her. This scruffy old gin-swigging rummy is a boat captain who is unshaven and crusty. Mr. Allnut is there to deliver mail and supplies to the village. Mr. Allnut travels up and down the northern part of the Ulanga on a rusty old 12-foot boat called the African Queen. The boat barely runs, powered by a small antique steam engine on its last legs kept together and encouraged to run with a few well placed kicks and bangs from a hammer by Mr. Allnut. Mr. Allnut buries Rev. Sayer and takes Rose to the African Queen for safety before the Germans come back. While on the African Queen Rose attempts to convince Mr. Allnut they should go south down the Ulanga and sink the Louisa. Mr. Allnut thinks the spinster is a crazy old maid and tells her so. And Rose thinks Mr. Allnut is washed-up rummy good for nothing coward unfit to be a captain. As impossible as it may seem Mr. Allnut decides to follow her suggestion because its the only way to avoid the Germans, and probably the only way to shut Rose up and stop her from nagging on and on about her crazy plan to fight the German navy.During the first few days aboard the African Queen navigating the Ulanga they annoy each other to the point of being disgusted. Rose reads her bible while Mr. Allnut drinks rum from a generous supply he has on board until he passes out every day. Rose decides to dump all of Mr. Allnuts bottles of gin into the river one morning while Mr. Allnut is still passed out. When Mr. Allnut awakes, he is emotionally destroyed by the thought of no more booze. How could you, Miss? Mr. Allnut asks over and over as the African Queen smokes and tugs along the Ulanga. Rose decides to stop talking to Mr. Allnut and gives him the silent treatment until he gives in to her plan to sink the Louisa. Mr. Allnut continues to talk to Rose even though Rose refuses to acknowledge his existence on the little boat. Mr. Allnut pretends he doesn't care even though the silence is slowing killing him. It is apparent they cannot stand each others company. Finally Mr. Allnut can't take the silence anymore and agrees to Rose's impossible plan to sink the Louisa using home made torpedoes made by Mr. Allnut. Mr Allnut says he can make them from the supplies on the boat - explosives and two gas canisters used for welding.As the two strangers sail down Ulanga River like great map makers before them and determined to sink the Louisa, Rose is impressed by Mr. Allnut's abilities and admires his seamanship when they hit big white water and how he skillfully navigates past the dangerous rocks. They ride into some really rough white water that causes Rose to feel aroused by the thrill of the ride. Not understanding the experience she compares it to a thrilling sermon delivered by her brother when the holy ghost consumed him. The spiritual excitement overcomes her as she describes her excitement to Mr. Allnut. Rose and Mr. Allnut survive a second and more dangerous set of white water rapids, along with extra dangers from African guerrillas shooting at them from the banks of the river hoping to kill them and capture the African Queen. When they realize they have survived certain death again they start hugging and kissing. After they kiss, they realize they are in love. It's implied they are lovers that afternoon after much flirting and a quick nap. However, their troubles are not over as the African Queen breaks down and they work as a team to fix it. Mr. Allnut shaves, baths and listens to Rose read the good book. They make tea and find they adore each others company. They call each other dear and tell each other sweet nothings.Nevertheless there is still more danger ahead. The river disappears, the water is shallow, and Mr. Allnut is forced to get into the mucky river and pull the African Queen by hand to higher water. Blood sucking leeches, mosquitoes, and dangerous animals torment the couple's efforts. The African Queen comes to a complete stop, stuck dead in mucky swamp water and high weeds covering any sight of land or water ways. They are lost in the weeds and can't see anything. They are disheartened and beaten and accept their doomed fate as they hold each other in exhaustion waiting to die. Passed out on the African Queen they lie there defeated. When it begins to rain and the river rises, the African Queen becomes unstuck and floats down the river only a few hundred feet from high water and the mouth of the Ulanga River. The Ulanga River is pouring into Lake Victoria and they see the Louisa gunship for the first time as it makes a routine patrol..The two lovers are now alive again! With new hope and determination they are convinced they can now sink the Louisa. They wait in the banks of the Ulanga out of sight of the Louisa until it comes back on its routine patrol. They have fixed and fastened two homemade torpedoes to the insides of the African Queen. By cutting circle holes above the water line they can stick the tips of the torpedoes through the holes which act as battering rams that will compress on collision and ignite the explosives to explode the gas canisters when they crash into the Louisa at full speed ahead. Rose and Mr. Allnut lovingly argue about who will stay ashore while the other steers the boat into the Louisa. The hero will jump just before the collision and explosion that will sink the Louisa on impact. They both decide they would not want to live without the other so they will do it together. Rose and Mr. Allnut wait until the Louisa comes back on its patrol routine that evening and begin to plan to ram the Louisa. Building steam as the weather starts to change and the waves grow higher. The Louisa is not expecting the African Queen to even be there let alone capable of exploding and sinking the Louisa. As they steam towards the Louisa the lake begins to become rough, a rain storm squalls, and the seas begin filling the boat with water. A rogue wave turns the African Queen upside over tossing Rose and Mr. Allnut into the lake. The two are separated by another huge wave and disappear. Have they drowned? Alas, the Louisa is not sunk and the African Queen appears to be gone with the two star-crossed lovers.The sun appears after the storm and we see Mr. Allnut is alive. He was rescued and captured by the Germans. Mr. Allnut is now standing on the Louisa's deck in the captain's office. He is being interrogated by the Louisa's captain (Peter Bull). The captain is determined to have Mr. Allnut answer his questions. The German captain always ends each question with the threat of death and hanging to Mr. Allnut, who is depressed and despondent. Mr. Allnut answers each question and threat of death with a hopeless sigh of, who cares! Because Mr. Allnut believes his Rose has drowned. Mr. Allnut is relieved by the thought of hanging rather than live without his Rose. Suddenly he hears Rose's voice coming from a life boat that has rescued her. Mr. Allnut, thrilled that Rose is alive, decides to deny he knows her in hopes of saving her from his fated hanging by the Germans. But the very English Rose not only argues with the captain but brags how she and Charlie and the African Queen sailed down the Ulanga, and how Charlie made homemade torpedoes, and how they came within feet of sinking the Louisa by themselves and would have, but the storm saved the Louisa from their doom when the weather caused the African Queen to sink and a wave tossed them into the water. The Louisa's captain thinking them both crazy decides to hang them both. On the deck of the Louisa, Rose and Charlie stand holding hands deeply in love, happy about dying together. Standing there with the hangman's rope around their necks Charlie asks the Louisa's captain to marry them as his last request before hanging. Charlie says he really doesn't care about getting married but it would mean a lot to the Mrs. A teary-eyed Rose is thrilled by the suggestion. The Louisa's captain thinks they are both mad but reluctantly agrees to marry them. The two are so happy to be married that they don't care they are going to be hung. Just as he pronounces them man and wife the Louisa explodes. The sunken African Queen has been hit by the Louisa. Rose and Charlie find themselves swimming and the Louisa is gone. They did it. A wood plank with the name African Queen floats by and the two grab it as they swim to apparent safety. Swimming away, the two sing merrily, ""There was an old fisherman..."""

Alice's sister scolds her, gently but firmly, for her lack of attention. At that moment, Alice dreams of living in a world of nonsense (""A World of My Own"", as she explains and sings to her little kitten Dinah). Just then, Alice sees a White Rabbit (Bill Thompson) wearing a waistcoat and carrying a large pocket watch. She and Dinah follow him into a rabbit hole, where Alice suddenly falls down into a deep well, leaving Dinah behind.At the bottom, she follows the Rabbit into a large chamber-like hall, but he escapes through a tiny door. The Doorknob (Joseph Kearns) suggests Alice drink from a bottle marked ""Drink me."" The contents shrink her to a tiny fraction of her original size. The door is locked, and the key appears on the table, which she can not reach. The Doorknob directs her to a cookie marked ""Eat me."" The cookie makes her grow so large that her head hits the ceiling. She begins to cry; her massive tears flood the room. The Doorknob points out that the ""Drink me"" bottle still has some fluid left inside, so she finishes the last drop. She becomes so small that she drops inside the bottle. Both she and the bottle drift through the doorknob's keyhole mouth and out to a sea made from Alice's tears.On shore, a Dodo bird (Thompson) leads a group of animals in a futile caucus-race to get dry. Alice meets Tweedledum and Tweedledee (J. Pat O'Malley), two fat twin brothers who recite ""The Walrus and the Carpenter"", in a sequence that first appeared in Through the Looking-Glass. After sneaking away to the White Rabbit's house, Alice is at first mistaken by him for his maidservant; and then grows to such a large size that she gets stuck inside the house. The Dodo tries to help by first sending Bill the Lizard Chimney Sweep down the chimney, and then setting the house on fire; but Alice eats a carrot from the garden and shrinks down to three inches. Alice sings ""All in the Golden Afternoon"" with a garden of talking flowers, who originally appeared in Chapter 3 of Through the Looking-GlassAlice chases after the Rabbit again, and in another example of a vignette borrowed from Through the Looking-Glass, she finds herself in a garden of talking flowers and strange insects.

She engages a hookah-smoking caterpillar who turns into a butterfly, though not before giving her cryptic advice about the mushroom she is sitting on. Alice breaks off two pieces and nibbles them alternately (first growing very large and unintentionally aggravating a Nesting Mother Bird (Queenie Leonard), who accuses Alice of being a ""serpent"", then shrinking very small).

She is lost and despondent among the strange creatures (See Below) of the Tulgey Wood, until the Cheshire Cat reappears and shows her a short-cut out of the forest and into the garden of the Queen (and King) of Hearts.In the hedge maze garden, Alice meets some playing cards painting white roses red. The White Rabbit heralds the arrival of the bellicose Queen of Hearts (Verna Felton), the diminutive King (Dink Trout), and a card army.

The second is the formidable and much-disliked Classics Master, Mr Andrew Crocker-Harris (Michael Redgrave). He is being forced into an early retirement due to ill health.After the morning prayers, the boys of the Lower-Fifth have their last Classics lesson with Crocker-Harris.

He takes his medicines and goes upstairs to his room.Frank is aghast at Millie's cruelty. He breaks up with her right then. Upstairs, Frank tries to comfort Crocker-Harris but finds that the latter has once again withdrawn into his cold shell.

Taplow sees the copy of Crocker-Harris's translation of the Agamemnon on his desk and takes it away with him to read.It is the last assembly of the term. Crocker-Harris tells Frobisher that he has changed his mind about letting Fletcher speak last: he will address the assembly after Fletcher, as is his prerogative as a senior. When it is Crocker-Harris's turn to speak, the students are at first ready for a dry speech filled with Latinisms. However, Crocker-Harris departs from his prepared speech and frankly tells the students that he has failed as a teacher. He apologises for his shortcomings. The students are at first taken aback and then burst into spontaneous applause.After the assembly, Taplow comes up to meet Crocker-Harris for a final time. He gives him back the copy of the Agamemnon that he had taken from Crocker-Harris's desk and says that it is a brilliant translation. Crocker-Harris is heartened by his appreciation. Before Taplow leaves, Crocker-Harris obliquely lets him know that he has been promoted to the Upper-Fifth."
tt0043371,"['Comedy', 'Western']","Although children throughout America are mesmerized by television broadcasts of old Western movies starring singing cowboy ""Smoky"" Callaway, Mike Frey and Deborah Patterson, partners in the advertising firm that resurrected the films, are frustrated, because Smoky, a notorious alcoholic and womanizer, disappeared ten years ago. Their sponsor, Tom Lorrison, demands to see Smoky to decide if he wants to finance some new pictures for television, so Mike sends Georgie Markham, Smoky's last agent, to look for the missing star.After weeks of Georgie following fruitless leads from California to Mexico, Mike and Debbie are about to admit defeat when they receive a letter from ""Stretch"" Barnes, a Colorado cowhand who chastises them for televising movies of a man who looks just like Smoky Callaway. Seeing the photo Stretch has sent as proof of the uncanny resemblance, Mike decides to go to Colorado and lure Stretch to Hollywood. Mike and Debbie are impressed with the naive but rugged Stretch and convince him to impersonate Smoky by telling him that Smoky has died and that millions of children who idolize him would be devastated. The money also appeals to the frugal Stretch, who dreams of owning a ranch.Unknown to Mike, Georgie has just located the real Smoky in a South American dive and shanghaied him aboard a slow boat to Los Angeles. When the unsophisticated Stretch arrives at the Beverly Hills Hotel, Debbie and Mike prepare him to meet Lorrison and his wife at the Mocambo nightclub. Stretch fails to recognize movie stars such as Elizabeth Taylor and Clark Gable, and is shocked when Mrs. Lorrison reveals that she met a drunken Smoky years ago, but Mike convinces Lorrison that ""Smoky"" no longer drinks and he agrees to finance a screen test. Stretch is not a good actor and members of the crew and cast, thinking that he is Smoky, put him through his paces for not remembering them. The director and Lorrison like the innocence he brings to the role, though, and predict success.Back in his room, Stretch, who declined to watch the test, is packing to leave, but Mike convinces him it is his duty to ""the children"" and urges him to make a personal appearance at a children's hospital. The children love the affable Stretch, and Mike arranges for him to take a nationwide tour as Smoky. While Mike works on a merchandising and advertising campaign, Stretch begins to enjoy his role as Smoky and falls in love with Debbie, who is touring with him. She gently refuses his proposal, saying that she is merely fond of him, but he gives her a ring-box and asks her to keep it in case she decides to wear the ring. Debbie makes a call to Mike, begging him to change places with her, but he quickly gets off the telephone when Georgie and the real Smoky walk into his office.While Stretch and Debbie are in New York, he is deeply affected when a woman lambastes him for not using his money to help the real children who need him, those who are impoverished or ill. Unaware that Debbie has just learned that the real Smoky intends to take back his identity, Stretch goes to an attorney to set up the Smoky Callaway Foundation for disadvantaged children, intending it to receive all but a small portion of ""Smoky's"" size-able earnings. When Debbie learns about his selflessness, she is touched and cannot bring herself to tell him that legally Smoky is entitled to all of the money.As she and Stretch travel back to Los Angeles, a reluctant Mike pays to send Smoky to a training camp to get him in shape and to quick drinking. However, someone is sneaking liquor to Smoky, and as a result, he is not sound or sober enough to appear at a contract-signing ceremony. Mike and Debbie continue to keep Stretch in the dark while he signs Smoky's contract.That night, Lorrison takes Debbie, Mike and Stretch to a nightclub for dinner. There, Mike gets a call from Georgie saying that Smoky has run away and is heading to Hollywood. While Stretch is in the men's room, Mike sees the intoxicated Smoky at the bar and tries to get him to leave.A few minutes later, Stretch and Smoky finally meet face-to-face for the first time in the parking lot and an angry Stretch leaves after realizing that he has been duped. Even the remorseful Debbie cannot get Stretch to talk to her. When one of Stretch's lawyers comes to the hotel and confirms that if he signs the foundation papers, no one can use the money for anything but the intended purpose, Stretch calls Mike to say that he will appear at a charity event at the Coliseum for the offered $5,000, and secretly plans to reveal the truth. Before Stretch leaves the hotel, Smoky comes to his room and the two get into a fistfight. When Mike arrives, he gets into the scuffle and he and Smoky are both knocked unconscious by Stretch. When Smoky awakens, he has had enough of Hollywood and decides to return to South America.At the Coliseum, Debbie convinces Stretch that the children really need him and shows him that she is now wearing the ring. Stretch then rides onto the field and delights the audience as Mike wishes Debbie well."
tt0043456,"['Drama', 'SciFi']","An extraterrestrial flying saucer is tracked streaking about the Earth until it gently lands on the President's Park Ellipse in Washington, D.C. Klaatu (Michael Rennie) emerges, announcing that he has come from outer space on a goodwill mission. Upon opening a small, suspicious-looking device, he is wounded by a nervous soldier and the device is destroyed. In response, Gort, a large humanoid robot emerges from the ship and disintegrates all weapons present with a ray emanating from his head, without harming the soldiers. Klaatu orders him to stop and explains that the ruined object was a viewing device, a gift for the President.Klaatu is taken to an army hospital, where he is found to be physically human-like, but stuns the doctors with the quickness of his healing. Meanwhile the military attempts to enter Klaatu's ship, but finds it impregnable. Gort stands by, mute and unmoving.Klaatu reveals to the President's secretary, Harley (Frank Conroy), that he bears a message so momentous and urgent that it can and must be revealed to all the world's leaders simultaneously. However Harley tells him that it would be impossible to get the squabbling world leaders to agree to meet. Klaatu wants to get to know the ordinary people. Harley forbids it and leaves Klaatu locked up under guard.Klaatu escapes and lodges at a boarding house, assuming the alias ""Mr. Carpenter"". Among the residents are Helen Benson (Patricia Neal), a World War II widow, and her son Bobby (Billy Gray). At breakfast the next morning, during alarming radio reports, Klaatu takes in the unknowing fellow boarders' suspicions and speculations about the purpose of the alien's visit.While Helen and her boyfriend Tom Stephens (Hugh Marlowe) go on a day trip, Klaatu babysits Bobby. The boy takes Klaatu on a tour of the city, including a visit to his father's grave in Arlington National Cemetery, where Klaatu is dismayed to learn that most of those buried there were killed in wars. The two visit the heavily guarded spaceship and the Lincoln Memorial. Klaatu, impressed by the Gettysburg Address inscription, queries Bobby for the greatest person living in the world. Bobby suggests a leading American scientist, Professor Jacob Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe), who lives in Washington, D.C. Bobby takes Klaatu to Barnhardt's home, but the professor is absent. Klaatu enters and adds a key mathematical equation to an advanced problem on the professor's blackboard, and then leaves his contact information with the suspicious housekeeper.Later, government agents escort Klaatu to see Barnhardt. Klaatu introduces himself and warns the professor that the people of the other planets have become concerned for their own safety after human beings developed atomic power. Klaatu declares that if his message goes unheeded, ""Planet Earth will be eliminated."" Barnhardt agrees to arrange a meeting of scientists at Klaatu's ship and suggests that Klaatu give a demonstration of his power. Klaatu returns to his spaceship the next evening to implement the idea, unaware that Bobby has followed him.Bobby tells the unbelieving Helen and Tom what has transpired, but not until Tom finds a diamond on the floor of Klaatu's room do they begin to accept his story. When Tom takes the diamond for appraisal, the jeweler informs him it is unlike any other on Earth.Klaatu finds Helen at her workplace. She leads him to an unoccupied elevator which mysteriously stops at noon, trapping them together. Klaatu admits he is responsible, tells Helen his true identity, and asks for her help. A montage sequence shows that Klaatu has neutralized all electric power everywhere around the planet except in situations that would compromise human safety, such as hospitals and airplanes.After the thirty-minute blackout ends, the manhunt for Klaatu intensifies and Tom informs authorities of his suspicions. Helen is very upset by Tom's betrayal of Klaatu and breaks off their relationship. Helen and Klaatu take a taxi to Barnhardt's home; en route, Klaatu instructs Helen that, should anything happen to him, she must tell Gort ""Klaatu barada nikto"". When they are spotted, Klaatu is shot by military personnel. Helen heads to the spaceship. Gort awakens and kills two guards before Helen can relay Klaatu's message. Gort gently deposits her in the spaceship, then goes to fetch Klaatu's corpse. Gort then revives Klaatu while the amazed Helen watches on. Klaatu explains that his revival is only temporary; even with their advanced technology, they cannot truly overcome death.
Klaatu steps out of the spaceship and addresses the assembled scientists, explaining that humanity's penchant for violence and first steps into space have caused concern among other inhabitants of the universe who have created and empowered a race of robot enforcers including Gort to deter such aggression. He warns that if the people of Earth threaten to extend their violence into space, the robots will destroy Earth, adding, ""The decision rests with you."" He enters the spaceship and departs.The original story ends slightly differently. After helping the robot to revive Klaatu, a newsman asks it to be sure to tell its masters that Klaatu's death was an unfortunate accident. The robot responds, ""You are mistaken. I am the master."""
tt0043461,"['Biography', 'Drama', 'War']","The movie opens in November 1941 with a British submarine-launched commando raid on the shores of Libya. The target of the raid is General Erwin Rommel of the German Afrika Korps, who is enjoying considerable success against British troops in North Africa. The daring raid produces plenty of casualties but misses Rommel. Rommel is gaining legendary status with his British enemies.A captured British Lieutenant Colonel, Desmond Young, soon has a chance encounter with the celebrated Rommel in the midst of a desert artillery barrage. Rommel treats Young with respect and chivalry, inspiring the British officer after the war to investigate the life and mysterious death of the great general.Rommel's story is told in retrospect, beginning with the defeat of German forces at El Alamein in late 1942. Rommel, by now a Field Marshal, had been away from the front on medical leave, but he is forced to return in an attempt to stem the British tide. Rommel fights gallantly but becomes increasingly disenchanted with Hitler's interference and maniacal insistence on victory or death.Shortly before the total defeat of German forces in North Africa in the spring of 1943, Rommel is again invalided back to Germany. In the hospital, Rommel is visited by his wife Lucie (Jessica Tandy), his son Manfred, and Dr. Karl Strolin (Cedric Hardwicke), the Lord Mayor of Stuttgart and an early conspirator against Hitler. Strolin's presence arouses the suspicion of the SS and Gestapo. Rommel confides to Strolin that Hitler has accused him of cowardice and hinted at having him shot, and that Hitler had callously abandoned his beloved Afrika Korps. He further confides that Hitler no longer believes victory is possible, and that he only fights on because the Allies would never make peace with him. That can only mean that Germany and her people will be forced to fight to the death. Strolin provides Rommel with a dire warning about Hitler's unstable and vindictive nature.Rommel returns to active duty in November 1943, overseeing the defensive preparations for the expected Allied invasion in the West. Rommel works tirelessly to improve the woefully weak German fortifications. Reporting back to Field Marshal von Rundstedt (Leo G. Carroll), Rommel learns that Hitler himself is directing most aspects of the war. Von Rundstedt further warns Rommel that he will be under constant suspicion from Berlin.While Rommel is home on leave in February 1944, Dr. Strolin makes another attempt to enlist him in the growing conspiracy against Hitler. Rommel is offended and horrified at the thought of a military coup, and the discussion becomes heated. Strolin leaves without a commitment.Rommel soon returns to France and continues his defensive preparations. When D-Day arrives and the Allies gradually manage to expand their beachheads, Rommel frets over misallocated troops while von Rundstedt ridicules Hitler and his arbitrary decisions that tie their hands. Seeing an opening, Rommel tries to enlist von Rundstedt in the conspiracy to remove Hitler. But Rundstedt begs off, saying that while he agrees with them, he is too old to revolt. Rommel requests a final meeting with Hitler before firmly committing to his overthrow. The meeting is a disaster; Hitler blasts Rommel as a defeatist and promises miracle weapons that will soon turn the tide in Germany's favor.Rommel now resolves to join the other conspirators, remove Hitler, and sue for an honorable peace. But then, his staff car is caught on an open road by Allied fighter planes and badly strafed. Rommel is seriously injured. While he is recuperating in a French hospital, the failed July 20, 1944 assassination attempt against Hitler takes place.Three months after the assassination attempt, General Keitel phones Rommel, who is still convalescing at home. Keitel supposedly wants to inquire about Rommel's health and readiness for another command. When Rommel explains that it will be another few weeks before he is ready, Keitel offers to send someone down from Berlin to discuss a future command with him. The next day, General Wilhelm Burgdorf and another officer arrive at Rommel's home. Ominously, a truckload of armed soldiers waits on the main road.Rommel and the two officers retire to a private room to talk. Rommel is suddenly presented with a list of treason charges against him, stemming from the bomb plot. Rommel initially chooses to stand trial and address the charges, but it soon becomes apparent that he will not get the chance. Burgdorf makes it plain that Rommel's family will be in jeopardy should he not accept the only real option left to him- a poison capsule. In return, his family will be taken care of and Rommel will be publicly hailed as a national hero who succumbed to his war wounds. This deception will serve to prevent embarrassment for Adolf Hitler.Rommel bids a sad farewell to Lucie, his son Manfred, and his loyal aide Aldinger (Richard Boone). He then climbs into a staff car with the officers for a short and final ride. The film ends with a heartfelt tribute from Winston Churchill, who honored Rommel as a worthy adversary and decent man who came to hate Naziism."

On the way Stanley suggests that he and Ellie take a vacation, perhaps to Hawaii. Ellie is rather vague and says they should wait to hear Kay and Buckley's news. When they arrive at the Dunstan apartment, Buckley's parents Herbert and Doris are already there. The Dunstans announce that they are expecting a baby in November. Everyone is thrilled except Stanley. He feels that being a grandfather will mean that he is an old man. Back home, Ellie excitedly telephones her friends. Kay's younger brothers Ben and Tommy are told but Stanley warns then not to spread it around. The next day, Stanley goes to the gym for a complete workout. He is determined to get back into shape. But the following morning he is so stiff and sore that he can't get out of bed. Ellie throws Kay a baby shower, which is well attended. Stanley comes home and sees that Buckley is trapped in a gaggle of women, all thrusting shower gifts in his face. Before he can escape, Ellie summons him to the kitchen. She thinks they should ask Kay and Buckley to live with them. Their little apartment isn't big enough for a baby. Stanley listens to her plans but refuses to consider the idea. He has no desire to relive round-the-clock feedings, measles, and colic. Just then the senior Dunstans arrive. Herbert and Doris had the same idea as Ellie only more elaborate. They offer Kay and Buckley their very own wing in their mansion. Ellie flees to the kitchen before she can burst into tears. She reminds Stanley that now was the time Kay would need her the most. She had planned to help with the baby clothes and nursery. In exasperation, Stanley tells her to go on and have Kay and Buckley move in. But she says it is too late, that they will accept Herbert's offer and she will never get to see the baby. Kay and Buckley have made their own plans, however, and to their parents' surprise announce that they have bought a house. Ellie eagerly offers to help decorate and her earlier upset is forgotten.In the following months, both sets of grandparents-to-be manage to interfere. There is a discussion of baby names, with the grandparents arguing over which ones are suitable and ignoring what Kay and Buckley like. No one approves of the young couple's obstetrician at first, but after the prospective grandparents all pay him a visit, they concede that he seems to know what he's doing. Stanley and Herbert try to outdo each other when it comes to buying gifts for the baby. Stanley buys what resembles a window air-conditioner but is really an air filter, eliminating dust and pollen. Herbert furnishes the nursery and puts up a Harvard pennant, which angers Stanley because he himself attended Dartmouth. Late one night, Stanley is awakened by the telephone. It is Buckley looking for Kay. They had a fight and she walked out on him. Without waking Ellie, Stanley gets dressed and drives to his daughter's home. Buckley is reluctant to discuss what the fight was about but eventually admits that Kay accused him of having an affair. He assures Stanley that nothing could be further from the truth. He was working late to earn extra money. When Kay called him at the office, he wasn't there because he had stepped out for coffee.

Another late night phone call lets them know the baby is on the way. They quickly dress and Ellie goes to get the car. Stanley wants to drive but she says there isn't time to switch places. She drives at a high speed, dodges oncoming traffic, and narrowly escapes getting hit by a train. At the hospital, she gets out while Stanley parks the car.

Ellie has a hard time getting the news out of Stanley because he can't stay awake. When Kay and the still unnamed baby come home from the hospital, he and Stanley don't hit it off. Every time Stanley tries to hold him, he cries. A disgusted Stanley announces that he wants nothing more to do with the baby.

Billy decides to go talk with the coach of the Los Angeles team and the coach agrees to sign him on if Billy promises to take it easy and not do anything to aggravate the knee until the next season. Billy then signs a four year contract for about $50,000.About the same time, Billy is approached by the head of the chemistry department at Baltimore State University (a school Billy once referred to as jerkwater). The professor offers Billy a job teaching introductory chemistry until it was time for him to start playing ball again. Billy, who was an honors student in chemistry, accepts the job, even if it was a jerkwater school in his opinion.The third game of the three-game series with the Celtics was coming up. Both teams had won one game each. Billy is scheduled to teach a class the night of the game, but when he learns half the university is going to be at the game, he decides he would like to go too, but he wants to go as a player. He goes to see Abe Saperstein and asks if he can suit up and sit on the bench. Abe says ok, without much discussion, and no argument. However, Billy doesnt simply sit on the bench, he starts.The game is back and forth, but Billy plays well and is in for the entire game. Again, it comes down to the last shot and its Billys shot again. This time the shot goes in, but his knee collapses again. Billy figures that doesn't matter, as everyones thrilled with the win and Billy has time to rest and heal up before the next season, which will be with the Globetrotters and not the L.A. team, as he automatically forfeited that contract by playing with the Globetrotters again."

He wants to return to the U.S. and has a nefarious plan to do so.Don Milner (Robert Mitchum), a professional gambler of the same height, build, and coloring as Ferraro, goes to home after having a glass of milk at a bar. He has just spent 30 days in jail in Palm Springs. Three thugs are playing cards in his room. They claim he's made a bet and has to pay off. He informs them he was in jail at the time, but they beat him up anyway. One of the thugs makes a phone call and the man he's calling reminds him not to mess up Milner's face.The person the thug was calling turns out to be Orley Chester, an acquaintance of Milner's. Orley and another man offer to pay Milner a total of $50,000 to go to Mexico, making it clear he has no choice. He is not told why he's being sent there. They start with a stake of $5000. He heads to a small airfield. As he waits for his chili and beans, he hears Lenore Brent (Jane Russell) singing ""San Berdoo"" (San Bernardino) with a guitarist and pianist in a small backroom. He buys her a bottle of champagne, but claiming to be a spoiled little rich girl, she gets up to go to her chartered plane before he can open it. His plane arrives to take him to Morro's Lodge, a ritzy resort in Mexico. She's seated on the plane.Jos√© Morro (Philip Van Zandt) greets him in the lodge. Milner offers a $1000 retainer for information, especially about Liz. Meanwhile, nearby, a hired musician greets Lenore as ""Liz""; she responds ""wrong name"" and walks away. Myron Winton (Jim Backus) starts a conversation with Milner. They see a pretty young blonde who looks frightened. Milner speaks with the blonde offering his help, but she claims she's all right and leaves. Lenore asks him to dance but he puts her off. He runs into Mark Cardigan (Vincent Price), an actor famous for his swashbuckling films, who is also an avid hunter.Milner see Martin Krafft (John Mylong), a supposed writer Cardigan has pointed out, who spends the day playing chess by himself. Krafft is talking secretly with Mr. Thompson (Charles McGraw), a man Milner didn't know before he called Morro get some information on him. Milner threatens Krafft to find out what's going on, but Krafft says he knows no more than Milner. Thompson comes in with a gun, but Milner stays cool, asking about the mystery. Thompson gives him $10,000 but tells him only that he was chosen because he'd never been in trouble with the Feds.Thompson contacts Ferraro on the radio, telling him Milner is getting antsy and might leave. Ferraro, who has been delayed by inclement weather, orders Thompson to keep Milner at the resort.A movie is being shown that night at the lodge, and Cardigan watches the film in which he is starring. Afterward, he plays the crowd, luxuriating in the compliments.In the midst of a burgeoning hurricane, a young man, daringly flies his small plane into the lodge. As they watch the landing, Milner and Lenore kiss. The next day, the newcomer, who appears to be drunk, is trying to do cartwheels for the young blonde who is worried because her newlywed husband has lost all their money to Winton.Lenore meets her old friend, the musician, and apologizes for snubbing him the day before. He knew her when she as Liz Barnes, a ""nice kid"" singing with a USO tour of Europe. She says ""Liz"" went to Europe and never came back. It becomes clear she has been faking her wealth. She's trying to seduce Cardigan, who is married, but planning a divorce, for his money. The next day, she and Milner decide to forget the kiss. Mrs. Cardigan suddenly arrives and goes straight up to Lenore commenting on how many women her husband meets. She hasn't told Cardigan she was coming. Cardigan's agent, Hobson, who has accompanied Mrs. Cardigan, demands he come back to the States and be reconciled with his wife so that he will get more film contracts. Cardigan reminds them both that his wife is the one who wanted the divorce.The ""drunk""turns out to be Lusk, a Federal agent who wants Milner's cooperation. He's chasing Ferraro. He tells Milner that Krafft is a plastic surgeon who has been deported, implying that Ferraro plans to get surgery and take Milner's identity. Milner pretends he doesn't get the message and returns to his bungalow. Lenore is there. They kiss again. To protect her, he makes sure Thompson isn't watching as she leaves the bungalow.Thompson catches Lusk snooping. Lusk overhears a radio communiqu√©, tells Thompson what he suspects, then takes him by surprise. They fight. Milner and Lenore find Lusk's body on the beach. He tries to convince her to leave, but she resists.When he returns to his bungalow, alone, he is met by two of Ferraro's men. Surprising them, he pulls a gun but there's a third man behind him. Lenore, realizing he's in trouble, tries to bring him a gun, but he says ""take it to Cardigan."" Cardigan takes the gun and his hunting rifle and goes to the beach to rescue Milner, who has gotten away from the men who are taking him by force to Ferraro's yacht. After he overturns the small boat they were using, he swims to shore. He and Cardigan consult; Cardigan keeps the thugs busy with rifle fire while Milner goes to get Ferraro off the yacht. When he gets there he is chased by three thugs. Cornered, he shoots two steam pipes, that burn and blind the thugs, and crawls away, but they capture him.Back on the shore, the three thugs on land spread out, hoping to surround Cardigan, who uses his skills to shoot one of them, then the second. He taunts the last one, giving himself time to set up a trap. He shoots and captures the final one.On the ship, two thugs hold Milner while Ferraro and the others beat him. He periodically breaks away and hits them, but they overpower him, tie him to a mast and flog him with a leather belt. It becomes clear that Ferraro is insane. He has Milner tossed into the lower part of the ship where the steam pipes are broken. Ferraro tries to decide what to do. Krafft wants to drug Milner, but Ferraro crazily keeps banging Milner's head on a wooden beam, trying to wake him up. But he is interrupted before he can shoot. He agrees to Krafft's injection.Cardigan conscripts tourists and Mexican police to rescue Milner, treating it like a big adventure, spouting bits from films and plays. In a comic moment, the police warn him that the boat is too full but he stands at aft as the boat sinks. They find a bigger boat and set off. Cardigan shoots out the floodlight on the yacht so Ferraro's men turn all the lights out, so nobody becomes a target. Krafft can't do the injection in the dark. Cardigan boards the ship and the shooting begins. Milner gets away from Krafft. Cardigan sights Ferraro and follows him, but as Cardigan is distracted, getting the drop on the men who are preparing a getaway boat, Ferraro tries to sneak up on Cardigan. Milner sneaks up on Ferraro but hasn't yet finished reloading his gun. After a chase, Milner shoots Ferraro.Back on land, Cardigan's wife fusses over him, bandaging his wounds as he regales the press with his victorious adventure. In the final scene, Lenore admits to Milner that her father is a barber, not a millionaire, and they kiss."

tt0043686,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'War']","Two children, who look a lot like Michel and Paulette, the heros of the film, are seated on the bank of a lake, in the middle of a beautiful and rich park. The children themselves, very smartly dressed, seem to be from a rich family. The little boy has a big book from which he reads a story to the little girl. This story is the very beginning of the story told in the film. (This scene is to be found only in some earlier versions of the film)June 1940. The film shows us some very realistic scenes of the French ¬´exode¬ª. During the spring of 1940, several millions of French people, from the North of France, and mostly from the Paris area, being afraid of the German army, were running away southward. The film shows us a road and a bridge, on which people are walking very fast, carrying their belongings in suitcases and bags. Some of them have carts, drawn by people or by horses, some even have cars or small trucks.Suddenly, German planes start dropping bombs on the people, who hide on the roadsides. When the planes are gone, people go back on the road. Among them, a young couple (Mr and Mrs Fossey), with their five or six-year-old daughter, Paulette (Brigitte Fossey), go back to their car, which doesn't want to start. Other people, bothered by this car in the middle of the road, pushes it outside the road. Paulette's parents take a few suitcases, Paulette takes her black and white puppy, and they all start running away on foot.Some more German planes are coming in the sky. Paulette and her parents lie down on the side of the road. A horse, frightened by the planes and the bombs, runs away, breaking one the wheel of its two-wheel cart. Paulette's puppy is also frightened by the noise and runs away on the bridge, with Paulette running behind it and her parents behind her.The four of them lie down in a nook of the bridge. But a plane machine-gun them and kills the parents and the dog. Paulette is spared. She looks at her parents and doesn't seem to understand exactly what happened. She gets up and goes away with the dead dog in her arms. She moves away to avoid the mad horse still pulling its one-wheel cart.The ¬´exode¬ª people are back on the road. Paulette is taken by a couple in their fifties, the female (Janine Zorelli) seated on a huge pile of bags and cases in a cart, and the male (Georges Sauval) pulling the cart. The female throws the dead dog in the river. But when the couple starts arguing with other people around them, Paulette gets down from the cart, and then down on the edge of the edge, following her dog floating on the water. She eventually catches it back, and we see the mad horse running behind her across the countryside.A bit further, a farmer, Mr Doll√© (Lucien Hubert) is working in a field with his wife (Suzanne Courtal), his elder son Georges (Jacques Marin), who seems to be in his early thirties, and his second son Raymond (Pierre M√©rov√©e). His younger son, Michel (Georges Poujouly), aged ten, is taking care of the cows. Michel notices the mad horse entering the field and tells his father.Georges comes closer to the horse, but, at this very moment, another plane comes flying above them. The horse jumps and kicks Georges in the stomach, and then runs away. Georges falls on the ground moaning and his parents and his brother Raymond carry him back to the farm, while Michel runs after a cow, who has gone away.The cow walks down to a stream, where it meets Paulette, who starts crying. Michel questions Paulette, who tells him about her dead parents, and her dead dog, which she is still holding. Michel tells her to leave the dog in a bush and help him to bring the cow back to the farm.Between the Doll√©'s farm and the neighbor one, the Gouard's farm, there is only a stream and a small wooden bridge. Both families have been fighting for year, they don't even know why anymore. When the children walk in the farmyard, Mr Doll√© doesn't even notice them, being too busy chasing the Gouard's dog. He starts arguing with Mr Gouard (Andr√© Wasley), and then, walking back to his farm, eventually notices Paulette. Michel tells him who she is. His father doesn't seem too keen on the idea of taking care of the little girl, so Michel says he is going to take her to the Gouard's farm. Which gets Mr Doll√© very angry, and he pushes both kids in front of him and inside the farm.In the large main room of the farm, Raymond and his older sister Berthe (Laurence Badie) are undressing Georges to put him in bed. Georges notices Paulette and the whole family looks at her, including the youngest of the girls, Ren√©e (Violette Monnier), aged thirteen-fourteen. The girls look at Paulette's dress, the mother gives her a glass of milk, with a fly floating on it, and all of them ask her a lot of questions. Paulette, annoyed by them, pushes them away, and tells discreetly to Michel that she is tired.Later in the evening, Paulette is asleep on Mr Doll√©'s lap. He is reading the newspaper while Michel is doing his homework. On the paper, the picture of a soldier attracts Berthe's attention, because he looks like Francis, Gouard's elder son, who is a soldier in the French army. It is obvious that there is ¬´something¬ª between those two young people, something they must hide from their families.Raymond then talks about the ¬´exode¬ª people dead on the road. Because of a shortage of coffins, they had to be buried in a hole in the ground, ¬´like dogs¬ª. His father shuts him up, because he is afraid that Paulette is not quite asleep and may hear what he says. The mother, along with Berthe, Ren√©e and Michel, brings Paulette in the attic, where a bed has been set for her, while the father sits on Georges' bed to read the paper to him.When Paulette is in bed, everyone goes back down in the main room, Michel going out last. Paulette whispers to him that she doesn't want to stay alone. Michel advises her to call him with a very loud voice.Paulette does what Michel asks her, which annoys Georges, who doesn't feel very good. His father tells Michel to go up in the attic to quiet Paulette down.Paulette and Michel talk in the dark, but soon German bombings light the room. Paulette is scared and Michel closes the shutter on the window. Paulette actually heard what Raymond said and asks Michel if her parents are going to be buried ¬´like dogs¬ª. Michel doesn't know what to answer.Later in the night, the whole Doll√© family is asleep except Georges, because of the pain in his stomach. Paulette has a nightmare and starts yelling. Georges throws a box on Michel to wake him up. Michel takes a petrol lamp to check on Paulette, who is already half-asleep when Michel reaches the attic. Michel walks back down and reads the paper to Georges to keep him company.Next morning, the whole family is having breakfast, except Paulette, who is still getting dressed in the attic. She walks down and inquires about the crucifix above Georges' bed. We understand that Paulette's family were atheists, which doesn't seem to please the Doll√©, who are good catholics. Mrs Doll√© also talks about mentioning Paulette to the gendarmes (the French country police).Michel walks out of the farm and Raymond comes in with the hats the ¬´exode¬ª people have left on the road. He clowns, which makes Georges laugh, even with the pain in his stomach.Discreetly without Michel seeing her, Paulette finds the place where she left her dog, and, with a hoe, she starts digging a hole to bury it. She is interrupted by the local vicar (Louis Saint√®ve), who, learning who she is, wants to teach her the sign of the cross. But Paulette, who is holding her dog hidden behind her back, doesn't want to do it.The vicar walks away, and Paulette, hearing Michel call her, takes her hoe and her dog and walks away to an old disused water mill, inside which she starts digging again. Michel joins her and helps her digging. Michel suggests that they create a dead animals cemetery. He climbs up under the roof of the mill to the nest of a old owl, and takes a dead mole from the nest. He digs another tomb for the mole, and tells Paulette they're going to put crosses on each tomb. He has to show atheist Paulette what a cross exactly is. Paulette then puts her broken necklace on her dog's cross.Later in the evening, Michel is in the attic making crosses with pieces of wood, nails and a hammer, while teaching Paulette her prayers, as the vicar asks him to do.Down in the main room, Georges is feeling worse and worse, and Michel hammering above his head doesn't help him to feel better. His father walks up in the attic to see what Michel is doing. When he sees that Michel is making crosses in the house of a sick man, he gets very angry, brings Paulette down and tells Michel he will stay in the attic without eating.In the main room, the whole family is gathered round the table to eat the evening soup. Raymond checks on his brother, who is spitting blood. Georges is dying and the family doesn't know what to do about it. The mother says that a prayer would help, but the only one who knows his prayers well is Michel, who is ordered back into the main room.Michel, who didn't like being punished, starts mumbling false prayers. When the mother tries to give Georges castor oil, and sees that he doesn't move his lips anymore, the whole family understands he is dead. Michel stops mumbling, kneels down by his brother's bed and says real prayers. Paulette walks near him and, whispering, asks him if he is going to dig a hole for his brother, which horrifies Michel.Next day, Mr Doll√© is fixing the floor of his hearse, when Michel notices that the four little wooden crosses are not well fixed on the roof of the hearse. He looks for Paulette to tell her about it, and finds her feeding the chicks.Early next morning, Francis Gouard (Philippe de Ch√©risey, known as Am√©d√©e) is coming back to his father's farm, in full military uniform, and plays his bugle before he gets in. The Doll√© family is having breakfast, and, intrigued by the sound of the bugle, they send Michel to spy on the Gouard farm. Michel takes a basket and a sickle and pretends he is cutting grass for the rabbits.Michel walks very close to the Gouard farm window, still pretending he is cutting grass. And he sees Francis telling his father and his two sisters, Marcelle (Fernande Roy) and Jeanne (Denise P√©ronne), how he left the defeated French army. Michel comes closer to the window, and closer to a cage full of young chicks, which he starts stealing, putting them inside his shirt. Mr Gouard sees him and chases him away.Back into his own farm, Michel just tells his parents that Francis is back home, and runs away to meet Paulette. Mr Doll√©, who is not such a fool as Berthe believes him to be, tells her not to go and see Francis.Michel rushes to the attic, where he shows Paulette the chicks, swearing he didn't kill them.Later in the day, Paulette is picking flowers in a field, when she sees Berthe and Francis flirting in the grass. She moves away to meet Michel, who shows her the crosses he just took off from the hearse, and which Paulette finds ugly.It is Georges' funeral. The hearse stops in front of the church, and the coffin is being carried inside. Everyone follows the coffin, except Mr Doll√©, who wants to check the wooden floor of his hearse. He is met by a latecomer cousin, who walks inside the church.Inside the church, Michel and Paulette are more interested by the crosses on the walls than by the funeral ceremony.Outside, Mr Doll√© is still fixing his hearse, when the Gouard daughters, crossing the village with their cows, see him and make fun of him. They walk away and Mr Doll√© notices the missing crosses on the roof of the hearse. He goes inside the church and asks Michel to come outside with him. Michel feels ill at ease, and tells his father that the crosses could have been stolen by the Gouard, a lie his father seems to believes.Back inside the church, Paulette doesn't seem interested by what Michel tells her about his father, but more interested by the big copper cross above the altar.Meanwhile, Francis and his father are sawing wood inside a barn. Mr Gouard says that he doesn't know how Mr Doll√© is going to manage his farm without Georges, and Francis answers him there is still Berthe, whom his father calls a hooker. The argument heats up, and Francis says he will marry Bethe, whether his father likes it or not.The funeral ceremony is now over and the hearse enters the churchyard, where Michel and Paulette are fascinated by the crosses. While he is shoveling earth on the buried coffin, Mr Doll√© tells the vicar about Gouard stealing the crosses of the hearse, but the vicar doesn't seem to believe it.One of two days later, inside the church, Michel is confessing the stealing of the crosses to the vicar. The vicar tells him to give the crosses back and asks him to say a few prayers as a penance. Then Berthe enters the confessional, while Michel kneels down on a prie-dieu to say his prayers. He keeps looking at the big cross above the altar. He takes off his shoes, grabs a chair and walks around the altar to steal the cross.Meanwhile, Berthe is telling the vicar she already had sex with Francis, and, since they do want to marry, she asks the priest to fix things with both their families. The vicar can't answer because of the booming noise made by Michel falling down while trying to steal the cross. He rushes out of the confessional, kicks Michel out of the church and pushes Berthe back into the confessional.In the evening, Mr Doll√© tells his wife the conversation he had with his neighbor Gouard, who swore he didn't steal the crosses on his wife's tomb. We learn two things, one that Mr Gouard is a widower, two that he neglects his wife's tomb.In a corner of the main room, Michel is writing cards to put on the animals' tombs (dog, mole, worm, etc.). With his dip pen, he kills a cockroach, which makes Paulette cry.Mr Doll√© sends everyone in bed. Paulette kisses everybody around, including Michel, who reminds her that the vicar hit him when he tried to steal the cross. When Paulette is in bed in the attic, she asks Michel to go and steal the crosses in the churchyard.Later in the night, Berthe and Francis are flirting in the hay-barn, but they are interrupted by Paulette and Michel coming to get a wheelbarrow to carry the crosses. Francis hides in the hay, but Michel sees his feet sticking out.A bit later, Michel is pushing the wheelbarrow full of crosses on a path, while the German bombings are lighting the sky. Paulette sings to try to forget her fear. A cross falls on the ground, but the children don't even stop to pick it up. It is a small cross that Mrs Doll√© had put on her son's tomb.Next morning, a Sunday, the Doll√© family is getting ready to go to the churchyard and put flowers on Georges' tomb. When Mr Gouard sees them from his window, he tells his children to get ready to go to the churchyard. Michel, who knows very well what his parents are going to find in the churchyard, tries not to go, but his father kicks him in front of him.On the path leading to the churchyard, Mrs Doll√© picks up the cross fallen from the wheelbarrow. Michel tries to run back to the farm, but the Gouard family, coming behind him, leaves him no escape. Mr Gouard explains to his children that he is going to show Doll√© that he knows how to take care of a tomb.The Doll√© family reaches the churchyard and finds there are no more crosses on Georges' tomb. The father, who thinks he knows who did it, rushes toward Mrs Gouard's tomb, from which he snatches and breaks the cross. Mr Gouard walks to him and both men first insult each other, then they start fighting and finally they fall into a freshly dug tomb, where they keep on fighting. Berthe runs to the church to get the vicar, who explains to both families who is stealing the crosses. Michel runs away from the churchyard, with both families running after him.Inside the old mill, Michel has completed his animals' cemetery, with the crosses and the cards naming each animal. Satisfied by his work, he quietly eats an apple.Later in the evening, the Doll√© family is getting ready to go to bed. Ren√©e is reading a love story, but the parents are wondering where Michel has gone, and their try to list the fourteen crosses the vicar said Michel has stolen. They don't know that Michel is watching them hidden behind a window. When his father walks outside in the farmyard, Michel hides inside the barn.From the barn, Michel climbs into the attic, where he doesn't find Paulette, who is being questioned by Berthe about the crosses. Michel, hidden in the staircase leading to the attic, follows the conversation, and when he feels that Paulette is ready to talk, he whispers to Berthe that, if she tells their father about him, he will tell their father about Berthe flirting with Francis in the barn.Paulette climbs into the attic, where Michel is waiting for her. He tells her that he can't take her and shows her the animals' cemetery, because his father has locked all the doors.Next morning, Paulette wakes up Michel, who is sleeping in the barn. Meanwhile, two gendarmes (Andr√© Enard and Bernard Musson), are walking toward the two farms. Francis thinks they're coming to get him, and Raymond thinks they're coming because the Gouard told them about Michel stealing the crosses. Berthe tells her father about Michel being in the barn, and Mr Doll√© rushes inside the barn, where he gives his son a good thrashing, while Paulette starts crying.Mrs Doll√© walks in the barn to explain her husband that the gendarmes only came to take Paulette away. Michel tells his parents that, if Paulette stays with him, he will tell them where the crosses are hidden. But, when the gendarmes walk in the barn, Mr Doll√© doesn't keep the promise he made to his son and signs the document the gendarme gives him. Michel runs away and Paulette tells the gendarmes her name is Paulette Doll√© (actually, we shall never know her real name).Inside the old mill, Michel throws all the crosses in the river, where they are floating away. Then he entrusts Paulette's broken necklace to the old owl.In the Red Cross refugees center, a nun (Madeleine Barbul√©) ties a badge bearing the name of ¬´Paulette Doll√©¬ª around Paulette's neck, and asks her to keep it. The nun walks away, and Paulette remains seated on her bench until she hears someone call ¬´Michel¬ª. Of course, it is not Michel Doll√©, but Paulette runs among the refugees calling ¬´Michel¬ª.A last scene has been added in earlier versions of the film, actually the same versions which have the first scene with the two well-dressed children who look like Michel and Paulette. In this added scene, the little boy finishes his story, and the little girl starts crying. To comfort her, the little boy tells her an imaginary ending of the story, in which Michel and Paulette are reunited and hides themselves in a place where nobody can find them. The little girl asks the little boy to hide them on their island in the middle of the lake."

tt0043859,"['Drama', 'Thriller']","Mr. Dennis Scott (Jack Hawkins) shows up for his first day of work as Chief of Metallurgy at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, England, UK, and reports to Sir John (Ronald Squire), the Director. Sir John immediately hands Scott over to Major Pearl (Maurice Denham), aka ""The Pearl of Great Price,"" for a tour of the testing facilities. The various tests that the RAE scientists have set up fascinate Scott, especially the last one, a prolonged ""vibration test"" of the double-elevator tail group of the RAE's latest creation, the Reindeer airliner, of which several hundred were delivered recently to the Trans-Atlantic Aircraft Corporation. Major Pearl cannot make himself heard over the tremendous noise, so he shuts down the test, thus provoking the lone scientist, Theodore Honey (James Stewart), to protest that the test must continue. Honey is very brusque and not very sociable at all, but Pearl explains to Scott that the RAE has had him since his days as a Rhodes Scholar from the USA and consider him quite valuable.Scott asks Honey the point of his exercise, and Honey says simply, ""I expect the tail to fall off."" Scott is not satisfied with that and offers to give Honey a lift to his home so that he can have an opportunity to press Honey further. Honey's theory is that the repeated vibration of thousands of flying hours must produce energy, and since that energy is not released as heat or in any other form, the metal itself must absorb it and eventually fail, at 1440 flying hours. Honey is quite oblivious to the consideration that people's lives might ride on his theory and calculations, and protests that as a scientist he cannot afford to concern himself with people.Honey's thoroughly eccentric attitudes carry forward into his home life. His wife is dead, but his daughter Elspeth (Janette Scott) remains, and he has been home-schooling her with a regimen of near-constant study. Scott finds Elspeth pleasant enough, but worries that she is even less socially adept even than Honey, difficult as Scott finds that to imagine.The next morning, Scott hoists a pint with an old friend of his, a test pilot named Bill Penworthy (David Hutcheson). The two men talk of a mutual friend, Harry Ward, a pilot for TAAC, who died in a crash in Labrador under mysterious circumstances. Penworthy voices contempt for a system that blithely attributes a mysterious airline crash to ""pilot's error"" just because the pilot is dead and thus unable to defend his reputation. The circumstances of the crash were these: the aircraft abruptly lost altitude, as if the pilot had taken a crash dive, something that Ward would never have done. But what makes Scott take Penworthy's story even more seriously is the make of the aircraft: a Reindeer.Scott asks Sir John's secretary, a man named Johnson (Hugh Cross), to show him every available photograph of the wreckage of Waring's plane. Johnson alarms him with two revelations: the aircraft had 1407 hours on it when it went down, and the tail group was never found. That, of course, was the very thing that Honey was testing. Could the tail have broken off from metal fatigue, as Honey had predicted and was even now testing out?Scott brings his suspicions to Sir John, who agrees to place Honey's vibration test on a round-the-clock schedule (instead of 8 hours a day) and to send Honey to Laborador on the next available flight to find the tail group and inspect it personally. And that is how Honey finds himself boarding TAAC Flight 26 to Montreal by way of Gander, Newfoundland. But what he does not realize until he is in the air is that his aircraft is a Reindeer.Aboard the flight, Stewardess Marjorie Corder (Glynnis Johns) at first notices a very nervous man who obviously has never been in an airliner before. Then Copilot Sam Dobson (Kenneth More) dumbfounds her with the announcement that they have an aeronautical scientist on board, and points him out as that very passenger (who is, of course, Honey). Marjorie rushes to apologize to Honey, who says that this is indeed his first-ever airline fight. Then she informs him that Captain Samuelson (Niall MacGinnis) has offered to give him a VIP tour of the cockpit, and in the process informs him that he is aboard a Reindeer. That is the first thing that really worries Honey. Then, when he takes the cockpit tour, he receives news that shocks him to the core: that the aircraft already has 1422 flying hours on it, more than the aircraft that crashed in Labrador! Now he tries to press Samuelson to turn back, because if he does not, the tail will break off and everyone on board will die. Samuelson is skeptical, of course, but agrees to radio London for instructions, and to feather his inboard engines to reduce the vibratory load.Back in the passenger cabin, Honey takes time to inspect the men's lavatory, which shares a bulkhead with the galley, a bulkhead bolted to the floor. Thus determining that that is the safest place in the aircraft in the event of a crash, he breathlessly introduces himself to a prominent female passenger, a movie star named Monica Teasdale (Marlene Dietrich). At the first sight of this strange little man with his whacked out theory, she presses the call button at her seat, and Marjorie shows up to usher Honey back to his seat. He cooperates, but not before he repeats to her exactly what he tried to tell Monica about the best place to ride out a crash. Marjorie goes to apologize to Monica, and then tries to explain what Honey was trying to tell her. Monica now becomes curious, especially when the two inboard engines shut off, indicating that the captain really did take Honey seriously. Whereupon Monica insists on sitting with Honey and getting him to explain everything to her. Subsequently, Monica and Honey sit out the rest of the flight in the galley, where they make small talk that suddenly doesn't seem so small.Samuelson receives no orders except to act at his own discretion. Because he is past the point of no return (the halfway point), he flies on, but requests clearance for an immediate, straight-in landing. He lands safely enough, and then orders a complete nose-to-tail inspection. But he next orders Marjorie to confine Honey to a private room in the Gander terminal, and not to allow him back aboard for the next leg of the flight.Honey is not convinced that the safe landing proved him wrong, and believes that the next flight that that aircraft makes will be its last. So when the captain asks everyone to come back aboard, Honey jostles his way aboard the aircraft and pushes into the cockpit, where Samuelson tells him to get off and stay off. Whereupon Honey spots the landing-gear lever and pulls it, thus retracting the landing gear while the aircraft is on the ground. That, of course, makes the aircraft unflyable.Monica, astounded, makes her way to Honey and praises him for the courage of his convictions, and announces that the experience is worth any delay he might have caused. Marjorie, for her part, is simply worried about the consequences to Honey of his actions.Sir John is furious, as much with the reaction of the press, not to mention the temperamental Sir David Moon (Hugh Wakefield), President of TAAC, as with Honey's actions, though Johnson finds the whole incident very funny. Sir John must also send an RAF pilot to fetch Honey back to Farnborough, as no TAAC pilot will dare have him as a passenger, and also send another investigator to Laborador to finish what Honey had set out to do there. In the middle of the excitement, Monica introduces herself to Sir John and tells him frankly that she was quite afraid that Honey's bosses would throw him to the wolves, a thing she did not wish to see happen.Honey returns to his laboratory and finds that others are running his experiment without him. He protests to Sir John, who informs him that he has to undergo psychological testing, while the vibration test will now run around the clock, either to failure or to 1440 hours. Honey then returns home to find that Marjorie has made it to his home ahead of him and has settled in as his housekeeper. Honey is very much worried about having done such a ""crazy"" thing, something that violates every rule of an ordered life that he had set for himself, but also knows that, given the same or similar circumstances, he would do the same thing again. Honey then expresses concern for the gossip that Marjorie's presence in his flat might cause, so she makes a quick trip to retrieve her nurse's uniform. (In that era, all flight attendants were recruited from among the ranks of registered nurses.)And so, when Monica comes to pay a call on Honey, she finds Marjorie there. Monica and Marjorie have a long chat, at the end of which Monica decides that she is not cut out to mix into Honey's life (a thing that no one should go into only halfway), and will return to making motion pictures to make sure that her life will have the meaning that Honey said it had.The experiment continues, but at 1440 hours the tail group does not fail. Honey returns home and confesses his failure to Marjorie, who tells him that if he really believes in his theory, he must defend it. He also has a heart-to-heart with Elspeth, who for the first time in her young life is seriously upset about her lack of any sort of socialization.Honey faces dismissal from the Establishment, and TAAC will not take its Reindeers out of service on account of Honey's theories. Whereupon Honey gives notice to the Establishment and threatens to wreck any Reindeer that is about to take off, and shouldn't, until people are simply afraid to fly on such aircraft.Honey returns to his flat and confesses that he has lost everything to Marjorie. Marjorie comforts him as best she can, and then announces that she will marry him, because he is so like a little boy who needs someone to look after him (especially after she discovers seven months' worth of payroll cheques that he has never deposited!).Back at the meeting, Sir John and Scott discuss Honey's threat, when Johnson rushes to Sir John with an urgent message: the investigator who had gone to Laborador in Honey's place has found the tail group, and that it had indeed failed from metal fatigue! Then Sir David Moon delivers his own breathless report: when the Reindeer that Honey had wrecked had undergone its repair, and taken off for a simple airworthiness test, had made a perfect landing, only to have the tail fall off as it taxied to the hangar!Scott and Sir John rush breathlessly to Honey's section of the laboratory to tell him that two reports from Gander and Labrador bear him out completely. Honey, with Marjorie by his side, acknowledges the reports but is still wondering why his own experiment failed. Sir John again tells him that the reports have vindicated him, when at that very instant the tail group breaks in half and crashes to the floor. As Sir John and Scott congratulate one another, Honey notices a swinging thermometer, and realizes at once that his experiment had not failed, but simply took longer than he calculated because he ran it in a heated shed, and that his own airliner had made it to Gander because it had piled up its flying hours serving a tropical route."

Although they now have a bigger house, no one is happy about the move but Mr. Winfield. His wife complains that nothing fits; the curtains are too short and the carpets aren't wide enough. Their children, eighteen-year-old Marjorie and eleven-year-old Wesley, are also grumpy. The maid Stella reports that the kitchen is too big and she won't be able to get food to the table while it's still hot. Mr. Winfield ignores their pleas to move back to their old house. He spots a neighbor boy outside and orders Wesley to introduce himself and be friendly.The boy, Jim Sherman, claims that his father has a pistol once used to shoot outlaw Jesse James. Wesley asks to see it. They retrieve the pistol and go into the Shermans' barn to shoot it. But it won't work. Marjorie, who has joined a baseball game, sees the boys enter the barn and runs to stop them from getting hurt. She grabs the pistol from Wesley and tries to put the safety device back in place. Outside, a handsome young man is calling for Jim, obviously his brother because he shouts that their mother is looking for him. Marjorie accidentally fires the pistol, narrowly missing the young man and blowing the barn doors off. Jim gasps that his brother is dead. But although knocked down, Bill Sherman is very much alive. The boys run off, leaving Marjorie to face the music. Because she is wearing a baseball uniform, Bill mistakes her for a boy. But when he turns her over his knee and spanks her, he realizes she is a girl.Later that evening, Bill comes to take Marjorie dancing at a local resort, Moonlight Bay. It is tomboy Marjorie's first date and she is uncomfortable in a dress and high heels. Her mother insists that she pad her bust with powder puffs. But while the two are dancing, the puffs fall out. Marjorie is very embarrassed and feels the evening is ruined. They stop at a carnival booth, where Bill declares he will win her a Kewpie doll. But he cannot throw and misses the pins. Marjorie takes over and manages to knock down all the pins, winning a doll for herself.
When Bill takes her home, she invites him inside for a glass of buttermilk. But the lights go out and in the dark, she experiences her first kiss.Some weeks later, Mr. Winfield is annoyed because Bill is at the house all the time. He decides to ask the young man his intentions. Bill and Marjorie are sitting on the front porch, playing records and singing. Wesley is under the porch, mimicking Bill in a high-pitched whine. Marjorie stomps on the floor and dust covers Wesley, who reluctantly crawls out. He leaves when Bill gives him money for candy.Mr. WInfield joins the couple and at first is pleasant. But when Bill declares his disapproval of bankers, an embarrassed Marjorie tells him that her father is vice-president of the local bank. Bill apologizes but Mr. Winfield orders him to stay away. He encourages Marjorie to date Hubert Wakely, a boring, priggish young man who is also Wesley's piano teacher. But Marjorie can't stand him.Bill returns to college but the two write to each other. Just as she is finishing a letter to Bill, Wesley realizes he was supposed to compose a letter to a friend on a general subject, for a homework assignment. When Marjorie leaves the room, Wesley takes her letter and signs his own name. Unfortunately, the teacher, Miss Stevens, decides to have the students read their letters aloud. Wesley begins with confidence, then his voice trails off as he realizes it is a steamy love letter. The other students laugh and the teacher makes him sit on a stool the rest of the day. He decides to get even with Marjorie, even though she had done nothing to him.When Hubert Wakely comes to call, Wesley sits in the parlor with them. Hubert hints for him to leave, but he claims to be looking for his dog. At last Hubert asks Marjorie to take a walk, but Wesley follows them. It is nearly dark when they return and an exhausted Hubert takes himself off.Unknown to Bill, Marjorie begins taking dance lessons so she can learn the latest steps. Bill is coming home from college and they plan to attend the big Christmas dance. On her way home, Marjorie is accosted by several boys who throw snowballs at her. She chases after them and trips over a garbage can, badly spraining her ankle. Sadly, she telephones Bill and tells him she can't go to the dance after all. She is too embarrassed to tell him why, and believes he will not come home.Wesley is to be an angel in a group of carolers, directed by Hubert Wakely. His mother, Stella, and Marjorie make him try on his costume, complete with wings and a halo. Suddenly he realizes that it was made from an old petticoat of Marjorie's. He tears off the costume, breaking his wings, and yells that he will not be an angel because everyone will recognize Marjorie's old petticoat. He escapes his father's ire and takes refuge in a movie theater. The silent picture is about a respectable husband and father who is forced into a saloon and gets drunk. Staggering home, he beats his wife and daughter, throwing them out of the house into the snow. Then he has a change of heart, begging them to forgive them and swearing that he will never drink again.The next morning, Wesley falls asleep in class and dreams he is flying about the room. His friends applaud him, especially when he shouts at Miss Stevens to leave him alone. Suddenly he wakes up and realizes Miss Stevens is standing over him. His friends are not applauding but laughing. Wesley is in big trouble and has to stay after school. He feeds Miss Stevens the plot of the movie, substituting his real family for the actors. The reason he fell asleep in class, he says, is that he was up all night taking care of his mother and sister after they were beaten by his father Miss Stevens is moved to tears and assures him that she understands.The next day, Mrs. Winfield reports running into Miss Stevens and having the teacher take her hand. She found it quite embarrassing when Miss Stevens told her to take courage, that everything would be all right. Miss Stevens also says that she is sure Wesley is a great comfort to Mrs. Winfield. No one can understand any of it and Mr. Winfield thinks Miss Stevens may be going senile.Later that evening, Stella applies rubbing alcohol to Marjorie's leg. Since Wesley still refuses to wear his angel costume, his father orders him to bed. He falls asleep on the sofa and Mrs. Winfield spreads a newspaper over his face, to keep out the light. Suddenly there is a persistent knocking at the door. It is Bill, home from college. He strides over to Marjorie and, on seeing her injured ankle, announces that it is true. He didn't believe any of it, even after what Miss Stevens told him about Mr. Winfield drinking and beating his family. The Winfields are bewildered and Wesley, lingering on the stairs, knows he is about to be found out. Bill says he can smell alcohol and Marjorie shows him the bottle of rubbing alcohol. Bill is so disgusted that he throws it into the fire, causing a big blaze. Before anyone can stop him, he grabs a picture of water and pours it on Mr. Winfield, accusing him of being a drunken brute. Marjorie screams at him to get out, that she never wants to see him again. Stella threatens him with a mop and Mrs. Winfield asks if he has lost his mind. Before being propelled through the front door, Bill says that Miss Stevens told him the whole story, which she had gotten from Wesley.Suddenly the family realizes what must have happened. Marjorie hobbles outside, begging Bill to come back. Mr. Winfield goes looking for Wesley, intending to give him a sound spanking. But his son is missing. Bill accepts Marjorie's apology and they kiss. Just then the carolers come down their street. Wesley is on the front row, wearing his costume with its broken wings. He looks so innocent that his parents decide not to punish him.In the spring, the Winfields attend Bill's college graduation. He hints that he has a surprise for Marjorie but won't tell her what it is, adding that she will know soon enough. Mr. Winfield has come to accept Bill and asks Marjorie if they will be setting a date soon. When she replies that he doesn't believe in marriage, Mr. Winfield is shocked and then angry. He forces the family to leave the ceremony, even though Bill, as valedictorian, is making a speech. At the end of it, he and the other graduates remove their robes. They are wearing army uniforms, having just enlisted. Even that doesn't move Mr. Winfield. He orders Marjorie never to see Bill again.Time passes and Marjorie continues to grieve for Bill. With her father's encouragement, Hubert Wakely begins calling on Marjorie again. Mrs. Winfield says that Marjorie can't stand him, but Mr. Winfield believes that will change. Best of all, Hubert was turned down for the army because of his punctured ear drum. Stella makes a crack about him having punctured it just before his physical.Jim Sherman asks if Wesley can go to the train station with him, as a troop train carrying Bill will be passing through. Mr. Winfield says no. Wesley grumbles that he doesn't see why he can't go, since Marjorie is going. His parents are shocked to learn that Wesley saw her packing a suitcase. Realizing that she intends to elope with Bill, Mr. Winfield hurries to the station to stop her.Marjorie searches the cars until she finds Bill. She declares her intention of going with him, no matter what her father says. She will get a place to live near the army camp. They go outside and he proposed marriage to her. She accepts and he tells her to get the next train to Chicago, where he will meet her and they will be married at once. But Mr. Winfield appears and tears Marjorie away, telling her she is coming home to grow up.Wesley apologizes to Marjorie for telling on her and she says it doesn't matter now. Bill is gone and it will be a very long time, if ever, before she sees him again.The Winfields throw a party for Wesley to celebrate his twelfth birthday. Their elderly Aunt Martha arrives and gives him three presents; a box of home-baked cookies and a pocketknife. The last is a slingshot. Aunt Martha explains that she took it away from Wesley's father thirty-five years ago, when he was twelve, after he killed her best laying hen. She thinks maybe he can be trusted with it now. The party is a wash-out, since Hubert Wakely is in charge of the entertainment and bores the children by playing and singing. Wesley is mad because he couldn't have the sort of party he wanted, and after a while slips away.Meanwhile, Bill comes to the back door and asks for Marjorie. He has an unexpected pass home, but can only stay a short time. Marjorie rushes into his arms and Mr. Winfield reminds him that he is not welcome in their home. Marjorie asks for and receives permission to walk to the gate with him. Meanwhile, Mrs. Winfield confronts her husband. She reminds him that Bill is a great deal like himself as a young man. Marjorie comes in and rushes upstairs, sobbing. Wesley uses the slingshot, only it breaks and sends the stone crashing through the front window. Mr. Winfield is furious until Wesley tells him what Aunt Martha said. He had forgotten the incident and ponders briefly. Then he goes to the phone and calls the Sherman residence, asking whoever answers to tell Bill that his across the street neighbor suddenly remembered that he was young once. Marjorie overhears and after kissing her father, rushes outside. Bill meets her halfway and they embrace. Hubert Wakely, on his way out, realizes he has lost Marjorie once and for all. Wesley hands him his hat and Hubert jams it on his head. The brim has been cut and the hat is ruined. Wesley smiles and looks at his pocketknife as Hubert stalks angrily down the street."

He locks himself in his room and takes his gruel by a small fire. Suddenly all of the bells around him begin to ring, and just as suddenly stop. A clanking and banging out on the stairs soon reveal the ghost of Jacob Marley. Scrooge denies believing in the ghost, thinking it is more likely to be an issue with his digestion, but the ghost eventually convinces him. Marley is doomed to walk the earth, unable to help his fellow man, since he never did so when alive. He wears a long chain, and tells Scrooge that his chain will be even longer. Scrooge points out that Marley was a good man of business, but Marley explains that mankind was his business. He offers Scrooge a chance of escaping Marley's fate by the visits of three spirits. He also shows Scrooge through the window the ghosts of many people surrounding a woman and baby shivering in the snow, and explains that they wish to help her but cannot. Scrooge slams the window shut, runs to his bed and hides under the covers.When the clock strikes one, Scrooge is awakened by the first ghost, the ghost of Christmas past. He takes Scrooge through time to his old school, where young Scrooge is alone as the other boys have left for Christmas. A knock on the door reveals his sister Fan, who has come to take him home. She promises to care for him as long as she lives, and Scrooge tells her that she must live forever. Older Scrooge tells the spirit that Fan had died giving Fred life, just as Scrooge's mother had died giving him life, a fact for which his father never forgave him.The scene changes to a party at Fezziwig's, where Scrooge had been apprenticed. He tells the spirit that the happiness Fezziwig had given them was as great as if it had cost a fortune, a fact that gives Scrooge pause. They look in the corner, where a younger Scrooge is romancing a woman named Alice. As they watch, she accepts his marriage proposal.The scene switches again to Fezziwig refusing a buyout offer from a Mr. Snedrick. They want to replace all of the workers with machines. Later, Scrooge visits Fan's deathbed. She asks him to promise her something. Young Scrooge leaves the scene thinking Fan has died, but then older Scrooge learns that she had asked him to take care of her son. Later again, Scrooge has accepted a job offer with Mr. Snedrick, where he meets another clerk, the young Jacob Marley.Eventually, Fezziwig is forced to sell his company to Snedrick's firm. Alice confronts Scrooge, telling him he fears the world too much. She tells him that, penniless, he would not seek her out again, and returns his engagement ring.Still later, a company owned by a Mr. Jorkin goes under due to his embezzlement. Jorkin is unrepentant and warns that punishing him would not be worth for the scandal that would rock the company, resulting in bankruptcy for all involved. Scrooge and Marley, members of the board, warn that the danger is serious, but while they disagree with Jorkin's methods, they offer to make good Jorkin's debts in return for majority control of the company. The rest of the board protest, but ultimately apparently agreed to the proposal.Another Christmas, with Marley dying, Scrooge refuses to go to him until the day's business is concluded. At seven o'clock, he enters Marley's rooms and listens to his breath before Marley wakes. Marley tells him that they had been wrong and that Scrooge should save himself before expiring.Scrooge wakes in his own bed, but a voice beckons him from the next room. Investigating, he finds the spirit of Christmas present. They visit miners, and then watch Bob Cratchitt's happy, although small, Christmas celebration. The spirit tells Scrooge that Tim will die if circumstances don't change. Cratchitt announces that he has a situation in mind for his son Peter, and then toasts Mr. Scrooge. The family objects, with Mrs. Cratchitt calling Scrooge hard and stingy. Eventually they relent and reluctantly toast Scrooge.Meanwhile, Fred is also toasting Scrooge at his Christmas dinner. He says he feels sorry for Scrooge. Alice, who has become a nurse, takes care of patients at a home. The spirit asks Scrooge if he will profit from the experience, but Scrooge is unsure. The spirit shows Scrooge two children under his care, Want and Ignorance. Scrooge runs, and runs directly into the Spirit of Christmas Yet To Come.They visit Cratchitt's house, where Tim has passed away. Bob returns home, after visiting Tim's resting place. They then visit the rag-and-bones man Old Joe, as a laundress, a charwoman, and an undertaker come to pawn their spoils. They discuss the man they'd all stripped, who had been unkind and miserly. Joe gives the undertaker eight shillings and the laundress seventeen and sixpence. The charwoman had taken the bedcurtains from around the corpse and stripped the expensive shirt from it, leaving him to be buried in calico. Moving to the stock exchange, two businessmen discuss the funeral, one insisting on having a lunch provided if he was to attend. Scrooge realizes he is nowhere to be seen. Finally, the spirit takes Scrooge to a cemetery, where he sees his own name on a tombstone. Once again Scrooge wakes in his own bed.The charwoman knocks and enters, and tells him that it is still Christmas day. Scrooge tells her that he feels as light as a feather and as giddy as a school boy, but when he tries to stand on his head in his nightshirt she runs out screaming. He chases her out and gives her a guinea as a Christmas present. Hearing bells, he runs to the window and opens it. Seeing a small boy run past, he tells him to buy a large prize turkey from a butcher and sends it to the Cratchitts. They puzzle over who could have sent it, but Tim suspects Scrooge. Scrooge then visits his nephew for dinner. Unsure of his welcome but gently prodded by the housekeeper whom he treated cordially just then, he enters to the strains of ""Barbara Allen."" With delight undiminished by his conversation with Ebenezer the previous day, Fred welcomes him in and Scrooge asks Fred's wife for forgiveness. She warmly accepts and they dance a polka together.The next day, Scrooge arrives at the countinghouse. Cratchitt shows up a full fifteen minutes late, and tries to sneak in. Scrooge calls him into his office. Cratchitt, expecting to be fired, apologizes profusely; but instead Scrooge tells him he is raising Cratchett's salary, and tells him to go out and buy a new coal scuttle.In the final scene, the Narrator notes that Scrooge was better than his word and is now respected and admired throughout London as a changed man who knows how best to keep Christmas in his heart, if any man possesses the knowledge. Tim is shown running to Scrooge, no longer limping."

tt0044030,"['Drama', 'Family', 'Musical', 'Romance']","The river boat ""Cotton Blossom"" has just arrived in a small town. It is a show boat, which stops at every city before they wind up the season at New Orleans. As the boat pulls into the dock with a chorus singing and dancing, everybody, blacks and whites alike, stops whatever they are doing and runs to the banks of the river. Captain Andy Hawks (Joe E. Brown) announces that evening's show, and the main performers act out a sneak peek of the play to be performed that night. This time there is trouble, as Pete, the boat engineer, makes a pass at leading actress Julie LaVerne (Ava Gardner). When he is rejected, he threatens Julie and is beaten up by Steve Baker (Robert Sterling), Julie's husband, who is the leading man of the company. Furious, Pete goes to see the local sheriff.Magnolia Hawks (Kathryn Grayson), the daughter of the captain and his wife Parthy (Agnes Moorehead), wants to be the leading actress as well, but her snobbish, ill-tempered mother won't hear of it. Riverboat gambler Gaylord Ravenal (Howard Keel) gambles away all his money, including the ticket he has bought to go to New Orleans. He goes to the show boat, wanting to talk to the captain. He overhears Magnolia practicing at ""acting"" and he tells her that she should be the leading lady of the show. Magnolia is over the moon, although she doesn't think that she is ever going to actually make it.That night, as dancers Ellie and Frank are performing on the stage of the show boat, the sheriff arrives. It is discovered that Julie is half-black and passing as white and is therefore illegally married to Steve, who is white. (Interracial marriage was against the law at that time.) Steve successfully pretends he is also half-black, but if the couple stay on the boat, they would both be classified as black, and in 1880's Mississippi, African-Americans could not perform on the stage; black characters were always performed by whites in blackface makeup. And so, Julie and Steve both have to leave the boat.Gaylord hears of this, and turns up at the dock just after Julie and Steve have left. Desperate, Captain Hawks gives the job of leading man to Gaylord and makes Magnolia the new leading lady, at least until they reach New Orleans and they can look for replacements. As usual, Parthy does not like the idea, but the dire straits they are in force her to agree. Magnolia and Gaylord soon fall in love. Their performance becomes a smash hit along the river because their emotions are not fake. Parthy insists that they do not kiss onstage, but one night after the show she discovers her daughter and the gambler kissing on the deck. Ravenal announces that he has asked Magnolia to marry him and that she has accepted. Parthy storms off angrily. A concerned Cap'n Andy tells Ravenal that he hopes it won't be Saturday night one minute, and a cold Monday morning the next.The happy couple is married (offscreen), leaves the boat and moves to Chicago. They stay at the luxurious hotel Sherman, but they have been unable to pay for their room, as Gaylord does not try to get a job and spends all their money on gambling, always losing but hoping on hitting the jackpot on the next occasion. The hotel manager (Edward Keane) gives him until the next day only to pay his dues, or they will have to leave. Magnolia offers her jewels to her husband, but Gaylord refuses to accept them. However, that night, pressed to pay his gambling debts on the spot, he asks for the family jewels, saying that it's only a temporary lending. Magnolia reminds him that many things can be temporary except for their love. Pretty soon they have to sneak out of the hotel, trying to avoid to be seen by the hotel receptionist (John Crawford), leaving a six-week credit hole to their names.Finally, Gaylord and Magnolia have an argument. She is disillusioned about their life and blames him for being weak, asking him not to touch her. Soon after, out of guilt, he leaves her. At their apartment, where Magnolia has been left stranded, arrives Frank Schulz, (Gower Champion) and his wife Ellie, the dance team who formerly worked on the show boat, who are looking for a room. The Schulzs have an audition at the Trocadero. They talk about their old times at the ""Cotton Blossom"", and it's then that Magnolia reads a written note from Gaylord saying that he's leaving.Julie works at the Trocadero but has become an alcoholic because Steve has left her after all their difficulties passing as white. Her boss tries to keep Julie sober. Frank, having no idea that Julie works there, convinces the manager to give Magnolia an opportunity. The manager is not convinced, even after hearing Magnolia audition. Julie has also heard it from backstage, without letting Magnolia know that she has been working there. Julie realizes that Magnolia needs the job, and quits so that the manager will have no choice but to hire Magnolia. She leaves behind a note to the manager, saying that if he does not hire Magnolia, he's crazy.New Year's Eve: The Schulzs perform and they are a hit. Magnolia performs and she is a miss: depressed over Ravenal's leaving her, she sings as if she had stage fright. However, a drunk member of the audience - Captain Andy Hawks - tells everybody to shut up and inspires Magnolia to have confidence, upon which she begins to sing beautifully. The audience cheers its approval, and Magnolia is a hit eventually. Andy and Magnolia talk. He recommends her to forget Gaylord forever, but she says it's impossible for her, especially when she tells him that she is pregnant. Gaylord doesn't even know; Magnolia did not have the heart to tell him because of his financial difficulties, and then he left her without saying goodbye. In spite of the possibilities of success in New York, Magnolia wants to be back at the boat and she returns with Andy, Frank, and Ellie.Soon afterwards, Kim Ravenal is born. About five years pass; Kim (Sheila Clark) is even learning how to dance. Cut to Gaylord, always alone, always frustrated with his luck, always in the middle of strangers, always gambling away his happiness. On a packet boat, Julie and Gaylord meet for the first time, after he punches out the drunk who has just slapped her. Julie discovers who he is and tells him off, not realizing that he did not know that Magnolia was pregnant when he left her. Julie then asks Gaylord to promise that he won't tell Magnolia that he had found Julie drunk, working as a saloon girl. Feeling enormous pity for her, he agrees.Gaylord approaches Kim, unbeknownst to her that he's her father. They start to play Make Believe together. Magnolia appears and she and Ravenal are reconciled.

Carroll). While on a train to his hometown Metcalf to meet Miriam, Haines encounters Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) when they bump feet under a table, a pushy stranger who recognizes Guy from the sports pages and gossip items in the newspapers and wants to discuss his marital problems. During lunch in Bruno's compartment, Bruno tells Guy about his idea for the perfect ""crisscross"" murders: he will kill Guy's wife Miriam, and in exchange Guy will kill Bruno's domineering father. Since they are unconnected strangers, there is no identifiable motive for the crimes, and therefore no suspicion from the police. Guy hurriedly departs the compartment, but leaves Bruno thinking he has agreed to the deal by agreeing that the theory is OK and that he likes it just so he can get clear of Bruno. Guy accidentally leaves behind his monogrammed cigarette lighter, engraved 'From A to G' and a gift from Anne, that he lent Bruno. Guy meets Miriam at her work in advance of going to meet her lawyer on the divorce. Miriam calls off the divorce, says she is pregnant with another man's child, and wants to go to Washington and play the political wife. Guy threatens Miriam and the encounter becomes physical until it is broken up. An upset Guy then calls Anne and tells her he wants to break Miriam's neck and could strangle her. Bruno calls Guy on the phone and finds out that the divorce is off and that Miriam has double-crossed Guy. In the background, Bruno's father is talking to his wife about restraining Bruno and getting him under control.Bruno arrives in Guy's hometown and follows Miriam and her two beaus to an amusement park, where he creepily follows the threesome around. He follows them on a boat ride to an island and strangles Miriam to death. Guy is wanted by the police for questioning as he has motive and is the prime suspect. Guy's alibi, a college professor who was inebriated when they met on a train, cannot remember Guy or anything else when tracked down by the police.

Soon after, Bruno appears at a party at Senator Morton's house and hobnobs with the guests, much to Guy's apprehension and Anne's increasing suspicion. Using another guest, he demonstrates how to strangle someone while preventing them from screaming; while doing this he sees Anne's younger sister Barbara (Patricia Hitchcock). Her eyeglasses and resemblance to Miriam trigger a flashback, and Bruno goes into a trance and really begins to strangle the guest before he faints. Barbara rushes to her sister and tells her, ""His hands were on her throat ... but he was strangling me."" Anne notices the resemblance between her sister and Miriam and puts together the facts of the crime and confronts Guy, who admits the truth.Guy agrees to Bruno's plan over the telephone and creeps into Bruno's home at night. When he reaches the father's room he tries to warn the older man of Bruno's intentions, but finds Bruno waiting for him instead. Bruno tells Guy that, because he will not complete his end of the bargain, he should take responsibility for the murder which ""belongs"" to him and pay for the crime from which he is benefiting and to that end Bruno will frame Guy for the murder of Miriam.Anne visits Bruno's house and tells his befuddled mother (Marion Lorne) that her son is responsible for murder, but the woman does not believe her and will not admit how dangerous her son is.

He does well as a blue collar travelling salesman, moves to New Orleans and marries Stella (Hunter), daughter of an Aristocratic MIssissippi family anxious to escape the war;s invitable destruction of her family's land, wealth, property and social status. Stanley has never met his sister-in-law Blanche, the female lead of the play ,Vivien Leigh in the movie remake. Blanche arranges a visit to see her sister in New Orleans and shows up on Stanley's doorstop obviously annoyed that there is neither a guest bedroom for herself nor a master bedroom for her sister and brother-in-law, in their cramped, dingy apartment in a bustling quarter of the city. The tensions of wartime emergency cohabitation of family members somehow forced to move in with each other in tight, cramped quarters because of the fortunes of war are noted when it is obvious that Blanche and Stanley immediately get on each others' nerves, especially when Blanche, who passes herself off as the only Aristocrat in her new neighborhood, is the only one in her new neighborhood who actually resorts to tough bar language and ethnic slurs in passing conversation. This becomes no ordinary domestic quarrel when their tensions escalate beyond a war of words to hurtful, spiteful deeds and then to climatic physical violence. Hollywood icons Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh are given close, tight photography in their lengthy scenes of escalating conflict, played with such deep insight and such technical brilliance that the audience is given pause, from moment to moment. to decide whether one really has a point and the other should really be apprehended by the authorities. Stanley first wants to know why Blanche seems to be planning to stay for life and what happened to his wife's claim on the family fortune, land, property and social status. Blanche wants Stanley to give up his weekly card game and his weekly bowling tournament with his friends including Mitch (Malden), to stay at home always sweating in his dirtied work clothes because he will have no place to wash and change with a lady in his house, sitting silent like a statue, until he decides it is time to just turn his paycheck over to Stella and move out so Blanche can rule the roost.
When Blanche attracts the attention of lonely Mitch who sees the remnants of her Aristocratic upbringing, Stanley investigates, through a friend travelling in Mississippi, why his emotionally disturbed, alcoholic, child molesting sister-in-law was fired from her job and kicked out of her boarding house. A telling interlude has Stanley striking Stella for interfering with his treatment of Blanche. She escapes to the upstairs apartment of her landlady (Peg Hillias), but is so dependent upon Stanley that she returns to him when he goes into the yard and calls for her to come back. Things do not go well for Blanche when Stella goes to the hospital to give birth to her child just after a teenage boy accuses her of making improper advances when he came to her door to collect money for Stanley's periodical subscription and Mitch dumps her. There is surrealistic moment, to be individually sorted out by each viewer, when Blanche insists she is going to cut up Stanley's face with the jagged edges of a broken liquor bottle and then insists he is going to rape her. The play and the movie cuts from the blackout to a scene some time later when Stella is putting her baby to sleep in the front yard, Stanley is having his card game over, and authorities arrive from the local mental institution to put Blanche away for life.The landlady calls Stella to the bathroom, where Blanche is soaking up her cares in another hot water tub and wants the ladies to dress her in her faded, fake finery so a nonexistent gentleman friend can escort her on a nonexistent world cruise.

Amid the small talk Scott tells the men that he is a reporter looking for a story. One of the officers admits that a large number of scientists are at the North Pole. Scotty takes an interest in the matter but nothing more is said.Captain Patrick Hendry (Kenneth Tobey) is paged to General Fogarty's quarters. Fogarty explains that a strange aircraft has been found at the pole, Hendry is put in charge of the recovery mission. Remembering the earlier conversation he asks if Scott can fly up with the recovery team.Arriving at the pole they meet with the scientists who are excited about the potential of the find. Hendry catches up with a science assistant Nikki Nicholson (Margaret Sheridan). It is clear from their encounter they have an extensive social past.Nikki introduces Hendry to Dr. Arthur Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite) leader of the scientist based at the north pole. Carrington tells Hendry the crashed aircraft is located about 48 miles from the base. When the vehicle crashed instruments recorded an explosion and magnetic flux disturbance that indicates the object weighs approximately 20,000 tons.Hendry suggests that, given the recorded weight of the vessel, they must be dealing with a meteor. Carrington, however, shows him a number of radar tracks that show the object changed course and speed a number of times before crashing.The expedition flies to the location to begin to unravel the mystery, as they approach the reported location the aircraft's compass begins to malfunction then Geiger counters begin registering erratic levels of radiation. Finally they see a teardrop-shaped area of ice in the snow.Arriving at the actual crash site they realize whatever landed was so hot that it melted enough snow to sink down so that only a stabilizer fin protrudes. To establish the actual size of the craft the team slowly spreads out over the object. After a few moments it becomes obvious the craft is circular. ""We finally got one"" exclaims a scientist, believing they have just located a UFO.Thermite bombs are used to melt the ice around the craft, unfortunately something in the metal used to build the ship reacts to the Thermite and the scientist look on in horror as the whole vehicle disintegrates destroying all evidence of the ship. A minute later, second object is found in the ice near the remains of the spaceship and on closer investigation they believe it may have been the pilot of the ship. Not willing to risk using Thermite again, they cut the creature out of the ice and make plans to transport the complete block of ice back to base.At the base, Hendry refuses to allow the scientists to defrost the block before he's checked in with his superiors -- after the destruction of the ship he doesn't intend to take any more chances. He also has a concern about potential disease that may be carried by the creature, or what could happen once the creature's body is exposed to Earth's atmosphere.To secure the block Hendry moves it to a storeroom then breaks the windows to stop any possibility of the ice melting. Hendry sets watches at 4 hour intervals. The first watch is stood by Lt. Ken ""Mac"" Macpherson (Robert Nichols). The base radioman, Corporal Barnes (William Self) reports that the weather has cut the base off from communication with the outside world. He cannot receive messages but thinks he might still be able to send.Hendry gives him a report on the situation, as well as a request from the scientists to examine the creature. Later that night Barnes reports he got through and has received instructions. Scotty is frustrated that someone in Washington has leaked the story, and although he is the only reporter at the base, no one can hear his version. General Fogerty has also forwarded Hendry's report to the highest levels of government, and is waiting for further instructions.Everyone standing watch on the creature is becoming badly spooked. The ice block has become a little transparent and the creature's face can be seen. The eyes give the impression the creature is still alive, Hendry adjusts the watch from four to two hours.The base settles in for the night and Nikki confides in Hendry that she is unsure about what to make out of the situation. She also compliments Hendry on his handling of the situation; she then offers to buy him a drink. They retire to her office and the obvious attraction begins to flower, ending in a steamy kiss and admission of mutual feelings for each other.Back at the storage room, Barnes has taken over the watch on the creature. The creature's appearance has him spooked and not thinking, he throws an electric blanket over the block of ice causing it to defrost unnoticed. Distracted by the novel he is reading, Barnes doesn't notice movement behind him before it is too late. Jumping to his feet he draws and fires his pistol as he retreats from the storage room.Somewhat hysterical, Barnes reports to Hendry and the scientists that the creature is alive and it chased him. Hendry and the group return to the room to find the hollowed out block of ice and creature gone. Through a broken window they can hear a battle going on between the camp dogs and the creature. The men race to the aid of the dogs, but the creature escapes.The scientists discover an arm of the creature torn off during the attack. The scientists begin inspecting the arm. They discover the arm is made of chitin and laced with barbs and they suspect this makes the creature amazingly strong. The arm also appears to have no nerves and the cellular structure is identical to vegetable matter.Dr. Carrington, having found seed pods attached to the creature's arms, surmises that on its home planet, plants rather than animals evolved into intelligent beings. As the debate continues the arm begins to move by itself. Carrington theorizes that some of the frozen blood from one of the huskies had thawed and was absorbed into the arm, causing temporary re-animation. Although surprised, he thinks this is caused by various parts of the creature being able to become independent organisms.Hendry is concerned the creature may re-enter the base. Everyone is armed with guns and axes and a search begins. At the greenhouse, Carrington notices something wrong with some molds near the back door of the greenhouse. After the soldiers leave, Carrington points out to his colleagues that a number of the most temperature-sensitive plants have died, probably from exposure to cold air. They conclude that the back door to the greenhouse had been open for a short time, allowing a blast of cold air inside. Searching the room they discover the body of a dog in a small storage container, drained of blood. The creature had been there and had fed on the dog. He asks the scientists to watch the room that night without telling Hendry.Having swept the base, Hendry searches outside. As they discuss their plans to find the creature, Dr. Stern, badly injured, staggers into the room and faints. He explains that two scientists have been attacked and killed in the greenhouse. Stern adds that he saw the bodies of his comrades hanging from rafters with their throats slit.Hendry races to the greenhouse and orders the door opened. He is immediately attacked by the alien. Hendry slams the door shut briefly on the creature's arm, which has regenerated. One of his officers shoots through the door before the team shores it up to stop the creature breaking into the rest of the base. Hendry scolds Carrington for sacrificing the lives of his comrades -- when the door was open, Hendry saw them hanging from the ceiling just like Chapman described.Carrington later quietly gathers the remaining scientists and explains the situation. The alien is intelligent and he believes it intends to reproduce. He then shows them an experiment he's set up. Taking a number of seeds from the creature's severed arm, he's planted them and fed them a diet of blood from the stores in the infirmary. Within four hours the seeds had sprouted and were continuing to grow quickly into small pulsating pods. Using a stethoscope he believes he can hear the plants wailing like new born children looking for food. Some of the scientists are repulsed by Carrington's actions and try to convince him to tell Hendry. He refuses believing only the scientists should handle the situation. Carrington is also convinced that they can communicate with the creature.Nikki finds Hendry and shows him Carrington's notes. Hendry realizes this explains a secondary issue they have had: to find the basic blood supply that is needed to treat Stern for his injuries, Stern is receiving blood from volunteers who provided some of their blood for transfusions. Hendry confronts Carrington, who refuses to buckle and stop the experiment. Hendry wants the plants destroyed and the creature trapped and destroyed in the greenhouse. A message from Fogerty interrupts the exchange, he has instructed all efforts must be made to keep the alien alive. Carrington sees this as validation for his actions.Deciding Fogarty is not in full understanding of what is happening at the base, Hendry decides to ignore the General's instructions. He gathers all the military personnel in the mess hall to consider options. They agree on an idea of dousing the creature with kerosene and lighting it, hopefully cooking the alien. Nikki points out one of the Geiger counters has begun to react. It means the creature is on the move and if the readings are correct, heading for the mess hall.Everyone scrambles to get ready as the alien bursts into the room. They successfully ignite the kerosene and set the Thing on fire, but the creature escapes outside, using the snow to douse the flames. Scotty, wanting to take a picture of the monster, fails to do so when he trips over a nearby bunk. Regrouping the men decide to repeat the attack, only this time using a lot more kerosene. However, the method proves to be more dangerous since they burned out nearly a whole room and the effort failed to kill the monster.The creature shows its intelligence by cutting the oil flow to the heating system. Hendry believes the creature is trying to set its own trap. Anyone who attempts to repair the oil line will be ambushed and killed. Hendry thinks if this fails the creature will next attack the power generators. One of the other scientists recommends a more effective and safer trap using electricity from wires strung from the rafters of the camp's main tunnel & a grating placed under the wooden pallets covering the floor.Frantic preparations ensue as the men build barricades to force the creature to approach from a specific direction. Almost as soon as they are finished one of the men reports movement near his barricade. The creature moves off and then begins attacking in the direction needed to trigger the trap.Suddenly the lights go out and Nikki shouts that Carrington has cut the power, Carrington is quickly overpowered and power is restored.Carrington furiously rushes towards the creature and tries to explain to it that humans are intelligent and that both species could learn from each other. The creature seems completely unimpressed with the encounter and swats Carrington away before once again advancing menacingly. Hendry sees his chance and springs the trap as electrical bolts hit the Thing. The creature struggles briefly before being reduced to a small pile of ash. Nothing is recognizable; no evidence is left to show the threat from space ever existed. Even Scotty, too overwhelmed by the incident, was unable to take a picture and he faints.A little later, the men are gathered and going over what's been accomplished. Carrington is alive and only mildly injured. The men report that all Carrington's notes have been destroyed along with the alien arm and all the seedlings.With things settling down Nikki corners Hendry and discusses the possibility of taking their friendship a step further and would he consider settling down. He seems to suggest he might and they go to a corner to discuss their future.The radio is now transmitting and receiving clearly, Scott takes the opportunity to send his story to the assembled newsmen back in Anchorage. After recapping events he ends his broadcast with a chilling note. ""Watch the skies, everywhere, keep looking, and keep watching the skies."""
tt0044207,"['Action', 'SciFi', 'Thriller']","David Randall (Richard Derr), free-lance pilot and incurable womanizer, lands near the Mount Kennah Observatory in South Africa, to take a secret package, contents unknown (and chained to his wrist), to the Cosmos Observatory of Dr. Cole Hendron (Larry Keating). Dr. Emery Bronson (Hayden Rorke) orders his staff not to tell Randall what he's carrying. But when Randall demands advance payment, Bronson, in telling him that Herndon will pay him on delivery, advises him that a day might come, and that sooner than he thinks, when money is the least of his concerns. (He also gives Randall several pictures of Hendron for identification.)Randall is cheerfully confident that when that day comes, he will be dead. But he does not sell out the package to the newspapers that offer him several times his fee; at least he has *some* ethics. He tears up the radiograms that reach his flight, and lands at Idlewild Airport in New York on schedule. There Joyce Hendron (Barbara Rush) meets him and takes him to the observatory. Again the reporter from the New York Sentinel tries to buy the package, but Randall, smitten with Joyce, refuses.On the way to the observatory, Joyce babbles about the package, assuming, incorrectly, that Randall knows everything. Randall plays along, and is shocked to hear this lovely woman say how frightened she is of the end of the world! His curiosity having hooked him thoroughly, he keeps his appointment at the observatory, where he meets Dr. Anthony Drake (Peter Hanson), a physician, and Dr. Hendron. Randall confirms Hendron's identity and allows Hendron to unlock the package from him and open it.The package contains a number of photographic plates, plus the coordinates and vectors of two new astronomical bodies, a rogue star and its single satellite, that are on a collision course with the earth. Sadly, the coordinates and vectors check out, and reveal the horrible truth: the rogue star (Bellus) and its planet (Zyra), approaching from the direction of Scorpio, will enter the solar system within six months. Zyra will pass close to earth, close enough to affect tides and earthquake belts. Nineteen days later, Bellus will crash into the earth and destroy both bodies.Numbed with this realization, Randall collects his fee in cash, and then spends most of his time at an expensive restaurant, burning it, bill by bill, in the fire of the fondue set at the next table. Most of the guests think he's crazy--but not Joyce Hendron, who breaks off from dancing with her fianc√©, Dr. Drake, to sit with Randall and keep him company. In fact, Joyce Hendron fell in love with Randall, probably when they met at Idlewild, and certainly now, when they share a terrible secret.Unaware of this complication, Dr. Hendron and his colleague, Dr. George Frye (Stephen Chase), present their findings to the United Nations Security Council. With the result that the assembled Ambassadors laugh them out of Turtle Bay. (The problem: other astronomers simply dispute the Herndon-Bronson findings.) They then go to the United States Congress, which likewise refuses to fund what they want to build: giant space lifeboats to lift a limited number of human beings, livestock and equipment to Zyra before Bellus crashes into the earth. But though Congress won't appropriate any funds, two industrialists donate funds and land for the establishment of a construction camp to build at least one of the space arks. The money is not even close to sufficient, of course, but an embittered millionaire, Sydney Stanton (John Hoyt), agrees to finance the project. He at first demands the right to select the ark's passengers and crew; Herndon refuses, and eventually wins his financing by offering Stanton one thing only: his own passage on the ark.(Before his meeting with Stanton, Joyce goes to Herndon and confesses that she does not love Drake anymore, and has feelings for Randall instead. Herndon firmly tells her *not* to marry *any* man whom she does not love, and offers to find any excuse to keep David Randall on his staff.)Construction, and the selection of large construction and preparation crews, begin. (Prominent everywhere are signs reading, ""Waste anything except TIME. Time is our shortest material."") Preparation includes converting a large selection of books to microfilm to establish a library, and the gathering of crop seeds and livestock. From the 600 members of the project, Herndon will later select forty at random. Everyone understands this, but no one says anything--yet--about the implications. With two possible exceptions: Julie Cummings (Rachel Ames) and Eddie Garson (James Congdon), who have fallen in love on the bus taking them to the camp.Tony Drake has not realized Joyce' feelings for Randall, and Joyce' aloof attitude puzzles him. He has little time to think about that, however. After all, Zyra will pass close to earth in 88 days, with Bellus striking earth 19 days later. (In fact, the project junks the old Gregorian calendar in favor of a very simple double calendar, counting the days to the Zyra and Bellus encounters.) Stanton orders a box of guns brought to camp, predicting that at the last minute, the non-selected personnel will likely attack the ship to fight for seats off-planet.With the continued approach of Zyra-Bellus, the authorities now realize that Herndon was right, and now preparation is too late. As the Secretary of Defense prepares to implement martial law in America, Joyce continues to woo Randall. But she does not realize that Randall has already decided to stay behind. The reason: as an airplane pilot, he would have a skill set that would be utterly useless in the founding of a new civilization that would begin as a farming village only. Why take him, when they could take more livestock instead? Joyce is heartbroken, but determined to win him over, somehow, someway.Martial law begins, along with evacuation of all coastal areas. St. Peter's Square in Vatican City fills to standing-room only with the faithful.Finally, at about 1:00 p.m. on Z-Day, Zyra makes its close pass. The resulting earthquakes cause fires and other damage that threaten the ship. Randall leads a massive effort to shore up the ship's launch track--but then a crane falls, killing some of the senior scientists. The other damage is minor, and the space ark and its launch track remain intact, but now no doubt remains. Elsewhere on earth, tsunamis wash over the cities, and massive flooding occurs everywhere.Drake and Randall take off together to drop some medical supplies for some nearby evacuees. In the process, they take off a small boy who has climbed to the rooftop of his house and finds himself stranded. At first Drake tries to leave Randall behind--but then his conscience gets hold of him and he returns to take Randall off. They return, and now Drake has reconciled himself to losing Joyce to Randall and decided to accept Randall as a friend.Randall, however, is still not convinced that he has any business taking passage aboard the ark. So with Bellus 11 days away, when Herndon holds a lottery draw for the selection process, Randall pretends to take a number, and then puts it back. In short, Randall is refusing passage, though Herndon strenuously tries to persuade him to accept.With Bellus five days away, Drake notices how distracted Joyce really is. So the next day Drake goes looking for Randall, and finds him checking out the cockpit cameras aboard the ark. Drake then tells Randall that Frye, the designated pilot, has a heart condition that could kill him during the blackout phase of the launch, and therefore the ark *must* have a copilot, and Randall is the only man who can so serve on such short notice. Elated to find himself with such a vital role after all, Randall rushes to tell Joyce that he will accept passage (and, presumably, training as Frye's copilot).With Bellus two days away, the rescued boy, whom Herndon has already granted passage, now asks for passage for a stray dog he has adopted. Drake and Joyce weigh the dog (finding out that the dog is female) and agree to take the dog and off-load two chickens.On the final day, Herndon publishes the winning numbers. Eddie Gaston makes the cut, but Julie Cummings does not. A heartbroken Eddie turns his number in. Unknown to him, he has broken into an argument among Herndon, Frye, and Stanton, who wants another person to sacrifice his seat to give the ark a greater chance. In the middle of the heated argument, Stanton's personal assistant, Harold Ferris (Frank Cady), tries to shoot Stanton, but Stanton kills him instead. Randall walks in and orders Stanton to surrender his weapon to him. He then suggests that the women board the ark first, then the livestock, with the men to board last. Frye, on his own authority as captain of the ark, gives orders to grant Julie Cummings passage anyway and gamble that the ark's fuel will still suffice.Now with Bellus less than an hour away, the selected passengers don the cold-weather gear they will wear on Zyra and board the ark. Herndon asures Frye that he will bring Stanton on board last. But in the main bunker, the remaining personnel steal Stanton's guns and try to storm the ark. But a high fence keeps them at bay, so they cannot get close, though they start shooting at the ark. Herndon now reveals that he never intended to take passage, nor allow it to Stanton either. He pushes Stanton's wheelchair away from the boarding ramp, and then uncovers and throws a secret lever that closes the ark's hatch and releases the ark. Stanton desperately lurches to his feet, but to no avail.The ark goes down the slide, then turns up, under full drive, its passengers watching Bellus crash into the earth as they pass before they all black out. Minutes later they all come out of their stupor--including Frye, leading Randall to realize that Drake deliberately exaggerated the health hazard to Frye just to persuade Randall to come aboard. Randall has no more time to think about that, because he and Frye have their hands full with piloting the ark to an intercept with Zyra, and then to a safe re-entry. They run out of fuel after they complete re-entry, so that Randall must glide the ark in--but happily the ark comes down in a deep snow field. Drake wants Randall to wait to let him sample the air, but Randall insists on opening the hatch anyway, as if the air is not breathable, they would die of suffocation anyway. Happily, not only is the air breathable, but at lower altitudes Zyra is green and lush. The passengers disembark (together with the dog and her litter of pups) and take the livestock with them. Last to disembark are Randall and Joyce, who walk down the ramp, hand in hand."

Professor Jacob ten Brinken [Erich von Stroheim], to ask for money so that he can continue his
studies. His uncle is not home, but Frank is surprised to see a beautiful
young girl seated on the railing of a second story porch at the top of a
trellis. When Frank asks about the girl, the servant denies that they have
any guests and tells Frank to come back tomorrow to talk with his uncle.
But Frank doesn't want to wait until tomorrow. He tells his friends RalphGoutram [Rolf Henniger]
and Gerald [Harry Meyenrin] about the girl; the three of them decide to investigate. They
return to search the estate. Ralph and Gerald both catch glimpses of the
girl, but it is Frank who finally catches up with her. She invites him to
meet her the next day at 3 PM near the sundial.In fact, it was about this girl that ten Brinken had gone away. She
is his daughter Alraune [Hildegard Knef], and she ran away from the convent school. Not
that the Mother Superior is unhappy about Alraune leaving. Alraune has a
reputation at the convent of causing trouble. She reads ""obscene
literature,"" and she incites the other girls to do nasty things, even
though Alraune herself always comes out blameless. Good riddance, she says.When Frank finally gets to see his uncle, ten Brinken refuses to give
him the money for his studies, so Frank goes to see an old family friend,
Princess Wolkonski [Trude Hesterberg]. The Princess has eyes on Frank as a husband for her
daughter Olga [Julia Koschka], so the Princess offers to loan Frank the money he needs to
continue his medical studies on the provision that he study at the
Sorbonne in Paris (she wants to keep him away from Alraune). She also
explains to Frank that his uncle was once a medical doctor, but he was
expelled from the university for conducting unusual experiments. She
thinks it's for this reason that ten Brinken doesn't like young Frank, who
is studying to become a doctor.The next day, Frank meets Alraune at the sundial. They profess their
love for each other. When Frank informs Alraune that he'll be leaving
tomorrow for Paris, Alraune is extremely pleased and tells Frank that she
will accompany him. They arrange to meet the next day at the sundial. When
ten Brinken learns about Frank's meeting with Alraune, he changes his mind
about the loan. But Frank refuses the money and tells ten Brinken of his
love for Alraune, so ten Brinken tells Frank the truth about her. He gives
Frank a diary in which he describes the circumstances surrounding her
birth. Aided by Princess Wolkonski, ten Brinken artificially impregnated a
seedy prostitute with the sperm from a murderer about to be hanged.
Alraune, he says, already shows evidence of the evil characteristics of
her true parents.Horrified by the truth of Alraune's ancestry, Frank leaves for Paris
that night and fails to meet Alraune as planned. Letters that Alraune
sends to Frank come back ""refused"". Feeling betrayed by Frank, Alraune
begins to live up to her legacy. First, she suggests that her father buy a
seemingly worthless tract of land, but when they ride out to survey the
land, they uncover a sulfur spring, spouting water that can be developed
into a successful health spa. Olga comes to stay with the ten Brinkens
while her mother travels to Paris. When Olga receives a letter from her
mother regarding Olga's engagement to Frank, Alraune convinces Olga that
no man who really loved her would send his love through his fiancee's
mother, so Olga attempts suicide by poison.Alraune takes to flirting with men who are infatuated with her. She
goes horseback riding in a rainstorm with Gerald. She goes riding in a
carriage with the coachman Mathieu [Hans Cossy]. She poses for Ralph so that he can
paint her. When one of Alraune's necklaces comes up missing and is found
in the luggage of her governess, Mlle Duvaliere [Denise Vernac], Alraune requests that
Mlle be dismissed. Later she learns that it was Dr Mohn [Harry Halm] who took the key
to Alraune's jewelry box, stole the necklace, and planted it in Mlle's
luggage, all to gain Alraune's favor. Frank returns from Paris with his
doctorate, but still he refuses to have anything to do with Alraune.
Distraught by Frank's continued coldness towards her, Alraune tires of her
conquests, and they begin to die. Mathieu's carriage runs over a cliff.
Ralph catches pneumonia and dies. Gerald dies in a duel with Dr Mohn.No man seems to make Alraune happy. Alraune herself wonders whether
she is capable of loving and seems motivated by only one thing -- Frank
Braun. She begs Frank to help her. When Frank sees Alraune cry, he
realizes that everything he was told about her was untrue...she does have
feelings for others, she has a heart, she has a soul. Frank takes Alraune
in his arms, and they plan to go away together. Alraune tells her father
about her love for Frank, but ten Brinken refuses to let her go. Instead,
he gives her the diary and tells her to read about her parents. He warns
her that, if she goes away with Frank, she will destroy him, too, just as
surely as she destroyed the others. Alraune decides not to go away with
Frank.Days pass. Dr Mohn threatens to go public with ten Brinken's illegal
experiments. Ten Brinken plans to take his money and move away from
Germany with Alraune. Princess Wolkonski worries that revealing ten
Brinken's secrets will ruin her, too. Frank can think of nothing other
than Alraune. Together, Frank and the Princess go to see the ten Brinkens.
While the Princess argues with ten Brinken, Frank pursues Alraune through
the snow. Alraune keeps seeing images of her dead suitors, and she faints.
When she comes to, Frank tells her that he loves her and tries to convince
her that she had nothing to do with the deaths, but Alraune sees herself
as the bringer of destruction because she is nothing more than a horrible
experiment, brought into being by the evil thoughts of a depraved man.
Frank assures her that both good and evil are passed into each individual
and that the good in Alraune can win over the evil. The evil thing is that
she was brought up without love. Whoever is brought up without love is
sick, Frank moralizes.As Frank carries Alraune back towards the house, her father pulls out
a gun and shoots her. Alraune dies, and ten Brinken is hanged. [Original

tt0044391,"['Drama', 'Romance']","Three much-sought-after people in Hollywood--a director, an actress, and a writer--each receive transatlantic calls from one Jonathan Shields. Each one refuses to talk to him. Yet when mutual friend Harry Pebbel asks them to meet him in Jonathan Shields' old office at the Shields studio, they agree, and even agree to share their grievances with Harry. Harry tells them that after two years of financial reorganization, Jonathan wants to produce a picture, and he wants the three to participate in it.Fred Amiel, the director, speaks first, having met Jonathan Shields eighteen years ago:Fred Amiel accepts a promise of eleven dollars to attend the funeral of producer Hugo Shields--but once there, he can't resist muttering jibes about the elder Shields under his breath. He doesn't know, of course, that he is standing right next to Hugo's son Jonathan. Jonathan tells him straight out that he didn't act like a mourner, so he won't be paid. Later that day, Fred goes to see Jonathan to apologize. Jonathan asks him to stay, and the two talk of their frustrations and dreams.For years they get by on what they make by making quickie Westerns on Poverty Row--and then Jonathan proposes to raise a stake to get into a poker game with noted B-movie executive producer Harry Pebbel. Fred and his friends raise the stake, and Jonathan proceeds to run up a debt of over $6,000--to Harry. Jonathan goes to Harry and makes a deal: Harry hires Jonathan, and Jonathan will pay Harry back. Harry does hire Jonathan, and asks him, ""Just bring me a picture I can shoot.""So for a few more years Jonathan produces, and Fred directs, several B movies for Harry. But when Harry assigns them to make a horror flick featuring five men dressed like cats, Jonathan substitutes his own ideas. The result is the best reception that a Harry Pebbel sneak preview has gotten yet. After the preview, Jonathan takes Fred to see the home of an actor named George Lorrison. There Jonathan cuts out a piece of loose wallpaper holding a drawing made by Lorrison of Hugo Shields, depicting him as the devil. They also meet the very resentful Georgia Lorrison--and Jonathan, despite her bitter manner, is fascinated with her.The next day, Jonathan and Fred get their next assignment: a sequel to the B movie they just made. Fred balks, and shows Jonathan his outline for a movie based on a novel that three studios have refused to adapt for film. Jonathan pitches it to Harry, and at first Harry refuses, and then tells Jonathan to go ahead and make the film and take the consequences if it fails. Jonathan and Fred polish their outline, and after Fred directs twelve disastrous screen tests for a leading man, the two agree to approach Victor ""Gaucho"" Ribera, a much-sought-after Latin actor. Gaucho agrees, and suddenly Harry has arranged for a million-dollar budget, a Vera Cruz location--and a director other than Fred Amiel. Fred, outraged, accuses Jonathan of stealing his idea--and that is why Fred resents Jonathan.After listening to that story, Harry reminds Fred that all that Jonathan did was to force Fred to make his own way--and, a happy marriage and family and two Oscars later, he ought to realize that Jonathan helped rather than hurt him.Georgia Lorrison speaks next:Five years after the encounter with Jonathan in her father's broken-down house, Georgia is a drunk and a tramp playing bit parts around town. Jonathan Shields casts her in a bit role and then surprises her by appearing in her apartment when she comes home at four a.m. Jonathan asks her to do a screen test for him, and then roars at her to stop living in the past and learn to laugh at live, as her father used to. Georgia goes through the test, which is atrocious, but Jonathan insists that she has star quality and casts her in a leading role anyway.Although he supports her in every way--even telling a worried costumer, ""Miss Lorrison will hold herself like Miss Lorrison!""--the night before shooting is to start, she goes on a bender and vanishes. Jonathan agrees to let Harry Pebbel (who now works for him) sound out the talent agents for another actress, but when press agent Syd Murphy lets slip that Georgia often locks her door for days at a time, Jonathan rushes to her apartment, kicks in the door, and finds Georgia in the one place no one thought to look. He takes her back to his estate, where he throws her into a pool to shock her out of her fog, and then accepts her professions of love for him. He then tells Harry by telephone, ""I know just how to handle her now.""Shooting is by turns an ecstatic and a grueling time, made worse by Jonathan's perfectionism and endless retakes. But eventually the shooting gets done, and Georgia gets to have her first opening-night party with herself as the honoree. But Jonathan is not there--so she goes to visit him at his home. And there she discovers that Jonathan has taken a lover--a truly cheap woman who snidely says, ""You're business; I'm company."" Jonathan bellows at her that she hasn't the right to decide what he's like, and throws her out of his house--whereupon she gets into her car, drives into a heavy driving rain, and almost crashes until she finds the presence of mind to pull over and stop.Harry Pebbel gently reminds her of the day that she broke her contract--a legally actionable act that Jonathan did not sue her for--and of the millions of dollars that she since made for another studio--where Fred Amiel has been the star director.James Lee Bartlow now tells his own story:James Lee Bartlow, professor of history at the University of Virginia, has sold a novel about early Virginia history. He is surprised at its brisk sale, and even more surprised when Hollywood buys it, and Jonathan Shields himself calls him and offers him an expenses-paid trip to Hollywood. At first James Lee refuses, but his wife Rosemary wants the trip so much that he goes anyway. There James Lee is very much impressed by Jonathan, in spite of himself, and eventually he finds himself signed on with Shields Productions to write a screen treatment of his novel. But whenever he tries to get any work done, Rosemary always interrupts him with a wish to see some tourist trap or other.Finally, Jonathan has had enough, and he asks his old friend Gaucho to ""squire"" Rosemary around town, while he and James Lee take off for a cabin on a lake so that they can work without interruption. The treatment completed, Jonathan and James Lee return--and then James Lee reads the shocking news that Gaucho and Rosemary have died in a plane crash. Syd Murphy suppresses the flight plan that clearly shows that Gaucho was flying Rosemary to Acapulco to get a quickie divorce. Jonathan denies any knowledge of the affair that Gaucho and Rosemary were having, and insists that James Lee get to work on writing the script.With the script finished, James Lee tries to interest Georgia Lorrison in it, but she refuses--and also denies his suggestion that she is still in love with Jonathan. Then, four days into shooting, Jonathan has a falling-out with the director and decides to direct the film himself. The result is a disaster, and Jonathan, mortified, orders the picture shelved, though this means bankruptcy. James Lee offers to have Jonathan join him in another mountain retreat while James Lee writes his second novel--but in that conversation, Jonathan lets slip that he tried to stop Gaucho from making the fatal airplane flight. James Lee punches Jonathan in the jaw, and Jonathan, refusing to retaliate, insists that Rosemary had been a fool who wasted James Lee's time and wasted James Lee himself.James Lee perhaps has the best reason to resent Jonathan, but Harry still reminds James Lee that the professor does, after all, have a Pulitzer Prize under his belt and is now the most sought-after writer in Hollywood.Jonathan Shields is now on the line from Paris, France, and Harry asks the three straight-out whether they will participate or not. They refuse, and leave the office. But Jonathan will not stop talking, even though a transatlantic telephone call costs a fortune. Outside, Georgia, true to her habit, picks up on the other extension and starts to listen--and not long after that, all three are listening to Jonathan's pitch."

tt0044502,"['Drama', 'FilmNoir', 'Romance']","First viewed Clash by Night on 5/30/10 on TCM. Very good script from a play by Clifford Odets. What stood out were the parallels with A Streetcar Named Desire. Stanwyk plays the Blanche part as Mae Doyle, but she is much tougher than Blanche. Robert Ryan is excellent in the part of Earl Pfeiffer. He is direct in his approach to Mae and sees through her just as Stanley saw through Blanche. Unlike Stanley, Earl eventually reveals his vulnerability and desparate loneliness, making him and Mae (in his opinion) two of a kind. Mae is interesting because of the demands she makes on life; her past is one of dreams that didn't work out, Although the plot development is fairly predictable, there are some twists and some very good dramatic dialogue.

Robert and Ann have to go to meet an elderly lady, an old friend of the family who is not expected to live long. The old lady is in hospital and sees Ann alone, and approves of her but refers to ""poor"" Robert: he has been so much alone, and he is an orphan. Ann says that she too is an orphan.
The old lady says that Robert has been alone ever since he was a child; the three aunts who now live with him are evidently not a positive influence. She tells Ann not to let Robert take her to Crow Hollow, saying it's no good to either of them. However the old lady is too ill to continue and Ann has to leave before she can explain.
Robert and Ann drive to Crow Hollow, which Ann has never seen. She thinks the house is lovely, and indeed it looks like an old manor house. As they pull up, Aunt Judith is pottering about outside and Robert calls her over. She is friendly towards Ann, and explains that she is a naturalist, and has just received an unusual spider from Australia as a zoological specimen.
Robert and Ann go indoors and Aunt Opal is introduced; she too is friendly and compliments Ann on her looks, albeit rather intrusively. Aunt Hester is out at present. Aunt Opal takes them to the main bedroom, but she seems to have a habit of making gloomy remarks; this leads to her impress on Ann that ""It's where our dear Mother died.""
Opal tells Robert that a patient needs a home visit, and Ann realises that his medical duty takes precedence. Is he more conscientious as a doctor than as a conscientious husband, she asks. She goes down to the sitting room and the third aunt, Hester, has returned. Hester too makes a personal remark about Ann's slimness, and the ladies as well as Robert himself have a marked tendency to say ""Nonsense"" when Ann makes any observation herself. It now emerges that Willow is in the house, and Robert has brought a present for her. Ann asks who Willow is, but Robert dodges answering the question.
Ann and Robert will now sleep in the main bedroom, but Opal shows Ann the bedroom where Robert had slept hitherto. Ann says she prefers the room; couldn't they move in there? When that idea is turned down, they look at a painted portrait of Robert's Mother; Ann likes it and asks if they could have it in the bedroom they are using, but that request too is brushed aside. Now Opal takes Ann to another room; she hopes Ann will like it. Ann says it is lovely, but it now emerges it is Willow's room. Who is Willow? Well, she is a sort of companion, but ""we always treat her as one of the family"".
Later Ann is trying to be dutifully happy; Robert is strangely melancholy, but doesn't properly explain why.
Ann is in bed and someone is knocking at the door. Instead of answering it she reads a note on her pillow; Robert has had to go out on a call. The knocking is persistent, so Ann asks the knocker to come in; it turns out to be Willow, who is dressed as a housemaid; she is a strikingly good-looking young woman. She has brought Ann breakfast. Willow is very direct in her manner, although she calls Ann ""Miss"". Willow is wearing a necklace Robert has bought her, and she now takes an interest in Ann's clothes that are being unpacked. Nevertheless, she makes a disparaging remark about Ann's wedding outfit. Ann makes a tart reply, but Willow seems unabashed.
Alone the next day, Ann goes to see the place in the outhouses where Judith keeps her zoological specimens. Again Judith is friendly enough and she pointedly asks Ann whether she likes the household. Ann evades answering, and Judith says that before Ann came, they had a discussion whether she would be better looking than Willow.
Judith shows Ann the newly arrived live spider; it is very large and it looks like a bird-eating spider, but Ann doesn't really like spiders. Ann now goes to see Mr Dexter, the gardener; he is very friendly, and he warns Ann not to let the aunts bully her. Hester bustles in with a bottle of strychnine, which she says she uses to protect the carrots in the garden from rabbits. Dexter tells Hester she should be careful with the strychnine. Robert is out making calls, so Hester invites Ann to join her in the village, where she is going to distribute her soup. Evidently she considers it to have health-giving powers to local people.
Ann goes to the room to get a coat, and discovers Willow there; she is dressed in Ann's clothes. Ann had only said she could look at them, and was offended that Willow had taken the liberty. Declining to apologise, Willow now asks Ann if she was telling the truth when she previously said that the clothes were fashionable: they seem kind of plain, she says.
In town with Hester, Ann goes to see Robert at his surgery. She persuades him to go to lunch with her, and she complains that the aunts are rather oppressive. Robert says this is utter nonsense. She explains that she is unhappy, and says why, but he brushes her concerns aside. She asks if they could move to another house, but he evades answering and flatly contradicts her feeling of unhappiness.
There is to be a dance later in the week and they will go; in the sitting room Ann's favourite dress is brought out, and Judith lays down a box containing the spider next to some flowers. Upstairs in her room Willow is setting Ann's hair, and suggests she could wear the flowers in her hair, and Ann agrees. Ann fishes for Willow to explain whether she has a romantic interest locally, but Willow ignores the enquiry and starts to put the flowers in Ann's hair. A spider falls out and lodges on Ann's bare shoulder. She screams, and Willow runs to get Robert; the spider is dislodged and Robert kills it. Judith insists that the spider was in a box with a lid and could not have simply escaped on its own.
There is a fruitless discussion about how the spider could have got there, and Robert eventually asks the other women to leave. Willow was holding the dress that Ann was to wear, and throws it down contemptuously on the bed. Robert is superficially sympathetic, but is entirely dismissive of Ann's concern that someone means her ill.
They go to the dance, and Ann is introduced to Diana Wilson; it was her mother who warned Ann about Crow Hollow just before she died in hospital. Ann asks Diana if she knows what her Mother's warning against Crow Hollow meant. Diana doesn't really know, but mentions that the aunts at Crow Hill had more or less stolen the old lady's maid: Willow. Diana says that Willow was bribed by the Aunts to go there. She was adopted; the two women agree that Willow is possibly devious, and Diana hints that Robert might have become romantically involved with her.
Later Robert and Ann have a discussion about Crow Hollow; Ann is desperately unhappy at the situation, and as before Robert is dismissive and evades even addressing Ann's wishes. However Robert discloses that he promised his grandfather that he would live at Crow Hollow and allow the three aunts to live there, and for that reason he can't simply go to live elsewhere.
In the sitting room later the Aunts are discussing Marguerite, Robert's Mother, when Anne walks in. The discussion turns sour, implying petty hostilities. Willow comes in and asks Opal if she can have the day off tomorrow, and Opal agrees without consulting Ann, further emphasising that Ann is not mistress of the house.
As Ann leaves the room, the gardener Dexter comes in and shows Anne a deadly poisonous toadstool he has found, and which he proposes to give to Judith. They go in to the kitchen, and Dexter puts the toadstool down. Dexter tells Anne that the Aunts were displeased when Robert's parents got married. His mother died in the house of a mysterious fever. Anne later looks at her gravestone in the churchyard and sees that she died at the age of 26. It is raining hard in the churchyard, and Anne gets wet through.
When Robert comes home she asks him what his Mother died of, and asks if she was very unhappy at Crow Hollow. He sidesteps both questions, and is concerned that Ann may have got a chill. He insists, against her wishes, that she goes to bed. She falls asleep and wakes much later; Opal comes and says that Robert has gone out to attend to a medical case; and she adds that Ann must be hungry; she will see if Hester has got some soup ready. In fact Hester arrives at once with some soup. Ann starts to eat it, but finds it bitter. Hester says that is nonsense; it's a very bland soup. She leaves, but Ann almost immediately suffers a severe vomiting attack.
Later Robert and the aunts are round Ann's bed; Ann mentions the toadstool, and that ""they"" want to kill her. Robert injects her with something, and she sleeps, but has a nightmare recollecting everything that has happened. Eventually she revives, and Robert says she is better. But she will be very weak for a few days. She protests that the soup was harmful, but Robert refuses to discuss it.
In the kitchen Judith is looking for the poisonous toadstool she left there, with Willow's help, but she can't find it. But she does find something belonging to Hester; it's not obvious (to the viewer) what it is, but Willow comments that it's a dangerous thing to leave lying about; you never know what it might get into.
Much later Ann wakens; a nurse has been employed to sit with her, and the crows are noisy outside. Ann asks the nurse if anything was discovered about the soup, but she says that none was left over so no test was possible; but Ann's immediate vomiting response prevented any permanent ill effect. Robert arrives, and the nurse leaves the room. Ann raises the matter of the soup again, and as always Robert curtly dismisses the question. Ann asks again what it was that killed his mother, but again he evades the matter. She repeats her discomfort at living at the house and begs him to consider leaving, but he simply turns his back on her and doesn't answer.
The next day Ann is packing a case, and she tells Willow she is going away; she asks Willow to secretly arrange a car to take her to the railway station; she isn't going to tell the household about her intention to leave. As Ann is packing, Willow pointedly mentions Ann's evening gown, and Ann says she can have it. Willow asks for a cocktail hat too. Willow mentions that ""funny things happen in this house"" and says that Ann is wise to leave. Willow makes the phone call for the car, and later tells Ann that the coast is clear for her to leave without being seen.
She is at the railway station and her train comes in; Ann seems to be having doubts about leaving now, and Diana (whom she met at the dance) gets off and talks to her. When Ann says she needs to catch the train, Cass says that is ""nonsense"", and insists that she comes back to her place for a rest. When they get there Diana tells Ann that she thinks that the aunts hoped Robert would marry Willow. It was possible that one of the aunts was Willow's mother. Ann finds Diana's sympathetic manner reassuring, and she agrees to let Diana drive her back to Crow Hollow.
Ann goes to her room to put back the clothes she had taken for her trip, and discovers Willow slumped over the dressing table. She is wearing Ann's evening dress, but with a large knife in her back, plainly dead. Ann screams and finds Robert. They don't phone the police or ambulance, but Hester and Opal appear, and Robert calmly tells them that Willow is dead.
Later the police come, and Ann is interrogated by a police detective; he asks if there was anything between Robert and Willow, and Ann insists that she herself was the intended victim. The policeman dismisses the idea out of hand because Willow's hair was fair and Ann's is dark; the policeman is sarcastic and hostile to Ann. The policeman has taken a necklace from Willow's body and asks Ann if it is strange that Robert gave her presents. Ann doesn't think so, and the conversation turns to Willow's parents. A local policeman volunteers that there used to be a rumour that her father was a gardener at Crow Hollow in the past; his name was Jed Dawson. But the man doesn't know who the mother was. ""That was kept very dark."" Ann believes that the police think that she herself was the killer, perhaps because of jealousy over Willow
The policeman has finished questioning Ann and there is a family conference in another room. Diana has come over to see if she can help, and Ann says that she is the police's principal suspect. As usual Robert uses his favourite response, ""Nonsense"", but the police won't even let Ann leave the house to stay at Diana's. Hester and Diana are interested in the revelation that Dawson was Willow's father, and Hester comments that that was where Willow got her good looks: he was a handsome devil. But Dawson was sacked and left to work for Diana's Mother.
Ann is convinced that she was the target of the murder, and that Willow was mistaken for he because she was sitting at her dressing table and wearing her evening dress, as she had said she could. Willow's fair hair, and Ann's dark hair, seem to disable the theory of mistaken identity until Ann realises that she also said Willow could have a cocktail hat: if she had that on, it would have concealed her hair. A brief reconstruction by Ann and Diana is arranged for the sceptical police.
Robert urges the theory on the police, and that Ann is in danger of a further attempt. Diana agrees to stay at the house in Willow's room in support of Ann.
In the night Hester knocks on Robert and Ann's bedroom door: there has been a phone call that a woman patient is ill and he is needed. Ann begs him not to go but as usual he disregards her feelings; she is to go to Willow's room and sit with Diana. Ann suddenly realises that she didn't hear the telephone ring even though she and Diana had slept lightly. Ann runs to tell Robert, and Opal is seeing him off with a cup of coffee; she says that she got the message about the unwell woman from Judith, but meantime she presses the coffee on Robert, Ann begs Robert not to drink it as it must be poisoned.
The mood suddenly changes instantly; Robert now seems to believe Ann, and confronts Opal: why should she want to kill him? In an equally sudden change, Opal says, ""Why shouldn't I? Why should either of you live now that Willow is dead? I always intended you [Robert] to marry Willow, so that she should be mistress of Crow Hollow, not her [Ann]! Yes, I tried to kill her too, so that you should be free again, free to marry Willow. But Instead I killed my own daughter,. My daughter WIllow"".
Robert says he will have to call the police and Opal goes to the kitchen, and drinks her poisoned coffee and is dead.
On another day Robert and Ann are happier; Robert is writing an application for a post at the Middlesex Hospital in London; he thinks Ann would be glad to get away. But Ann takes the application letter and tears it up: now at last she is content to live at Crow Hollow."

tt0044658,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'War']","The year is 1940, the second year of World War 2; the United Kingdom stands almost alone in facing the threat from Germany. The United States remains neutral, but has agreed to loan fifty mothballed destroyers from the First World War to the UK, an arrangement known as lend-lease.
In Halifax, Nova Scotia (Canada) a British ship's company have arrived to take over one of the destroyers; they are marched to the quayside, and ratings and officers express negative comments about the ship's age. The British captain, Lt Cdr Fraser, addresses the ship's company, explaining the situation. The US crew will remain on board for a period until the British crew are familiar with the ship.
As the British crew board the ship, Captain Fraser quietly reprimands the First Lieutenant, Lt Jennings, for the slovenly appearance of the crew. A moment later the US Captain tells Fraser he envies him, for having a whole crew with combat experience. Fraser replies that on the contrary, only four officers and fourteen ratings have been to sea before. Fraser says that he too left the Royal Navy in 1932.
While they are talking, OS Flanagan (""Yank"") reports to the Captain as he has been ordered; he is to be the Captain's servant, although at first Fraser thinks he is joking.
The handover period is complete and the ship is renamed HMS Ballantrae. At sea on the bridge, the Captain asks the navigating officer Lt Grant the location of the ship. Grant starts to take a fix to find out but is reprimanded by Fraser, as he should already know. Grant is a RNVR officer; regular officers often looked down on these officers as weekend sailors.
They make contact with a convoy that they are to escort, but a main steam pipe joint bursts and the ship is disabled. With an unsettled sea she rolls considerably, and leakage water in the bilges has to be bailed manually. Eventually the fault is repaired, and the Captain immediately exercises action stations, to the annoyance of some of the hands. Eventually the put into Londonderry and some of the men get shore leave. But AS Wood has a letter from his wife about a lodger she has taken in; he is not sure he likes the sound of it.
The Captain inspects the ship prior to the libertymen going ashore, but he finds numerous signs of slovenly work, and he cancels the shore leave. All hands will attend to the state of the ship. When the work is finished, the libertymen go ashore, but the Captain again reprimands the First Officer for the slovenly appearance of the men.
Fraser has to call on the flotilla commander, Captain (D) Wilson. Wilson welcomes Fraser to the group, but the informal conversation is extremely strained, and it emerges that Fraser left the RN after a Court Martial.
The officers are in a bar when a WRNS officer comes in and orders a drink. The officers undisguisedly compete for her attention and bet on whether one of them can get her attention. The First Lieutenant chats her up, and his offer of an expensive meal persuades her to go to a restaurant with him.
Meanwhile several of the ratings are in another bar, where the credulous publican wants to hear what they have been doing. He gives them all free drinks, but after a while two ratings from the senior ship make loud and rude remarks about the Ballantrae and her Captain, and a fight starts.
Back on board the next day, AS Daniels is at the Captain's table as a requestman for extra pay, for the bailing in the bilges during the breakdown. He quotes the paragraph number of the Admiralty Instructions and is granted the pay; he was a trade union organiser in civvy street.
Later on the Ballantrae is looking for convoy stragglers; their position is uncertain in fog and Fraser decides to go in the direction from which they have come to find them, believing that they will be late at the rendezvous. After some time there is an explosion five miles astern; the stragglers were in fact on time and he has missed them. Fraser reverses his course and catches up with a merchant ship, but its master says that the other ship was torpedoed with the loss of most of the crew.
Fraser has a painful interview with Captain (D) who agrees that the loss was not directly Fraser's fault, but nevertheless it was regrettable.
OS Flanagan calls in at a caf√© ashore to see his girlfriend Marge; Glad is on duty and after hesitation tells him that Marge has gone off with another man. Flanagan is downcast but then asks Glad to go out with him, which she agrees to.
Fraser is at home talking to his son; the boy wants to join the Royal Navy and Fraser has mixed feelings about that; the boy has heard about ""Dave Wilson"" and Fraser explains that there was a collision many years ago in which Wilson and Fraser were involved; Fraser got court- martialled, although the fault was not entirely his; now Wilson is the Captain (D) to whom Fraser reports.
They are back on patrol with a convoy, when a U boat surfaces nearby. Fraser is about to depth charge when a main steam pipe blows, and the ship is crippled. The U-boat submerges and is lost. Later there is a dive-bomber attack on the convoy by the enemy. Anti-aircraft fire brings one of the enemy aircraft down, but Captain Davis claims it as a hit by his ship, to the disbelief of the Balantrae's crew. Nevertheless Fraser congratulates the crew. They are entering harbour later, feeling that at last they have had some success, when the propeller fouls the boom, bringing further humiliation on the ship.
The First Officer Jennings is frustrated and is thinking of asking for a transfer away from the ship; he goes to the cypher office ashore and meets June Mallory, the WRNS officer he took out in Londonderry.
In a pub, AS Wood is asked by the landlord to speak to AS Daniels, who is moping over a letter he has received. As an older man, Wood adopts an avuncular tone, and Daniels eventually admits that his Mother is dangerously ill, but his trade union scruples prevent him from asking for the concession of compassionate leave to visit her. Meanwhile Flanagan is back in the caf√© and proposes to Glad and they get married.
The ship is in the dockyard and Daniels is coming back on board; someone, obviously Wood, told an officer and Daniels got his compassionate leave and visited his Mother, who has had an operation and is fine.
Captain Wilson talks to Fraser and asks him if he would like command of a new build ship ""to make a fresh start"" but Fraser refuses the offer; later he meets his son who has joined the Royal Navy as an ordinary seaman.
Back at sea the Ballantrae is hunting an enemy minelaying submarine off the Lizard (Cornwall). They are close inshore. There is a strange echo on the ASDIC and the ship collides with a submerged wreck. The Navigating Officer Grant checks his warning signals and discovers that the wreck was reported; he had failed to enter it on his charts.
At the subsequent court of inquiry, Fraser says that he accepts full responsibility for the failure to mark the wreck's position, even though Grant admits that he should have done it himself. There is discussion among the court members. A court member is very critical of Fraser, but Wilson defends Fraser. Later the court will decide not to court-martial Fraser.
The seamen are celebrating with Flanagan and Glad, who is pregnant. Flanagan is sending Glad to stay in Exeter where it will be safer than staying in Plymouth, which is a target for enemy bombing. Grant, the Navigating Officer hears that Fraser has been cleared of blame, but now thinks that he himself will get sent away for his failure. The Captain returns to the ship and tells him he can stay.
However in a pub there is a fight between the crew of another ship in the flotilla and the crew of Ballantrae. The damage to the pub is considerable and the publican is suing the crew for damage afterwards.
Back at Ballantrae the Captain is going ashore; in fact he is ashore all day and returns clearly drunk. It emerges he has been with the publican and persuaded him not to press the charges for the fight. At the defaulters' parade the next day Fraser is lenient with the men, as the publican has evidently explained that the men were defending the name of the ship, and of Fraser himself.
Back at sea they are wit ha convoy and a U-boat surfaces nearby. Fraser makes for it and rams it, sinking it. Back ashore, Wilson offers Fraser a promotion but he refuses it; Wilson then offers Fraser a dangerous individual mission for Ballantrae, which Fraser accepts; at this stage the two men don't know what the mission is.
Meanwhile some of the crew are in a pub, and an Exeter haulage driver says that there has been heavy and devastating bombing there the previous night; Flanagan thinks of his wife and child, and makes off.
It's Christmas and in the wardroom the First Officer has a hangover and has ruffled the feathers of the WRNS officer June, but evidently things are really all right between them. But the Captain receives a telegram stating that his son has been killed in action. He struggles to complete the traditional Christmas Captain's rounds.
Flanagan returns to the ship and is charged with going absent without leave; but he reveals that his wife Glad and their child were both killed in the bombing in Exeter.
The Captain briefs the men that they are about to go on a hazardous mission, and the First Officer Lt Jennings is told that he has a command; his relief is already at Devonport; but Jennings makes it clear he intends to stay with the ship. He goes to see his WRNS fianc√©e, but she knows from signals she handles that he is going on a dangerous mission.
The next morning a large number of commandos embark and Ballantrae sets off, with eighteen MLs in company for the commandos. The Captain briefs everyone that their mission is to damage the lock gates at St Nazaire, the only dockyard on the Atlantic that can receive enemy battleships. They have a demolition charge in the bow. The commandos will damage shore facilities, and everyone will be taken off in the MLs.
As they approach St Nazaire, they are spotted by the defence forces; they hoist a German battle ensign and make a signal in German to mislead the enemy. They then strike the German flag and hoist the white ensign, and start firing. The defensive fire is heavy and Ballanatrae sustains numerous casualties.
After mistaking the intended ramming point they successfully ram the lock gate and evacuate the ship after setting the demolition fuses. The wounded and most of the crew are got off in MLs but the officers are stranded in a building ashore. The demolition charges have not detonated on time.
A German officer interrogates the Captain as to the purpose of their mission, but he keeps silent. Some German officers go aboard to investigate and as the remaining British are marched away as prisoners, the demolition charges finally explode. Their mission has been accomplished."
tt0044685,"['Biography', 'Family', 'Musical', 'Romance']","A completely fabricated film biography of the great Danish storyteller (the Danes were gratified that this movie paid tribute to their national hero, but were very annoyed that the scholarly poet was depicted as a vagabond shoemaker), which serves as a vehicle for Frank Loesser songs that recount the famous tales of Thumbelina, the Ugly Duckling, the King's New Clothes, and the Little Mermaid.In the story, Hans Christian Andersen, a shoemaker, is booted out of his own village by the Town Council at the request of the local schoolmaster, who would rather the children of the village attend school than listen to Hans's fairy tales. Not wishing Hans to undergo any humiliation, his apprentice Peter convinces him to go to Copenhagen, before Hans can find out what the Town Council has decided. Peter goes with him.Once there, Hans is promptly arrested for advertising his profession in front of the King's statue. He is released through the efforts of Peter and immediately hired by a ballet company, where the prima ballerina, Doro, insists that she needs new dancing slippers in order to be able to dance properly. Hans immediately falls head over heels for Doro, not knowing she is already married to Nils, the demanding and unpleasant ballet director. When he finishes the shoes and goes to deliver them, he accidentally witnesses a quarrel between Nils and Doro, which culminates in the two of them slapping each other.Hans immediately decides to himself that Doro is miserable and unhappy (she is not), and writes the story ""The Little Mermaid"" for her. As Peter reads it for the first time, the sheets of paper are blown by the wind and end up at the ballet studio, where Doro reads it and immediately concludes that Hans has written the story so that she and Nils can turn it into a ballet. Hans is delighted when he hears the news.One day, while Hans is telling stories to the children, he notices a completely bald boy, Lars, being teased. Lars has lost his hair because of a fever. Hans tells the boy the story of ""The Ugly Duckling"", which gives Lars new confidence. In gratitude, Lars's father, a newspaper publisher, prints the story in the local paper and gives Hans the first copy. It becomes Hans's first printed tale.The ballet company has been on tour, but when they return, Doro invites Hans to the premiere of the ballet ""The Little Mermaid'. Hans, believing that she is in love with him, is overjoyed, but Peter, who knows the truth (that Doro and Nils enjoy quarreling as a natural part of their married life), tries to reason with Hans, but the shoemaker will not listen and fires Peter. When Hans shows up at the ballet, he insists on giving Doro some new slippers that he made, but Nils, eager to see that everything goes well, angrily locks Hans in the prop room, where he hears, but does not see the ballet. Nils forgets about him and leaves him there all night.The next morning, Doro is furious when she hears that Hans has been locked up all night, but she is still quite affectionate with her husband. She sends her chambermaid to bring Hans to their apartment. When Hans arrives, Nils leaves them alone to talk. She apologizes to Hans and gently asks him why he wrote the story for her. When he tells her that it was his way of acknowledging that he knew that ""she was miserable with her husband"", Doro is moved, but not angry. Suddenly Nils returns and from his laughing, jovial demeanor, Hans now realizes that Peter was right and that Nils and Doro are very happily married. She tenderly tells him that she will remember what he told her every time she dances the ballet. As soon as he is gone, Doro embraces Nils, quietly weeping.Hans leaves Copenhagen and on the way back to his village, runs into Peter. The two reconcile and Hans says ""I'm through telling stories, especially with myself'. Peter assures him he will go on telling stories over and over again. We see a montage showing the titles of Hans's most famous stories, which are all eventually published.In the final scene, we see the now celebrated Hans, surrounded by the children and all the adults (including the schoolmaster) , having even more success than before telling stories."
tt0044706,"['Drama', 'Thriller', 'Western']","The movie opens with outlaws Jack Colby (Lee Van Cleef), Ben Miller (Sheb Wooley), and Jim Pierce (Robert Wilke) meeting up on horseback and riding into the small town of Hadleyville on a Sunday morning. As church bells ring out, the townspeople eye the notorious gang warily. Meanwhile, Marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) and pacifist Quaker Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) are getting married at the Justice of the Peace office. The three outlaws ride through town and settle in outside the train depot to await the noon arrival of gang leader Frank Miller.Marshal Kane and his radiant bride are congratulated by the town mayor (Thomas Mitchell) and the retired Marshal (Lon Chaney, Jr.), and Kane reluctantly hangs up his star per his wife's wishes. Just then a telegram arrives announcing the pardon of Frank Miller, who Kane had arrested and sent to prison for murder years earlier. The station master declares that Miller is coming on the noon train. Along with the arrival of the other three outlaws, it is obvious that the Miller gang is reuniting to come after Kane and the judge who sentenced Miller. Kane and Amy are quickly hustled out of town in hopes of avoiding bloodshed. Once out on the open road, Kane suddenly turns his buckboard around and tells a bewildered Amy that he can't run from his past. Besides, the new Marshal won't arrive until the following day and the town will be defenseless. Back in town, the world-weary judge who sentenced Miller to prison is packing up his office and getting out of town. He advises Kane to do the same.Kane's hot-headed young deputy, Harvey Pell (Lloyd Bridges), who was passed over for the Marshal's job, presses Kane to turn over the reins to him and get out of town. Kane declines. Complicating things is the fact that Deputy Pell has taken up with saloon owner Helen Ramirez (Katy Jurado), a former lover of both Kane and Frank Miller. With Miller coming back, Helen Ramirez decides to sell the saloon and leave town. Determined not to be a widow, Amy Fowler also buys a ticket on the departing noon train.At the train depot, Ben Miller grows impatient and rides in to pay a visit to the town saloon, where he is welcomed like a returning hero. As Miller leaves, he runs straight into Kane and they exchange glares. Kane enters the unfriendly confines of the saloon to ask for volunteers and overhears the surly bartender speculating he will soon be shot dead. An angry Kane knocks him to the floor. The jeering saloon patrons rebuff Kane and he leaves empty handed. Kane then pays a visit to the packed church and interrupts the sermon to ask for help. A heated debate erupts among the parishioners, and a lesson in civics follows as a few brave citizens stand up for Kane and the rest find excuses to avoid conflict. The realization that he may be fighting alone begins to dawn on Kane. A visit to the retired and cynical former Marshal only produces another rejection.Meanwhile, Amy drops in on a surprised Helen Ramirez, searching for an answer to Kane's stubborn refusal to leave. Amy thinks her husband is staying because of Ramirez. Ramirez sets her straight. Tired and stressed, Kane goes to the livery stable and thinks about saddling his horse and leaving. Deputy Pell sees him and follows him in, pressuring him to leave. When Kane resists, Harvey slugs him. A desperate fistfight ensues, which Kane wins. Kane goes to the barber's office to clean up and hears the undertaker building a coffin.Back at the Marshal's office, the one man who has volunteered to stand with Kane backs out when he discovers they will be alone. After the man leaves, Kane makes out his will and leaves it in a desk drawer. The clock ticks down the last seconds before noon. Suddenly, the shrill whistle of the approaching train sounds. The three outlaws lace up their gunbelts as the train nears. In a heartwrenching scene, Kane steps out onto the street just as Amy and Helen Ramirez drive by on their way to the station. Amy looks away, but Helen doesn't. Just as the two women arrive at the station, Frank Miller steps off the train, makes eye contact with Helen, and turns away to strap on a gun belt. In an iconic scene, the camera goes wide to reveal Marshal Kane all alone on the deserted streets.The Miller gang walks into town, where Kane is waiting. Kane catches a break when foolish Ben Miller smashes a shop window to steal a hat. Kane circles behind the gang on their blind side and calls out. When they whirl around, Kane drops Ben Miller. Amy hears the gunshot as the train pulls out and jumps off. She runs into town to find Ben Miller dead in the street. Kane is soon caught in a crossfire and takes refuge in the hayloft of the livery stable. Colby rushes the stable, only to be gunned down by Kane. The remaining two outlaws set fire to the stables and prepare to shoot Kane as he is smoked out.

One by one the guests receive their invitations. Rev. Gregory's sister-in-law Lydia lives in a London hotel. She was widowed at a young age and has no children. His own sister, Bridget, is invited but must find someone to look after her cat while she is away. Richard, a distant cousin, is coming and hopefully will be driving Rev. Gregory's younger daughter Margaret. She has not been home in several years and has a very important job at a fashion house. Michael Gregory, Jenny and Margaret's brother, is in the army and not really expected home. But he wangles a two-day leave after claiming that his mother has recently died. In fact, she died six months earlier. Jenny's boyfriend, David Paterson, is leaving after New Year's to work in Brazil. He wants to marry Jenny so she can come with him, but the difficulty is her father. Who would look after him? David suggests that Margaret should now take over her father's care, since she has been living it up in London all these years. But Jenny insists that her sister would refuse. David is frustrated since he won't be home for five years. Rather meanly he points out how old Jenny will be in five years. Lydia and Bridget meet at the train station. Bridget is traveling third class and refuses to allow Lydia to upgrade her ticket so they can sit together. So Lydia has her luggage moved to Bridget's carriage and they settle in for a long gossip.Richard tries to reach Margaret but she is nowhere to be found. So he drives down alone. Obviously there has been a tragedy in her life which has caused her to avoid her family. The guests arrive, including Michael who hitchhiked to get there. Richard makes up a story about Margaret having the flu, to explain her absence. Right away Jenny's aunts guess that she and David are in love. Jenny explains the situation and orders them not to tell her father. If he knew, he would insist on her leaving. Margaret arrives while the family are at dinner. She has obviously been drinking. Rev. Gregory suggests that she go to bed but she snaps at him. While helping Jenny in the kitchen, Margaret explains the reason for her extended absence. During the war she had an affair with an American serviceman. He was killed and she learned she was pregnant. She went to stay with friends during her pregnancy and gave birth to a son, Simon. But the child died of meningitis at the age of five. Since then she has been drinking heavily. Jenny tells her about David and asks if she will move back home to look after their father. As expected, Margaret refuses. Michael and Margaret go to the movies, which distresses their father. In reality they go to a pub. She is quite drunk when they return and passes out in the living room. Michael is reprimanded for ""letting"" her drink so much. He tried to stop her but couldn't. She told him about Simon but still doesn't want her father to know. Lydia and Bridget tell Rev. Gregory about Jenny and David. He is delighted, having hoped they would fall in love. He insists that he will be fine alone and Jenny should marry. The next morning, Margaret asks Richard to drive her to the train station. But the car is frozen and he has trouble starting it. Meanwhile, Michael and his father have an argument. Michael says they, his children, couldn't tell him the truth about things. Eventually he reveals Margaret's secret and accuses her of being a drunk. Rev. Gregory leaves for the early Christmas Day service at the church. When he returns, he tells Margaret that he knows about Simon. But Michael didn't mention that the boy was dead, leaving Margaret to explain. Richard finally gets the car started but Margaret has changed her mind about leaving. Jenny scurries around the kitchen, making preparations for Christmas dinner. David appears and encounters Margaret in the front hall. To his surprise, she agrees to come home and keep house for her father. Jenny is delighted with the news. The family goes to the mid-morning Christmas service."
tt0044741,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'Not', 'Rated']","Ikiru, meaning ""to live"", is the story of a top Japanese bureaucrat coming to terms with his impending death, and of his work to create a positive, lasting effect on a community. The story opens with an image of an X-ray. A voiceover informs the audience that unbeknownst to him, Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) has terminal stomach cancer. Kanji, Section Chief of Public Affairs, is hard at work stamping papers and overseeing his employees when the Kuroe Women's Association approaches the division for help. Their goal is to have a cesspool in their community replaced by a park where their children can safely play. Sakai (Haruo Tanaka) receives their request and asks Kanji for advice. Without a second's hesitation, Kanji instructs him to send them to Public Works.
Later that day, a burst of girlish laughter rings out in the silent room when the only female staffer, Toyo Odagiri (Miki Odagiri), reads a joke about how the bureaucracy is merely wasting their time in busywork. Sub-Section Chief Ono (Kamatari Fujiwara), full of self-righteousness, asks Toyo how she dares to laugh in the middle of a workday. Toyo explains that she has just read a funny joke. They make her read it to them; however, they do not find it amusing. The voiceover continues that Kanji has already ""been dead for twenty years."" Kanji reaches in his drawer for paper to use to clean his stamp, removing the top sheet. The audience sees that it is a title page of a report that he did recommending how to improve efficiency twenty years before.
Public Works sends the Kuroe Women's Association on to another division, beginning endless rounds of the bureaucracy. They finally arrive at the office of the Deputy Mayor (Nobuo Nakamura) where he, after using political speak to promise them nothing, sends them back to where they first began. The Kuroe Women's Association returns to Public Affairs; however, Kanji has taken the day off to visit a physician. Sakai, not remembering them, again directs them to Public Works. In frustration after facing rejection yet again, the women loudly complain as they turn to leave. Chastened, an apologetic Sakai follows them, recommending that they file a written request.
Kanji is in the waiting room at the medical center when the name of a patient rings out over the loudspeaker. A man moves closer to confide in Kanji that the man who just left is dying of stomach cancer. He tells Kanji the symptoms, which terrify Kanji because they resemble his own. The man explains that the physicians here do not tell their patients the truth, and he tells Kanji what they will say instead if you are dying of cancer. Visibly shaken, Kanji listens as the man states that if they say it is only an ulcer, no need for surgery, and eat whatever you like, you have less than a year to live. He continues, once you start vomiting, you have only three months left. When Kanji finally gets to see the doctor, the physician gives him the diagnosis of an ulcer, explains that there is no need for surgery, and tells Kanji to eat whatever he would like. Kanji drops his coat in horror, remembering the man's words. As the nurse picks up his coat, Kanji begs the doctor to be honest with him and to admit that he has cancer. The doctor instead denies Kanji an honest diagnosis. Dejectedly, Kanji lowers his head to the table.
Kanji is a widower with a son he has raised alone since boyhood. Kanji adores his beloved son Mitsuo (Nobuo Kaneko) and rushes home to both tell Mitsuo and to derive comfort from him. Mitsuo is not home, so a shaken Kanji huddles on the floor in the dark, waiting for the son he adores. Unaware that he is waiting there in the dark, Mitsuo and his wife Kazue (Kyoko Seki) walk into the room carrying on a conversation about how they cannot wait to inherit Kanji's money. In despair, Kanji listens as they discuss how they want access to his money now so that they can finally buy a home of their own. When Mitsuo turns on the light, they see a heartbroken Kanji. In tears, Kanji runs downstairs to his own room, his faith in Mitsuo shaken.
Perplexed, the Public Affairs employees send a staffer to Kanji's home because, after 30 years of perfect attendance, Kanji has not shown up for work or even called in sick for five days. Shocked, Kazue calls her husband to tell an equally perplexed Mitsuo that even though Kanji has been leaving faithfully every single day, he has not gone to work. Kanji is passing his days in a bar, drinking to forget his troubles. A writer at the bar befriends Kanji, and after learning that Kanji is dying, invites him for an evening of ""enjoying life."" They go to a red-light district where a drunken Kanji despairingly sings the theme song about how quickly life passes.
Determined to resign from the bureaucracy, Toyo hunts for Kanji, finally running into him by happenstance on the street. After she explains that working in the bureaucracy is killing her soul, he agrees to stamp her resignation letter. She goes home with him so that he can get his stamp. His housekeeper (Yoshie Minami) witnesses Toyo grabbing his hands in excitement. As Toyo prepares to leave his home, Kanji asks if he might go with her; she agrees. From their window, a surprised Mitsuo and Kazue witness Kanji and Toyo leaving together. Kanji convinces Toyo to spend the day with him, and they forge a friendship.
Kanji decides to try again to tell Mitsuo about his terminal cancer. Mitsuo, however, misunderstands about Kanji's relationship with Toyo. Before Kanji can confide in him, a furious Mitsuo demands Kanji protect his inheritance from Toyo. This incident, combined with the conversation he previously overheard, leads Kanji to believe that his son cares more about his money than about him.
Toyo's hectic new position in industry leaves her stressed; however, Kanji does not see this. He continues to spend time with her searching for insight into how she manages to be so full of life. Toyo explains that she finds fulfillment by making toy rabbits for the children of Japan. Kanji has a revelation, and he leaves hopeful; however, Toyo despairingly realizes that she is the one not truly living. Kanji, remembering the cesspool, decides to create a lasting effect in Kuroe.
Five months after his visit to the medical center, Kanji dies. At his funeral, the Kuroe Women's Association pays its respects, sobbing in grief. A police officer shares that he saw Kanji swinging in the park the night he died, joyfully singing. In flashbacks, we see Kanji visiting to assess Kuroe; working tenaciously to overcome every barrier; and chuckling when the Yakuza threaten his life, the life of a dying man, due to his interference in their plan to turn Kuroe into a red-light district. As the bureaucratic staffers reminisce, they finally credit Kanji with building the park. This leads the staffers to drunkenly vow to follow Kanji's example.
A group of citizens approach Public Affairs for help, however, when Sakai asks newly appointed Section Chief Ono for advice, he directs them to another division. Kimura jumps to his feet reproachfully, wanting to remind Ono of the vow made at Kanji's funeral. Ono stares aggressively at Kimura until he rights his chair and sinks down at his desk, buried under a mound of paperwork. Weighed down with despair, Kimura stops on the bridge over Kuroe as he makes his way home. He pays his respects to Kanji as he watches the children of Kuroe happily playing in their new park. He remembers how Kanji overcame barriers to build this safe place for the children of Kuroe to grow and thrive. As he walks on, the viewer has the honor of determining whether he will give in to pressure, or if he will instead strive to overcome barriers, following Kanji's example, and help an oppressed group."

Unpopular Norman Prince John has ruled England since his brother, King Richard, left for the Holy Land to lead the Third Crusade, and many assume that Richard is now dead. During Saxon Ivanhoe's long journey back to England, however, he finds Richard in an Austrian prison, languishing because John will not pay his ransom. Once back in England, Ivanhoe disguises himself as a minstrel and goes to the castle of his father Cedric, with whom he became estranged when he left for the Holy Land. While Cedric offers hospitality in his banquet hall to both Norman and Saxon travelers, Ivanhoe is recognized only by his faithful servant, Wamba.Wamba takes him to see Rowena, Cedric's ward, whom Ivanhoe has loved since childhood. Ivanhoe returns to the banquet hall just as another traveler, a Jew named Isaac, seeks refuge for the night. Although the Normans present, including De Bois-Guilbert and Sir Hugh De Bracy, protest, Cedric offers hospitality to Isaac, insisting that everyone is welcome at his table. As they dine, the Normans discuss a tournament that will soon take place in Ashby, prompting Guilbert to recall a past tournament during which a masked Saxon knight named Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe bested him, then disappeared. Cedric then bitterly says that Ivanhoe was his son, but is now dead to him. Ivanhoe later reveals himself to Cedric and asks for money to save Richard, but Cedric is convinced the king is dead and refuses. Ivanhoe tells Rowena that he will see her after winning the tournament, then leaves with Wamba.Later that night, Norman soldiers attempt to rob Isaac, who has been forced to sleep in the barn, but Ivanhoe and Wamba interrupt the attack. A grateful Isaac then takes Ivanhoe and Wamba to his home in Sheffield, where Ivanhoe asks Isaac to help raise money for Richard's ransom. Isaac does not find Richard any more sympathetic to Jews than John, but because Isaac is in Ivanhoe's debt, he promises to supplement whatever money is raised.The next night, a young woman who says that she is the servant of Isaac's daughter Rebecca, approaches Ivanhoe at the inn at which he is staying and offers jewels to finance his kit in the tournament. Looking closely at her eyes, Ivanhoe recognizes her as the beautiful woman he noticed at the window of Isaac's house and deduces that she is Rebecca.On the day of the jousting tournament, Prince John presides as well-outfitted Normans defeat ragged Saxon challengers. Then Ivanhoe rides onto the field, suited in black armor and identifying himself only as a Saxon. The Saxons cheer as he challenges, then bests, five Norman knights in a row. Despite a wound in the shoulder, Ivanhoe stays on his horse and is declared the winner. As the victor, Ivanhoe selects Rowena as the tournament's Queen of Love and Beauty, then must fight Guilbert, who now recognizes him. After a fierce battle, Ivanhoe is knocked from his horse and carried off the field. Rebecca, who tells Rowena that she has learned the medical arts from a woman burned as a witch, attends to Ivanhoe's serious wounds. Although Rowena senses that Rebecca loves Ivanhoe, she knows that he will be well cared for by her and allows him to be taken to Isaac's house. Their departure is observed by a Norman who tells Guilbert.That night, Guilbert tells John about Ivanhoe's attempts to raise Richard's ransom money and the involvement of Isaac, who is a wealthy banker. Meanwhile, in Sheffield, Rebecca confesses her love to the unconscious Ivanhoe, but is gently warned by her father that her love is impossible because she is a Jew.When Ivanhoe awakens, Isaac tells him that money for the ransom is growing, just as Wamba and Locksley, a Saxon nobleman who lives in the forest, arrive to warn him that ""Prince John's jackals"" are after him. Wamba adds that Cedric and Rebecca have come to Sheffield to be near him, prompting Ivanhoe to ask Wamba to take Rebecca to Cedric while he hides in the forest with Locksley. By the time Guilbert and De Bracey arrive at Sheffield, Ivanhoe is gone, further angering Guilbert. He and his men soon find the caravan on which Rebecca and Rowena are traveling, and take the women, Cedric and Wamba prisoner. Hearing of their capture, Ivanhoe approaches Guilbert's castle and asks that he be allowed to take their place. Guilbert agrees, then Ivanhoe enters the courtyard and asks to speak to Cedric, with whom he reconciles. Instead of allowing Cedric and the others to leave, however, Guilbert breaks his word and puts both men in chains. Upstairs, the ambitious De Bracy proposes to Rowena, who is the last of the royal Saxons, but she slaps him.Later Guilbert, who desires Rebecca, tells her that he must possess her. She runs to the balcony and threatens to jump, but when he offers to free Ivanhoe if she returns his passion, she agrees. Just then Locksley and his archers surround the castle. Guilbert has Ivanhoe brought up from the dungeon and threatens to hang him, but Ivanhoe is able to escape when the archers fire arrows at his guards. As a battle ensues, Ivanhoe frees the men in the dungeon, but in doing so a fire erupts that envelopes Wamba. As more of Locksley's men storm the castle, Ivanhoe rescues Rowena from De Bracy, but Guilbert escapes by using Rebecca as a shield. When Guilbert brings Rebecca to Prince John's court, John and his advisers come up with a plan to use their captive.A few days later, Isaac tells Ivanhoe that the king's ransom money has been raised, but Ivanhoe reveals that John has demanded the same amount to free Rebecca or she will be burned as a witch. Isaac tells Ivanhoe that it is his responsibility to free Rebecca and insists that the money raised be sent to ransom Richard. Seeing Ivanhoe's concern, Rowena reveals her fears that he is in love with Rebecca, but he denies it. At Rebecca's trial, paid and coerced witnesses testify that she is a witch, and only Guilbert defends her. After Rebecca denies that she is a witch, Guilbert asks to speak with her privately and begs her to renounce her faith to save her life. After her refusal, the court sentences her to burn at the stake. Just then, Ivanhoe, who has secretly watched the trial, throws down his glove and challenges the court to determine her guilt by a battle with her champion. John accepts the challenge and chooses Guilbert as his champion for a fight to the death at Ashby.Moments before the tournament, Guilbert offers to default to Ivanhoe if Rebecca will only accept his love, but Rebecca answers that they are in God's hands. While Guilbert and Ivanhoe battle hand-to-hand with ball and chain, Richard and his men ride onto the field, forcing John to bow in submission. Ivanhoe finally defeats Guilbert, who dies after telling Rebecca he loves her and that fate made her love Ivanhoe instead of him. After Guilbert dies, Rowena questions Rebecca about Ivanhoe, but she insists that his heart belongs to Rowena."

He calls his wife and tells her he can't forgive her and is going away to think. He ignores her pleas to come home and won't say where he is or where he is headed.Because of delays and an unscheduled stop due to weather, David, despite himself, befriends three other travelers: Binky Gay, a failed actress (Shelley Winters); Robert Fortness, an alcoholic doctor (Michael Rennie); and Eddie Hoke, a clownish traveling salesman (Keenan Wynn).

Tension builds in Innisfree, a highly sporting community, as the townspeople hope for a fight between Thornton and Danaher. However, Thornton refuses to fight. He suffers the guilt of a terrible secret concerning his last prize fight, which only the Reverend Playfair knows.As tensions grow, Father Lonergan counsels Mary Kate about her duties as a married woman, as Reverend Playfair councils Sean about what the dowry means to his wife. Although Mary Kate acquiesces, she feels that the dowerless marriage is improper and leaves Sean. To Sean, this is the last straw. He goes to the train station, literally drags his wife back to Squire Danaher's farm, collecting a very large crowd along the way, as the neighboring towns realize that Sean is about to confront Will Danaher and demands Mary Kate's dowry. Danaher refuses to pay the dowry, so Sean calls off the marriage - claiming that the dowry is their custom, not his. Shamed in front of the whole county, Danaher gives up the dowry (350 pounds cash). To further prove a point Sean stalks over to the nearby threshing furnace, where Mary Kate open the door for Sean to throw the money into the fire. This infuriates Danaher and he takes a swing at Sean, who defends himself. Mary Kate sees that her husband is willing to fight and heads home to cook dinner.For the rest of nearby residents of Innesfree, farmhands, the train engineers and passengers who've stayed for the event, the long awaited fight breaks out - starting at Danaher's farm and heading into Innesfree. During this Sean learns Danaher is, indeed, a worthy opponent. Many a side bets are laid - including Reverend Playfair, the visiting Bishop, and the local constabulary. By the end, the two men respect each other and have become fast (if drunken) friends. After the fight, the town gathers together to also help save Reverend Playfair's job and Will Danaher starts formally courting the Widow Tellane."

Don barely tolerates his vapid, shallow leading lady, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), who has convinced herself that the fake romance their studio concocted and publicized is real.One day, to escape from overenthusiastic fans, Don jumps into a passing car driven by Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). She drops him off, but not before claiming to be a stage actress and sneering at his undignified accomplishments as a cinema actor. Later, at a party, the head of Don's studio, R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell), shows a short demonstration of a talking picture, but his guests are unimpressed. Don runs into Kathy again at the party. To his amusement and her embarrassment, he discovers that Kathy is only a chorus girl, part of the entertainment. Furious, she throws a pie at him, only to hit Lina right in the face. Later, Don makes up with Kathy and they begin falling in love.After the first talking picture, The Jazz Singer, proves to be a smash hit, R.F. decides he has no choice but to convert the new Lockwood and Lamont film, The Dueling Cavalier, into a talkie. The production is beset with difficulties (most, if not all, taken from real life), by far the worst being Lina's comically grating voice. A test screening is a disaster. In one scene, for instance, Don repeats ""I love you"" to Lina over and over, to the audience's derisive laughter (a reference to a scene by John Gilbert in his first talkie[2]).Don's best friend, Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor), comes up with the idea to overdub Lina's voice with Kathy's and they persuade R.F. to turn The Dueling Cavalier into a musical called The Dancing Cavalier. When Lina finds out that Kathy is dubbing her voice, she is furious and does everything possible to sabotage the romance between Don and Kathy. She is even more irate when she discovers that Kathy will receive screen credit and a big publicity campaign, so she blackmails R.F. into withholding credit, and, later, demands that Kathy (a contract player) continue to do so in the future.The premiere of The Dueling Cavalier is a tremendous success. When the audience clamors for Lina to sing live, Don, Cosmo and R.F. improvise and get Lina to lip-synch while Kathy sings into a second microphone while hidden behind the curtain. Unbeknownst to Lina, as she starts ""singing"", Don, Cosmo and R.F. gleefully open the curtain behind her, revealing the deception Lina flees in embarrassment. When Kathy tries to run away as well, Don has her stopped and introduces the audience to ""the real star of the film"".Dan and Kathy start singing a love song. Final cue of they both kissing in front of a huge billboard advertising the film ""Singin' in the Rain"" with Don Lockwood and Kathy Selden."

Surrounded by a carping landlady and shrewish female co-workers, he fantasizes about murdering women, while brandishing an empty rifle. Eddie seeks help from his former physician at the local state prison and becomes distraught when he discovers the doctor is on vacation.In a frantic effort to get help, Eddie purposely burns his hand by placing it on a hotplate. At the hospital the intern, suspicious that the wound was self-inflicted, asks Eddie if he was ever in a mental hospital, and Eddie admits that he was while in prison serving time for assaulting a woman. When the intern consults with a doctor about sending Eddie to the psychiatric ward, the doctor points out that Eddie would be held for only three days and then released.Late for work, Eddie hurries to make a delivery to nightclub singer Jean Darr, who is trying on a low-cut evening gown when he arrives. Jean notices a stain on her gown and asks Eddie if he might do a rush order on it. Eddie agrees and Jean chats pleasantly with him, until a male friend interrupts them. Jean curtly pushes Eddie out the back entrance with the gown. That night, Eddie waits outside of Jean's apartment, carrying his rifle in a small case, and follows her as she walks several blocks to the club at which she performs. Eddie sneaks onto the apartment building rooftop across the street and waits until Jean comes out, then shoots her. Police detectives Lt. Frank Kafka and Sgt. Joe Ferris arrive on the scene and take charge of the investigation.The next day, Eddie flirts with a woman in a bar but although she gives him her address and phone number, Eddie grows angry when she traps him in the lies he has told about his job. Later that day, Eddie takes Jean's gown to his room and hides it, but when he suffers a series of humiliating encounters in the park, he returns to his room, tears the dress and burns it in the incinerator. After staring at the address of the woman from the bar, Eddie rips the top off a box of ammunition and writes a note to the police pleading to be stopped as ""he's going to kill again.""That afternoon, Eddie follows the woman from the bar and shoots her through the window of her apartment. Kafka meets with Inspector Anderson who, in receipt of the box top, orders a roundup of local sex offenders for a lineup from some witnesses. Psychiatrist Dr. James G. Kent tells Kafka that none of the offenders are guilty and later at a restaurant gives Kafka a profile of the murderer as fulfilling a childhood fantasy of killing a particular woman, such as his mother, over and over.Meanwhile, Eddie notices a television program through the window of a store and becomes fixated on society matron Mrs. Fitzpatrick, who is discussing a charity ball. He makes a mental note of her address as she gives it out for tickets. While going through an extensive list of criminal profiles, Kafka and Ferris come across Eddie's record, which lists his assault on a woman with a baseball bat. Just then a report comes in that Mrs. Fitzpatrick has been shot to death. The police are then summoned to a meeting with the mayor and several of the city's political bosses, who demand the killer be found. Dr. Kent grows frustrated when each of the politicos discuss severe punishment for the killer rather than treatment.At the cleaners, Eddie is nagged again by the receptionist, who wonders why Eddie has not changed the dirty bandage on his hand. Later, a woman's body is found shot to death in a local park, and bullet casings and a dirty bandage are discovered nearby. While Eddie burns off his frustration at a local amusement park, Kafka and Ferris have the bandage analyzed and track it to a hospital. There, despite the fact that Eddie registered under another name, the intern identifies him from the photo in his criminal file. When the cleaner's receptionist reads the newspaper story about the latest murder, she immediately reports Eddie's hand injury and erratic behavior.Kafka and Ferris wait for Eddie at the cleaners, but he is on a local rooftop desperately tracking lone women. When a painter working high on an opposite building sees Eddie and calls a warning to those below, Eddie kills him and frantically flees for home.

tt0045537,"['Comedy', 'Musical', 'Romance']","Fred Astaire plays song-and-dance man Tony Hunter, whose top-hat-and-tails brand of movie musical has become pass√©. As the movie opens, a Hollywood memorabilia auctioneer tries to sell off a hat and cane that once belonged to Hunter, but he literally can't get 50 cents for them. His star on the wane, his life at a crossroads, Tony travels to New York by train to take stock and ponder his future. When the train pulls into Grand Central Terminal, he thinks the gaggle of reporters on the platform is there to see him, but it turns out they were waiting for Ava Gardner, who was also on board. A deflated but amused Tony strolls off alone (song: ""By Myself'').Tony's solitude is short-lived -- he receives a raucous welcome inside the station by two of his best friends, Lily and Lester Marton (Nanette Fabray, Oscar Levant), a Broadway show-writing couple. They want Tony to star in a brand-new stage musical they've just completed, and they know who they want to direct it: acclaimed actor-director Jeffery Cordova (Jack Buchanan), who currently has five shows running on Broadway, including Oedipus Rex, which he's starring in himself. Tony, who's never heard of Cordova, listens politely as they stroll along 42nd Street, which Tony barely recognizes after all these years. He sends the Martons ahead to dinner in a taxi so he can spend some quality time in an arcade (song: ""A Shine on Your Shoes'').The Martons take Tony to Oedipus Rex, where they watch from the wings. Tony has trouble believing the star and director of such a serious work would want to do a musical. Tony meets Cordova, who's a little slow to recognize him but then expresses great excitement at the prospect of working with him. Tony asks Cordova if he's truly interested in producing a musical; Cordova insists all theatrical genres are valuable.The Martons pitch the idea of their light, frothy musical: Tony would play an author of children's books who feels he's compromised himself artistically by writing lurid yet lucrative murder mysteries on the side; Lily says his success makes him feel as though he's ""sort of sold his soul to the Devil.'' Jeffrey seizes upon that phrase to offer his vision of what the musical should be: a modern retelling of Faust, with himself playing the Devil in the guise of a book publisher. Lily, Les and Tony are taken aback. Tony doesn't think it will be his kind of musical, but Jeffrey tells him the show will make him a star all over again. As for Tony's insistence that he's ""just an entertainer,'' Jeffrey replies that they're all entertainers (song: ""That's Entertainment!'' ).Cordova sets about lining up financial backers for the play. He also knows who he wants as the leading lady: a rising ballet star named Gabrielle Gerard (Cyd Charisse), even though it's well known that her mentor and boyfriend, Paul Byrd (James Mitchell), won't let her do a Broadway show. Cordova solves that problem by offering Paul the job of choreographing the musical, and finagling Paul into demanding that Gabrielle co-star, or he won't do it. Tony, who goes with the Martons to see Gabrielle perform, thinks she's fabulous but is apprehensive about starring opposite a classically trained -- and noticeably tall -- ballerina. As it turns out, Gabrielle is nervous about working with a Hollywood legend like Tony. Their initial meeting goes badly amid mutual misunderstandings, but by this time the investors are totally sold on the concept, and it's too late to back out.Work begins on the musical, to be called The Band Wagon. Tony feels out of his element, and worse, that he's being patronized by Jeffrey, Paul and Gabrielle. He finally storms out of rehearsal. Lily and Les are concerned about their friend, but end up getting into their own argument. with Les accusing Lily of being overly enthralled by Jeffrey. (The Martons continue to work on the show -- but refuse to talk directly to each other.)Tony throws a temper tantrum in his hotel room. Gabrielle shows up; Tony tries to apologize, but she lets slip that Paul ordered her to apologize to him. They start to bicker again. Gabrielle bursts into tears, saying she knows Tony never wanted her in the show, which a startled Tony denies; for his part, Tony confesses how scared he's been of this project.Setting aside their differences, Tony and Gabrielle decide to find out if they really can dance together. They go for an evening carriage ride in Central Park, chatting and getting to know each other better. Alighting from the carriage, they stroll past a party of dancing couples and reach a clearing where they're alone. And there, they find they can in fact dance together, beautifully (song: ""Dancing in the Dark'').Frantic preparations begin for the show's tryout in New Haven, Connecticut. It's an incredibly complicated production, with a plethora of elaborate sets. When it comes time to rehearse the first act finale, it seems to go smoothly at first, but quickly degenerates into a farce with different parts of the set moving up and down in the wrong directions. The pyrotechics-laden damnation scene (song: ""You and the Night and the Music'') fares little better.The much-anticipated New Haven premiere lays a huge egg (complete with onscreen visual metaphor). Tony shows up for the post-premiere party at a hotel ballroom, but none of the financial backers or other cast members is there. Tony finds the chorus holding a party/wake in one of their rooms, complete with pizza, beer, ham and deviled egg. They warmly greet Tony, who regales them with stories of his early show business career. They're soon joined by Gabrielle as well as Lily and Les, who've patched things up. Clowning around, Tony, Lily and Les perform a comical number (song: ""I Love Louisa'') which cheers everyone up at first. But the mood turns somber over their failed production. Tony makes a decision. He tries calling Jeffrey to tell them they're going ahead with the show, only they're going to return to the Martons' original script and songs. The person on the other end turns out to be a cleaning woman, but it doesn't matter, because Jeffrey entered the room without anyone noticing and has overheard Tony's little speech. Jeffrey admits his approach was wrong, and asks to be a part of the revamped Band Wagon. Gabrielle also insists on staying with the show, even though Paul (who showed up with Jeffrey) demands she withdraw; she watches sadly as Paul walks out.With Tony effectively in charge, the show travels to Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, D.C., and Baltimore. Along the way, the company polishes a series of musical numbers (songs: ""New Sun in the Sky,'' ""I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan,'' ""Louisiana Hayride,'' ""Triplets''). During the train ride from Washington to Baltimore, Tony confesses to Les in private that he's fallen in love with Gabrielle.Opening night on Broadway. It's raining as Tony and Gabrielle arrive at the theater and wish each other luck. Tony awkwardly tries to express his feelings for Gabrielle, but thinks the better of it. In addition to the other musical numbers, the show's pi√®ce de r√©sistance is a spoof of hard-boiled detective novels called ""Girl Hunt'' in which Tony plays private eye Rod Riley; Gabrielle plays two roles, that of an anguished blonde (""scared as a turkey in November'') and a sinister brunette (""She came at me in sections. More curves than a scenic railway'').The Band Wagon proves a hit. Afterward, Tony, in his dressing room, is puzzled by how quiet things are after a successful opening, but tells his valet he's going out to a nightclub to celebrate, even if he's alone (reprise: ""By Myself''). As he exits his dressing room, Tony is startled to find the entire company waiting for him onstage with a surprise party prepared in his honor. Everyone sings, ""For He's a Jolly Good Fellow.'' Gabrielle, speaking for everyone, tells Tony what he means to them -- but she also conveys that she's now in love with Tony, having broken up with Paul. Gabrielle meaningfully concludes, ""The show's going to run a long time. And as far as I'm concerned, it's going to run forever.'' An overjoyed Tony kisses Gabrielle. They then join Jeffrey, Lily, Les and the company for a reprise of ""That's Entertainment!'' as the movie ends."

Two radar operators (Alvin Greenman) and Charlie (James Best) spot the plane on radar and reports its location. Prof. Tom Nesbitt (Paul Christian/Hubschmid) and the military liaison officer Col. Jack Evans (Kenneth Tobey) observe the explosion of a Hydrogen Bomb. Charlie calls Col. Evans to report a very large object spotted on radar, but by the time Evans arrives it's gone. They chalk it up to something being tossed in front of the radar antenna.Nesbitt and Evans are reviewing their test results. George Ritchie (Ross Elliott) states, ""You know, every time one of these things go off, I feel as if were helping to write the first chapter of a new Genesis."" They depart to collect radiation results from forward observation posts. Ice blocks their path by tractor, so they go on foot the final distance. At Post 16 they take a radiation reading and decide it's too high. They decide they should split up; one visit Post 17 and the other Post 18 to limit their radiation exposure. They agree to meet back at Post 16. The weather gets worse. Ritchie spots a large dinosaur and hears its roar. He shouts out to his colleague, but Tom Nesbitt can't hear him. He explores a little further and distracted by the beast falls into a crevice, breaking his leg in the process. Nesbitt completes his task and returns to Post 16 and waits. Ritchie shoots a gun into the air, hoping its loud report will bring help. Nesbitt hears it and responds. Following his tracks left in the snow he finds his colleague. He tries to move him alone, but decides he needs more help. Ritchie tries to warn Nesbitt about ""a prehistoric monster."" Nesbitt attributes his rambling to the cold, pain, and shock. Then Nesbitt hears and sees Ritchie's ""hallucination"" himself. The creature's proximity and weight creates an avalanche that buries Ritchie and nearly kills Nesbitt. Nesbitt is brought back to base, barely alive from shock and exposure. The doctor tells Col. Evans to get him to a hospital in the states immediately. Nesbitt comes to and begins to ramble about Ritchie and a monster. He is flown to New York's Hartley Hospital. After a two week physical recovery he is started on ""Psychiatric Interrogation for Traumatic Hallucinations."" He is introduced to Dr. Ingersoll (King Donovan) who tells him that shock and trauma are the reason behind his dinosaur sighting. Col. Evans arrives to tell him that they found no trace of Ritchie or the beast. His primary care physician, Dr. Morton (Frank Ferguson) insists he rest.The fishing ketch, Fortune, is out in a storm in the North Atlantic. The captain enters the wheelhouse, his first mate Jacob Bowman (Jack Pennick) is at the wheel. Bowman spots something outside and calls for the Captain, abandoning the wheel as he recoils in fear. They hear a roar and see a huge black shape rise up from the ocean. It destroys their vessel and sinks it off the Grand Banks.The next morning Nesbitt is having his breakfast in his hospital room and spots the story in the newspaper. Bowman was the lone survivor of the disaster. Nesbitt dresses and visits the Paleontology Department of a local University. He talks to the department dean, Prof. Thurgood Elson (Cecil Kellaway) and his assistant Miss Lee Hunter (Paula Raymond). Elson is sympathetic but does not believe his story. Nesbitt asks if it is possible that the H-Bomb thawed the 100 million year old ice and freed the dinosaur. Elson does not think it possible a creature frozen for that length of time could survive. Lee Hunter interrupts to mention that a herd of Mastadon were thawed in Siberia after thousands of years, ""yet their fur intact and the meat still edible."" Nesbitt leaves dejected. Dr. Morton examines Nesbitt and tells him he can leave the hospital anytime. The radio is playing in his room and a broadcaster announces a second sea serpent sighting, this time from Marquette, Canada. Capt. George LeMay's ship was destroyed.Nesbitt returns to work at the Atomic Energy Commission, New York Regional Office. His secretary, Miss Ryan, is glad to have him back. She tells him that Lee Hunter is waiting to see him. She brings the newspaper with the LeMay story and tells him it is worth investigating. She's gathered sketches of the known species of dinosaurs and tells him if he can identify the creature that would be proof. That evening they meet at her apartment to look at the sketches. He narrows in on a few likely candidates, and she helps him identify the one he picks as the Rhedosaurus. She tells him if Capt. LeMay can identify the same sketch that would be proof. He calls Canada to talk to the Captain. LeMay (Leo Mostovoy) answers but can only speak French. Nesbitt asks him about the serpent, and the captain promptly hangs up the phone. The operator tells Nesbitt that he won't talk to him further. Nesbitt makes a personal visit but misses him. He speaks to the newspaper editor. He decides to visit Jacob Bowman in the hospital. He convinces Bowman to return to New York and identify the creature.Elson is packing for a vacation; Lee is helping him. He notes that Lee is developing a budding romance with Nesbitt. Nesbitt arrives with Bowman in tow. Bowman reviews the sketches and picks the same creature--the Rhedosaurus. Elson is now convinced, and speaks to Col. Evans on the phone. Evans tells Elson he will check with a friend in the Coast Guard if anything unusual is reported.A lighthouse on the coast of Maine contains a keeper and his assistant. One plays a concertina while the other wipes down the equipment. The creature comes ashore and climbs up the lighthouse, drawn to the beacon. They see it and try to escape down the spiral staircase, but the creature destroys it before they can safely exit.Col. Evans pays a visit to Capt. Philip Jackson (Donald Woods) at his U.S. Coast Guard office. He tells him the story Nesbitt and Elson told him. He asks about any unusual occurrences. That evening at the ballet, Nesbitt and Lee are on a date when Nesbitt is handed a message. They quickly depart and meet with Elson and Evans at Jacksons USCG office. Jackson explains that in addition to the lighthouse, there was shore wreckage in Massachusetts reported. Elson looks at the chart and sees a pattern. It is following the Arctic Current southward. He concludes the beast is heading for New York, its ancestral home. Elson wants to see it before he can formulate a plan to capture the creature alive. He makes arrangements with Jackson for the use of a diving bell.On the ship Elson boards a diving bell for their first drop into the Hudson submarine canyon system. Elson is in communication with Nesbitt on the surface and provides periodic reports of progress. He spots the Rhedosaurus, only the shoulder and the leg, but confirms it is enormous. Then as he describes it to Lee Hunter in more detail, it attacks and chews off the bell from the cable. The newspaper story the next day confirms Elson's death.Longshoremen are working at a New York port facility when the Rhedosaurus comes ashore. What starts as a few people scattering turns into a mob in full panic. People stuck in buildings look on in horror at the panic in the streets and the beast's destruction of property. People abandon their cars on the street and run. A patrolman shoots it with his service revolver, with little effect other than annoying the beast. As he reloads the dinosaur bends down and latches on to him by the head. He lifts him up and swallows him whole to the shock and horror of a woman witness. As it walks the streets of New York it destroys cars, utility poles and buildings. The police respond with greater numbers and rifles. Many people seek refuge in the subway system. The National Guard is called out and the Wall Street and Lower Manhattan area is turned into a battlefield. A newspaper headline indicates 180 dead and 1500 injured during the first rampage. A bazooka team fires a couple of rounds wounding the beast in the neck. The ER doctor (Michael Fox) has concluded that the beast has some very dangerous virus or bacteria in its blood that is fatal to humans. A patrol of soldiers begins collapsing after exposure to large patches of the creature's blood.Evans and Nesbitt discuss how to eliminate the beast. Anything that will spread the blood particles is out. Just as they think the creature may be dying of its wound, it is announced that the beast is alive and ashore at Manhattan Beach at the amusement area. Nesbitt suggests a radioactive isotope shot directly into the wound.The Army arrives at the amusement park. The Rhedosaurus is at the Roller Coaster. They wait for the isotope to be delivered. Evans selects his best marksman, Corp. Stone (Lee Van Cleef) for the job. He and Nesbitt don radiation suits and take a roller coaster car to the top for a better shot. Nesbitt retrieves the isotope from a lead lined container and Stone fires it into the beast's neck wound. He scores a direct hit and the beast, now in great pain, damages some of the wooden framework and rails. The coaster they were riding gets away from them, crashes, and starts a fire. The two men climb down the burning coaster while the beast goes through its death throes. The Rhedosaurus knocks out a section of burning coaster framework and makes its way to the beach and collapses. We close with Nesbitt and Lee embracing, then turning to view the dead dinosaur."

It would seem to be an open-and-shut case, suicide brought on, according to his wife, by concern over health issues. Mrs. Duncan found a letter addressed to the District Attorney on her husband's desk and she opens the sealed envelope, reads the contents and contacts local mob boss Mike Laguna to arrange a meeting. Bannion and the police are then contacted by the late cop's mistress, Lucy Chapman (Dorothy Green), who disputes Duncan's mindset and reported bad health.She explains that Duncan was in perfect health and had no reason to commit suicide. The evidence points clearly to a self-inflicted gunshot wound and Bannion believes that Chapman is trying to make a little money. Bannion is intrigued to learn that the Duncans had a lake property which would have been a challenge on his police salary.Bannion visits Mrs. Duncan (Jeanette Nolan) and raises the subject but she resents the implication of his suspicions. The next day Bannion gets a dressing-down by Lieutenant Ted Wilks (Willis Bouchey) who is under pressure from ""upstairs"" to close the case with as little grief to the widow as possible.Chapman is later found dead after being tortured with cigarette burns. Bannion sets about investigating her murder even though it is not his case or his police force's jurisdiction. A threatening call is made to his home and Bannion goes to confront Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby), the local mob boss. It's an open secret that Lagana runs the city, even to the point that he has cops guarding his house while his daughter hosts a party. Lagana resents Bannion's accusations in his own home during such an event: ""I've seen some dummies in my time, but you're in a class by yourself.""Bannion's main problem is that people are just too scared to stand up to the crime syndicate that controls the city, including Lieutenant Wilks, who fears for his pension and whom Bannion dismisses as a ""leaning tower of jelly"". But when the warnings to him to stop the investigation go unheeded, Bannion's car is rigged with a bomb and his wife (Jocelyn Brando) is killed when she borrows the car.Feeling that the department will do little to bring the perpetrators to justice by focusing on his old arrests and cases and disgusted by Police Commissioner Higgins' (Howard Wendell) cliched condolences, Bannion resigns from the force and sets off on a one-man crusade to get Lagana and his second-in-command Vince Stone (Lee Marvin). He vacates his house, goes to live in a hotel, and sends his young daughter to live with his in-laws for safety. Bannion continues his investigation and uncovers a suspect in the car bombing named Larry who can be contacted at a nightclub and bar.When Stone drunkenly attacks a girl in the nightclub, Bannion who is there looking for a Larry, stands up to him and orders him and his bodyguard out of the joint. This impresses Stone's girlfriend Debby Marsh (Gloria Grahame). Debby, left behind in the bar, tries to get friendly with Bannion and ends up in his hotel room. Bannion Points out that she gets her money from a thief. Marsh states: ""I've been rich and I've been poor. Believe me, rich is better."" But when she unwittingly asks him about his late wife, he sends her packing: ""Oh, well, you're about as romantic as a pair of handcuffs,"" she remarks.Marsh was seen with Bannion by Stone's associate Larry Gordon and when she returns to Stone's penthouse, Stone accuses her of cheating on him with Bannion and throws boiling hot coffee in her face.She is taken to hospital by none other than Commissioner Higgins who was playing poker with Stone and his friends at the penthouse. When Higgins warns that he will have to file a report, Stone reminds him that he pays him to deal with that sort of thing.Her lovely face half-scarred, Marsh returns to Bannion who gets her a room on his floor at the hotel to protect her from the gangsters. He's been looking for a man called Larry who hired a mechanic to set the dynamite in the car that killed his wife. Marsh reveals that it is Larry Gordon (Adam Williams), one of Stone's hirelings.Bannion confronts and strangles Gordon until he admits that he did organize the bombing of his car. Gordon tells Bannion that he arranged the bombing, that Stone killed Conway and that Duncan was on the take and that Bertha Duncan, widow of the cop who committed suicide, has information that could expose Lagana.Bannion has been warned by Marsh that killing for revenge would make him no better than those who killed his wife. He thus refrains from killing Gordon, instead threatening to spread the word that he talked. Gordon is seized and murdered by Stone before he can leave town and make his escape.Bannion now goes to confront Mrs. Duncan accusing her of betraying Chapman to her death and of protecting ""Lagana and Stone for the sake of a soft plush life"". Mrs. Duncan had called Lagana when Bannion arrived outside her house and he advised her to stall for time. A couple police arrive and Bannion is forced to leave. Bannion had been in the process of strangling Mrs. Duncan to get her to confess and because he believes that if she dies the information she has on Lagana will be released publicly. Bannion returns to his hotel and tells Debby about the Duncans and how he had just about killed Mrs. Duncan. Bannion then gets a call from his sister-in-law.Stone decides to try and kidnap Bannion's little daughter Joyce (Linda Bennett) who is staying with her aunt and uncle with a police guard outside their apartment. When the guards are called off by Lagana through his police contacts, the uncle calls in a few army buddies to take over. Satisfied that she is in good hands, Bannion sets off to deal with Stone. On the way he meets Lieutenant Wilks, the ""leaning tower of jelly"", who is now prepared to make a stand against the mob, admitting that, in spite of his own wife's pressure over what will happen to his pension, ""It's the first time in years I've breathed good clean air.""Debby Marsh, slowly coming to terms with her disfigurement, confronts Mrs. Duncan. They've both benefited from their association with mobsters as can be seen by their very-similar and expensive mink coats: ""We're sisters under the mink,"" says Marsh. She then kills Mrs. Duncan, thus starting the process that will see Tom Duncan's evidence surface and bring about Stone and Lagana's downfall. When Stone returns to his penthouse, a hidden and waiting Marsh throws boiling coffee in his face, like he did to her.Stone shoots Marsh and then Bannion arrives and during a short gun battle Debby admits she killed Mrs. Duncan. Stone is eventually captured by Bannion. As Marsh lies dying, Bannion describes his late wife to her in terms of their relationship rather than the physical ""police description"" he gave earlier: ""You and Katie would have gotten along fine,"" he tells her.Stone is arrested for Marsh's murder. When Duncan's evidence is made public Lagana and Commissioner Higgins are indicted. Bannion returns to his job at Homicide."

The following morning her uncle, Whitney Cameron (known as Whit), arrives at the hospital. By this time Polly is stable. Lynne asks Whit if he can stay for a while to spend time with Polly and her younger brother Doug. Whit agrees and later stops by to visit his friends, Maggie and Fred Sargent. Fred is the family attorney and Maggie is a journalist. When Whit mentions Polly's strange symptoms and how she did not want her feet touched, Maggie is reminded of a case long ago. She promises to do some research. Whit is not really concerned because Polly is recovering.That night Whit has dinner with Lynne and Doug. He suggests that Doug spend the upcoming summer with him. Lynne initially agrees. Then the hospital calls. Polly has had a relapse. By morning she is dead.Whit again visits the Sargents. Maggie has information about a man who died from strychnine poisoning. He kept saying ""Don't touch my hands!"" She suggests that Lynne may have poisoned Polly. Whit scoffs at the idea, mentioning how close Lynne was to the children and how well she treated them. Maggie points out that history has had other female murderers who were like Lynne: cultured, beautiful, and intelligent. Whit finds himself becoming suspicious. Fred points out that under the terms of Whit's brother's will, Lynne has only a small income. She would not inherit the entire estate unless both of the children died.Lynne decides to take Doug to Europe for a year instead of letting him spend the summer with his uncle. There is nothing that Whit can do to prevent it, since his brother's will gives custody to Lynne. Whit talks to the doctors and nurses who took care of his niece. The child received only medication from the hospital pharmacy. Lynne refused to permit an autopsy. She wanted the child cremated but Whit talked her out of it. He felt it was not what his brother would have wanted.By now the Sargents and Whit fear for Doug's safety. They are afraid he will mysteriously die while in Europe. Polly's body is exhumed for an autopsy. Whit conceals this from Lynne until the results are in. Polly died of strychnine poisoning.The police interview the servants and Lynne but come up with nothing. No one would admit to giving Polly anything to eat on the night she took sick. Lynne is very cooperative and even suggests hiring a private investigator. Whitney discovers that the pills given to Polly on the day she died were from a different pharmacy, since the one at the hospital was closed. Lynne was on her way home to pick up some things for Polly and offered to have it filled. There seems little doubt that she was involved. She is furious when she learns that Whit is behind the investigation. After interviewing her again, the police arrest her and a hearing is held to see if their is enough evidence to charge her.Doug is told nothing of what is going on. The Sargents take care of him until the hearing is over. There simply isn't enough evidence for a conviction and Lynne is free to go. Whit tries and fails to get emergency custody of Doug. He knows of only one way to keep Doug safe and that is to kill Lynne. He purchases a bottle of rat poison. The store clerk shows him the same thing in tablet form. Whit notices how they look just like aspirin tablets except for the ""W"" stamped on each one, to represent the company that manufactured them.Whit books passage on the same ship that Lynne and Doug are on. Once in his cabin, he pours the rat poison into a different bottle and conceals it a pocket. He still isn't sure if he can carry out his plan. Doug is pleased to see Whit but Lynne is not. Whit apologizes to her for all that happened and sweet-talks her, giving her the impression that he is interested in her romantically. Later he loses his nerve and tosses the bottle of rat poison into the sea.On the last night of the voyage, Whit goes to Lynne's stateroom to retrieve her coat.

They kiss and he orders drinks from the bar. Behind Lynne's back he dissolves one of the ""W"" tables into her drink. She complains of the bitter taste and Whit says his is bitter too. After she finishes the drink, he tells he what he did and that she only has a few minutes before the poison takes effect. Lynne angrily denies having anything to do with Polly's death and says the ""W"" tablets are from an old bottle that she combined with a new bottle. Whit reminds her of the ticking clock and that she can still be saved. She orders him to leave and goes into her bedroom. To her shock a man is sitting there. He identifies himself as the ship's detective and that Mr. Cameron called him to witness the conversation. The men wait as the minutes tick by. Lynne shows no symptoms of having been poisoned.

Whit replies that he gave her a pill from her aspirin bottle.After ten minutes pass and Lynne is still fine, she orders them to leave. The detective tells Whit that he will have to write up a report of the evening's events. Whit goes out on deck, shocked that the ""W"" pill hadn't been strychnine after all.

tt0045699,"['SciFi', 'Horror']","The movie opens with the credits and the title over a train approaching and stopping at a station. Sitting in a car, waiting for her husband, is Janice Cory (Nancy Reagan, credited as Nancy Davis). Dr. Patrick J. Cory (Lew Ayres) has just arrived on the train. They drive home to a remote spot outside of town in Green Valley. Cory brought a monkey home, and Janice is concerned because it is cold. They walk in the house and Cory calls for his alcoholic assistant, Dr. Frank Schratt (Gene Evans). He is passed out in front of the fireplace. Cory tells his wife to put on some coffee, he needs Schratt's assistance and sober. Janice brings the monkey into the lab. Cory and Schratt are already there and washing up. Their goal is to extract the monkey's brain and keep it alive; four previous attempts on older subjects were failures. In a large fish tank they place the monkey brain. They hook it up to various support equipment, but initially there is no activity. They increase the voltage and a strong alpha wave appears and remains steady. Janice starts taking notes as her husband dictates details of the procedure. The phone rings, it is the chief ranger asking for Dr. Cory's help. There has been an airplane crash. Some of the passengers may still be alive.At the crash scene, Cory meets the ranger and some other men. They carry the body away from the smoking wreckage on a stretcher. He examines the man and says he'll never make it to a hospital. Chief Tuttle (James Anderson credited as Kyle James) suggests they take him to Cory's house. His house has a lab with a fully equipped Operating Room. Cory thinks the chances are slim, but worth it. At the house, the men carry the body directly to the lab. Tuttle informs Cory, ""If you pull him through Doc you'll be set for life. That's Warren H. Donovan. He's supposed to be worth a hundred million."" Donovan is in very bad shape, both legs gone and his chest is crushed. Cory and Schratt operate but his pulse stops. Cory asks Schratt to make out the death certificate. Schratt is a practicing physician, but Tuttle has it out for him. He called for Schratt at the hospital, but Schratt was at the Cory home and drunk. Tuttle has an ulterior motive for his hostility towards Schratt; he wants his brother to have Schratt's job at the hospital. Cory walks away from the operating table and gets an idea. He checks and finds alpha waves present on the recently deceased Mr. Donovan. He talks Frank Schratt into helping him remove Donovan's brain. Frank and Janice are horrified. Janice points out that it is against the law, and he could lose his medical license.Now a human brain occupies the fish tank in the lab. Cory explains his goal, ""If this brain lives, maybe we can discover how it thinks."" Schratt finishes his drink and leaves for home. Schratt returns a few days later to drop off some chemicals, and collect Dr. Cory. They have to go to town and see the hospital administrator, Higgins (Stapleton Kent) and Webster (Peter Adams). Cory is there to vouch for Schratt's professional competency. Higgins seems to be satisfied and tells Cory that Donovan's son and daughter are waiting to see him. Dr. Cory assures Donovan's children, Chloe (Lisa Howard) and Tom (Michael Colgan) that everything possible was done for their father. They ask about any communication he may have made or if any papers were found with his body. Cory then meets with the press. He is asked about Tuttle's brother replacing Schratt at the hospital. As he is leaving, Herbie Yocum (Steve Brodie) introduces himself. He is a freelance photographer. He is following Donovan's death. He wants to get a photo of the operating table. He already visited the morgue and noticed that Donovan had stitches in his head, even though the plane crash injuries did not involve his head. Suspecting Yocum knows more than he admits, Cory reluctantly agrees to Yocum's unusual and ghoulish request. Yocum takes his pictures of the table and another of the tank with Donovan's brain.The brain is starting to respond to outside stimuli. By the seventh day, the brain is growing and absorbing nutrients. Cory suggests they give the brain a voice, so they can hear it anywhere in the house. Schratt returns to the Cory home with a suitcase. He was fired from the hospital and will live with the Cory's full time. Cory wants to research Donovan's life. He wants to try telepathy to communicate with the brain. Frank and Janice think this is a very foolish and unproductive use of his time. The research yields a very unflattering picture of W.H. Donovan. He was a very unpleasant and unscrupulous individual; even his children hated the man. He was a tax cheat and the IRS had an ongoing case against him. That was his focus of attention when he was involved in the plane crash.Cory goes into the lab to check on the brain. A few hours later Cory is still there. The brain in the tank is pulsating. Cory's left hand begins to twitch. He sits at his desk and begins to write something with his left hand, then falls asleep. Dr. Schratt returns the next morning from fishing. Janice, still in her robe, complains that her husband never came to bed. Cory picks up some papers and asks, ""Did you write this?"" The note states, ""get to N. Fuller, WH Donovan."" Janice and Frank deny knowledge. Cory get up and bolts from the room with the note in hand. In the living room he looks for a sample of Donovan's handwriting and signature. He finds a magazine article and compares the two--they match.Cory tries to find out who this N. Fuller is. He drives into town, but even at that distance, the brain calls him home. Cory is now walking with a limp and rubbing his side as Donovan did in life. The brain falls asleep and Cory returns to normal. Janice and Frank try to convince Cory he's being drawn in a little too far with his experiment. Cory is then repossessed and orders a taxi and charters a private plane. He flies to Los Angeles and checks into a hotel and bumps into Yocum and brushes him off. He stops at a bank and tries to make a large withdrawal of cash. Yocum is watching him from outside. The teller directs him to the bank manager, Mr. MacNish (John Hamilton), who asks for identification. Since the customers account was always accessed by mail, MacNish has no way to verify things. Cory withdraws $27,000 and leaves the bank. MacNish immediately calls the Treasury Department to report. Cory's next stop is the Aloe Supply Company. He orders scientific equipment and pays cash and orders it delivered to his home back in Green Valley. He stops at a tailor and orders six suits and demands one be available by morning. He orders a fabric that was the favorite of Donovan. As usual, Yocum is outside watching each transaction.At the law offices of Fuller, Barton & Fuller, Cory pays a visit and asks for Nathaniel Fuller. He is told Fuller will be tied up until after lunch. After an exchange with the secretary and Fuller over the intercom, Fuller (Victor Sutherland) reluctantly agrees to see Cory. Cory convinces Fuller to get Donovan's ""Washington Advisor"" to meet under threat of blackmail--something about endorsed checks. Yocum is still following Cory around town and follows him back to the hotel.Two treasury agents, Mr. Smith (Paul Hoffman) and Brooke (Harland Warde) pay Cory a vist in his hotel room. He refuses to answer their questions. When they threaten to have him arrested, he throws them out. Yocum enters as the treasury agents leave. He shows Cory an article he wrote on Donovan's brain, clearly blackmail. Cory returns to Green Valley by private plane late that afternoon.Janice and Frank examine the brain. Cory comes in still possessed as Donovan. The brain falls asleep and Cory returns to himself. Frank tells Cory that he thinks the brain was reading his mind and knew he meant it harm. The equipment he ordered as Donovan arrives. He got an automatic feeder, good for a year; amplifiers for increasing the brains output; temperature control, and a generator for uninterrupted power.The next morning, Frank goes to the garage and tries to force the lock on the new power supply. The brain wakes Cory and sends him out to stop Schratt. Cory attacks Schratt, but Janice breaks it up. Cory flies back to the city and makes a list of banks, bank balances, and assumed names of the account holders. The Washington Advisor (Tom Powers) and Fuller keep their appointment with Cory. Cory discusses Donovan's tax problem. The advisor tells Cory he has already spoken to the Attorney General about the situation and since Donovan is dead, so is the problem. Cory disagrees and tells him the $250,000 will be paid in cash and the arrangements will continue as usual. The meeting ends and the two men leave. What they don't realize is that Cory recorded the entire exchange on tape. Cory nearly collapses and puts in a call to his wife, but the long distance lines are busy. He records his message to his wife at the end of the exchange with the two men. He tells his wife he is finding it harder to resist Donovan's influence, and may not return to be himself again. He tells her his plan to use the lightning rod on the house.Cory leaves the hotel and takes a cab. He is followed. He exits the cab and is hit by a truck. He is taken to a local hospital. Back at the lab, Frank notes that the brain hasn't rested for over 30 hours. It is growing larger in size in the fish tank. Janice visits Cory in the hospital. Dr. Crane (William Cottrell) briefs Janice and tells her Cory has a mild concussion and a bruised leg. The medical staff is surprised at how well he tolerates pain. Cory, as himself, tells Janice he is afraid. Donovan takes back over and Cory tells Janice to get out and go back home. Janice calls Frank at tells him to turn down the voltage to the brain by 10 microvolts. She wants to know when the brain falls asleep so she can talk to Dr. Pat Cory as himself. The brain won't allow Frank to adjust the machine.The Donovan children and Fuller pay Cory a visit in his hospital room. They tell Cory they want to cooperate with the government on the back tax issue. Cory as Donovan is furious, and cuts them off financially and throws them out of his room. Yocum pays him visit a bit later. He wants another ""advance"" of $2000. Cory sends him to the house for a few more pictures then calls Frank to give him instructions to leave Yocum in the lab alone with the brain. Yocum arrives at the house and in the lab the brain hypnotizes him. He exits the house like a zombie. Schratt sees him leave, but just goes back to napping in the living room. Yocum drives away but nods off behind the wheel and crashes and burns his car. One blackmailer down.Cory, as Donovan, leaves the hospital. Janice had been napping in the waiting area, but she sees him limp away. He cashes a number of checks and gathers the blackmail funds in cash. He gives Fuller the cash. He warns Fuller, ""A fatal accident will occur to anyone who stands in my way."" Cory now sees Janice and Frank as standing in his way. Janice and Frank discuss a plan to eliminate the brain. He wants Jan to distract Cory, get him angry, so he can put a bullet in the brain. A storm approaches as Cory arrives home. He agrees to take a walk with his wife, limping like Donovan. Jan has it out with Donovan. As Donovan, Cory attacks his wife while Schratt pumps a couple of bullets into the brain. The brain has Schratt turn the gun on himself. Cory and Janice find Schratt in the lab on the floor. A bolt of lightning strikes the house and blows out the equipment supporting the brain. The brain catches fire and is destroyed.Later, the Treasury agents come to collect Cory. Brooke tells Janice that Dr. Pat Cory's fate is up to both the medical board and whether or not he is indicted. Frank managed to survive and goes with Cory and the Treasury agents. We close with them driving away from the house."
tt0045737,"['Western', 'contentRating', 'Passed']","The year is 1863. The Civil War still rages. Far off in the Arizona desert, captured Confederate soldiers are being held at Fort Bravo by their Union captors. Surrounding them all is the monumental, inhospitable terrain and the implacably hostile Mescalero Apaches.Captain Roper (William Holden) of the US Army drags an escaped Confederate prisoner named Bailey back to the fort on a rope behind his horse. As they enter the grounds, the prisoners in the stockade resentfully glare at Roper. Roper tells his commanding officer that the man had ridden his horse until it gave out and left it to die, then fled on foot before being ridden down. Roper finds that his brutal tactics are unpopular with his commanding officer, his second-in-command Lieutenant Beecher (Richard Anderson), and the post's doctor. The post commander pointedly reminds Roper that the prisoners nearly outnumber the garrison. Roper admits that his actions are designed to intimidate the restless prisoners and keep them in check.Confederate Captain Marsh (John Forsythe) asks Roper for permission to see Bailey, which Roper grants. The young man is in a bad way, exhausted and dehydrated. He apologizes for his foolhardy solo escape attempt but couldn't wait for the pending larger attempt. Some of the more aggressive prisoners question Marsh's delay in staging a larger escape.Roper leads a mounted patrol into the desert to locate an overdue supply convoy carrying rifles to the fort. They find the wagons overturned and burned, the drivers tortured to death on ant mounds. As the slain men are being laid to rest, Roper notices smoke and mirror signals in the distance. An attack is imminent. On the return to the Fort they are ambushed and Beecher takes an arrow to the shoulder as the surprise attack commences. The Mescaleros wheel around the surrounded troopers, inflicting and incurring several casualties. The Apaches soon retreat into the distance and the patrol heads out to the nearest water hole.As night falls, the soldiers make camp and almost immediately hear gunfire. A band of Apaches is pursuing a stagecoach through the desert, with both the shotgun guard and a passenger returning fire. Roper' sends his men to intervene and drive off the attackers. The stagecoach is escorted to the camp, where the beautiful Carla Forester (Eleanor Parker) alights and introduces herself to Roper. She explains that she was on her way to Fort Bravo to see the colonel and his engaged daughter who is soon to be married to Lt. Beecher. Carla dresses Beecher's wound and explains that she went to school with the colonel's daughter, Alice (Polly Bergen).The next evening, sparks fly between the aggressively flirtatious Carla and an amused Captain Roper as she escorts him to his quarters. He agrees to accompany her, when asked, to the post dance the next evening. At the dance, Carla expresses surprise that a pair of Confederate officers have been permitted to attend. One of them is Captain Marsh, who gallantly asks her to dance with him. As they dance closely together, it is revealed that they are in fact lovers, and she has come to the fort to aid in his escape. The breakout is planned for the night of Lt. Beecher's wedding to Alice.Following the dance, Roper takes Carla to see his prized rose garden on the way back to her quarters. Surprised by this softer side of the stern captain, she asks about his late father. He slowly starts to reveal a human side as he falls for her. The next day, Carla and Alice depart for a nearby town to shop for a wedding dress. Roper unexpectedly and inconveniently volunteers to accompany them. Roper and three troopers escort the carriage. In town, Roper accompanies Carla to a dry goods store run by a Mr. Watson, a Confederate sympathizer who has agreed to provide supplies for the escape attempt. While Roper is distracted, she covertly slips Watson a wad of cash and describes the clothing, provisions, horses, and guns that will be required. Watson is to prepare the supplies and on the night of the wedding conceal the escapees in his wagon to leave the fort. After returning to the fort, Roper accompanies Carla on a ride into the beautiful rock formations above the fort. Roper comes on to her and embraces her. She fights him at first but then willingly submits as they kiss passionately.After Beecher and Alice's wedding, Roper tells a conflicted Carla that he in love with her, asking her to stay on and marry him. Meanwhile, the four escapees (including Marsh and Bailey) have climbed into the back of Watson's covered supply wagon. Carla tells Roper that she needs to be alone to think. After he leaves, she runs to the supply wagon and tells Marsh she is going with them. Roper pointedly questions the nervous Watson as he exits with the concealed prisoners and Carla in his wagon.The next morning, the escape is reported. Roper is stunned and bitter at Carla's deception. He is to lead a detail in pursuit of the escapees and Beecher, even though just married, is concerned about Roper's methods and forces his way onto the patrol. Bailey is captured in a saloon, as Roper has judged him to be too cowardly to ride out into the desert again. Another army patrol has been attacked and Roper sends his troops to help them and continues on with just Beecher, the Kiowa scout and Bailey. Out on the desert, Carla seems distracted, and Captain Marsh suspects that she has true feelings for Roper. Roper's pursuit group soon sneaks up on the Confederates' campsite and gets the drop on them. Marsh, upset by losing his girl, hits Roper resulting in a fistfight, with Roper winning handily. Roper gathers up his prisoners and starts back for the fort.Watching from atop the spectacular desert rock formations, the Mescaleros discover Roper's outnumbered party and attack. The group is forced to dismount and take cover in the open in a small defile. Roper arms the Rebs and they acquit themselves well, but the group is hopelessly surrounded and their Kiowa scout killed. As night falls, Bailey bolts from the ditch and flees on one of their horses which has returned. The others curse him as a coward. The following morning, the Apaches attack again, wounding Beecher and one of the Rebels. During the attack, the Apaches curiously bracket the soldiers' position by thrusting lances into the soil around their position. No one knows why. The reason soon becomes apparent as single arrows are carefully lobbed from the surrounding cliffs, registering the distance to Roper's band. Deadly volleys of arrows soon follow, cascading down onto the group. Captain Marsh, Beecher, and others are hit. Two of the Confederates desperately leap from cover to knock down the lances guiding the archers. Both are shot dead. Roper makes his own dash and finishes the task, but the end is near.As night falls, Marsh uses a gun to try to force Roper and Carla to leave together, telling Roper that she fell in love with him and now he has to save her, but Marsh collapses before they can leave. With Marsh and Beecher near death, Roper realizes that his only remaining option is to pretend the others are all dead and break cover himself to face the Apaches and hope they leave the rest to rot and move on. At dawn, he sprinkles Marsh and Beecher with dirt and tells a tearful Carla to play dead. As he walks out of the defile, with two drawn pistols, he is shot twice and collapses. Suddenly, there is a distant bugle call and the Apaches flee past him. The cavalry has arrived. Bailey was not a coward after all; he had ridden to the fort and brought help back. Roper, Carla and Beecher are saved, but it is too late for Captain Marsh, who dies after congratulating Bailey."

He soon picks up the vibes from overhearing conversations: England is in deep trouble. As he investigates further, it becomes clear that people are not talking about the country, but the national cricket team, who are facing a tricky task in the penultimate day of the final test against Australia at the Oval. Sam Palmer (Jack Warner) is a successful veteran professional cricketer on the point of retirement; in fact the final test is his last game for England and the last match of his career. A widower, he lives with his sister, who keeps house for him, and his son Reg, a teenage aesthete, whose artistic interests include drama and poetry but not cricket. Despite his aunt's pressure, Reg would rather compose deathless verse to send to his hero, the dramatist Alexander Whitehead (Robert Morley), than watch his father's last outing for England. Sam is in at number 5 and isn't required to bat on the fourth day, and, disappointed that Reg has failed to attend and lied to him into the bargain, extracts a promise that Reg will attend the final day, when Sam will be definitely be batting. He then takes his trouble to girlfriend Cora, who is getting frustrated at the lack of progress in her relationship with Sam. Meanwhile Reg is invited to meet the irascible Whitehead at his house outside London. He goes down in the morning but Whitehead has changed his mind, until, that is, he realises that Reggie Palmer is the son of the great Sam Palmer. Reg and Whitehead rush to the Oval and are in time to see Sam's last innings. Taking the crease just before lunch, he survives three balls but is out LBW on the fourth. To the Senator's astonishment, this losing performance is greeted by a wildly enthusiastic standing ovation by the Australian players and the entire crowd. After the match, a suddenly humble Whitehead explains how the 'non-creative' art of the great cricketer is superior to the creative art of the writer - it leaves no objective record behind so will grow in stature as the years pass.

Warden, however, knowing of Holmes' unfair treatment and realizing Prewitt is a thirty-year soldier (career soldier), suggests that he try to entice Prewitt to change his mind by doubling up on company punishment. The other non-commissioned officers assist in the conspiracy with brutal hazing rituals. Prewitt is supported only by his friend, Private Angelo Maggio (Frank Sinatra).Meanwhile, behind his commander's back, Warden begins an affair with Holmes' neglected wife Karen (Deborah Kerr). Sergeant Maylon Stark (George Reeves) has told Warden of Karen's many affairs with other soldiers at Fort Bliss, including his own. As their relationship develops, Warden asks Karen about her numerous affairs to test her sincerity with him. Karen relates that Holmes had been unfaithful to her most of their marriage. She lost a baby when Holmes came back from one affair drunk, and unable to assist her to the hospital. She then affirms her genuine love for Warden.Prewitt and Maggio spend their liberty time at the New Congress Club, a gentleman's club in downtown Honululu where Prewitt meets, and falls for, Lorene (Donna Reed), a local dancer and call girl. Prewitt confides to Lorene the reason he refuses to box for the company is that he blinded a close friend while sparring. Maggio encounters Sergeant 'Fatso' Judson (Ernest Borgnine), a crass and racist sergeant at the club. When Maggio complains that Judson's piano playing is interfering with his dancing, the two nearly come to blows. Maggio is told that Judson is the Sergeant of the Guard at the stockade.Later, at a tavern called ""Choy's,"" located near the base, Judson sees Maggio holding a photograph of his family. Judson makes an inappropriate comment to Prewitt about Maggio's sister causing Maggio to smash a bar stool on Judson's head. Judson pulls a switchblade on Maggio, but Warden, sitting in a corner, intervenes to save Maggio by telling Judson that killing Maggio would ""create two weeks of paperwork"" for him. When the brutal Judson advances on Warden with the knife, Warden breaks a beer bottle in two and uses the jagged edge as a weapon. Judson retreats, throws down his knife and goes to the bar for a drink. However, he warns Maggio that sooner or later Maggio would end up in the stockade and he would be there waiting for him.A few days later, Karen tells Warden that if he became an officer, she could divorce Holmes and they could return to the States and marry. Warden is not keen on the idea because of his dislike of officers, but agrees to consider the matter.Prewitt manages a weekend pass, courtesy of Warden, and goes to meet Lorene who is too busy at the club to talk. However, she meets him later at a bar for a drink. He tells Lorene he loves the Army, and shows Lorene his prized possession, a bugle mouthpiece. He tells her, ""I played taps last Armistice Day at Arlington National Cemetery. The President was there."" Maggio then walks in drunk and in uniform, explaining that he was assigned to for guard duty that night, but deserted his post. Lorene encourages Prewitt to take Maggio back to the base. While Prewitt is calling for a taxi, Military Police arrive and arrest Maggio, and he is sentenced to six months in the stockade for desertion.Matters come to a head for Prewitt when Sergeant Galovitch picks a fight with Prewitt while on yard detail, and the two come to blows. At first, Galovitch repeatedly pummels Prewitt, who initially refuses to fight back, and then resorts to using only body blows. But as Galovitch and others watching continue taunting him, he begins boxing, hitting Galovitch in the face and nearly managing to knock him out before Holmes finally steps in and stops the fight. When Galovitch falsely accuses Prewitt of insubordination, Holmes is about to punish Prewitt again until the man in charge of the detail says that it was Galovitch, not Prewitt, who was spoiling for the fight. Instead of punishing Galovitch, Holmes abruptly lets him off the hook and disperses the crowd. The entire incident is witnessed by the base commander, who orders an investigation by the Inspector General. When Holmes' true intentions are revealed, the general orders a court-martial. When Holmes begs for an alternative, the commanding officer's aide suggests that Holmes resign his commission ""for the good of the service"" and leaves the Army, which the general accepts with dispatch. Holmes' replacement, Captain Ross, orders that Sergeant Galovitch be demoted to private and put in charge of the latrine.One evening, a few weeks later, Maggio manages to escape from the stockade and find Prewitt. He tells of the abuse he endured by Judson, then dies in Prewitt's arms. The next morning, Prewitt plays taps as tears stream down his cheeks. Seeking revenge, Prewitt tracks down Judson in town and invites him into a back alley to talk, then attacks him. The two fight with switchblades, Prewitt using the very same switchblade Judson had pulled on Maggio earlier. Prewitt kills Judson, but not before sustaining a serious stomach wound. Prewitt goes into hiding at Lorene's apartment. Despite Prewitt's AWOL status, his platoon sergeant carries him ""present"" for three days at Warden's direction. Lorene, whose real name is Alma, tends to Prewitt's wounds.On December 7, 1941, the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor. Enemy planes also attack nearby Wheeler Air Base as well as the barracks. Warden leads several of his men in battle by climbing to the roofs of the barracks and returns fire against strafing Japanese fighter planes, shooting down at least one of them.That evening, Prewitt, still weak from his unhealed wound, finds out about the attack over the radio, and attempts to return to camp under cover of darkness, despite protests from Lorene to wait until daylight. During the walk back to the barracks, Prewitt is spotted by several jittery sentries on the lookout for saboteurs. Instead of stopping and identifying himself to the sentries, Prewitt attempts to run and gets shot dead while running across a golf course, his body landing in a nearby sand trap. Warden arrives on the scene a few minutes later with military investigators and identifies the body. Warden laments Prewitt's stubbornness and states the irony that because of the attack, the December 15, 1941 boxing tournament has been canceled.Holmes' resignation results in Karen having to return to the States with him. When she finds out that Warden failed to apply for officer status, she realizes they will never be together.In the final scene, Lorene and Karen meet for the first (and only) time on a ship leaving for the mainland. Karen then tosses two leis into the water. She tells Lorene, ""If the leis go to shore, a person will return to Hawaii. If the leis float out to sea, a person will never return."" Lorene says she will never return to Hawaii, telling Karen that her fiance was an Army Air Corps pilot who was killed in a B-17 plane during the December 7th attack. Lorene quotes: ""he was awarded the Silver Star, they sent it to his mother. She wrote me. She wanted me to have it. They are very fine people, Southern people. He was named after a general. Robert E. Lee Prewitt."" Karen recognizes Prewitt's name from conversations with Warden and is aware that Lorene is lying about Prewitt's death, but she says nothing. The final shot shows Lorene holding Prewitt's treasured bugle mouth piece."

tt0045883,"['Drama', 'Romance', 'War', 'Western']","At a remote ranch in the desert of New Mexico, homesteader Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page) and her six year-old son Johnny (Lee Aaker) come upon a stranger (John Wayne) drinking water from their river, carrying only a saddle and a rifle. The man tells them only his last name, Lane, and that he is part Apache and was exploring Indian Territory as a US Army Cavalry scout. His horse was stolen a few days earlier, and offers US Army scrip in exchange for one of her horses. Angie tells Lane that her ranch hand had quit recently and hadn't had a chance to break one of her two horses for riding, so Lane offers to break the horse himself. He also asks where her husband is, and she says he is hunting in the mountains and should be back soon.Johnny watches with fascination as Lane takes one of the horses, and saddles and rides the bucking and untamed animal with ease. Lane also offers to do a few chores around the ranch, including sharpening an axe blade and chopping firewood. Lane deduces by the neglected work around the ranch that her husband has not been at the ranch for some time, a fact she is forced to admit. When night falls and the weather grows inclement, Angie offers to put Lane up in her home on a floor bed in the corner. Angie discovers that the butt of his rifle is inscribed to ""Hondo"" Lane, a name she knows to belong to a criminal, and she pulls a pistol on him and fires, but there is no cartridge in the first chamber. She had left it empty so that Johnny wouldn't shoot it accidentally.Hondo returns to his Cavalry post, leaving Angie and Johnny alone at the ranch, where he meets up with his scout sidekick Buffalo Baker (Ward Bond) and reports to his commanding officer that the Chiricauhua Apache lodges in the area are banding together and attacking settlers. At the ranch, Angie and Johnny are surrounded by menacing Apaches led by Chief Vittorio (Michael Pate) and his sub-chief, Silva (Rodolfo Acosta). Angie is not nervous as she has always let them water their horses at her ranch and they had never hurt her. On this occasion, they threaten and grab Angie. Johnny emerges from the house with the loaded pistol and shoots at Silva, hitting and breaking his weapon. Vittorio is impressed by Johnny's bravery, and makes him an Apache blood brother by cutting Johhny's thumb with a knife and giving him an Apache name. Vittorio wonders where Angie's husband is, and she tells him that he will return soon. Vittorio tells her that the boy needs a father to guide him, and unless her husband returns soon, she must take an Apache husband.A night or two later in a saloon, Hondo calls a friend from his poker game, but one of the poker party objects. He and Hondo get into a fight, and Hondo beats the man up badly, driving him out the door. Buffalo Baker tells Hondo the man called himself ""Ed Lowe"" (Leo Gordon), and Hondo suspects he might be Angie's missing husband. Feeling guilty, he leaves the fort to return Angie's horse back to her. Seeking revenge for the bar beating, Lowe and an accomplice follow Hondo through the desert as he makes his way back to Angie's ranch. Hondo camps near a river but leaves it when he detects three Indians stalking him nearby. Lowe enters the camp and he and his friend are attacked by two Indians. The friend is killed, but Hondo shoots and kills an Apache about to kill Lowe. Lowe is briefly grateful but turns his gun on Hondo in retaliation for the bar beating. Hondo defends himself, killing Lowe. Hondo finds a photo of Johnny alongside Lowe's body, confirming that Lowe is Johnny's father and Angie's husband.Continuing towards Lowe's ranch, Hondo runs into an Apache party, who pursue Hondo through the desert. He kills several but they eventually capture him. They take Hondo to the top of a nearby mesa when Vittorio appears. They stake him out and begin to torture and prepare to kill him because he is an Army scout. An Indian shows Vittorio the picture of Johnny from Hondo's saddlebag, and Vittoria thinks Hondo is Angie's husband. He orders the Indians to untie him and declares that he must fight Silva for honor, as he is one of Angie's potential suitors. Hondo and Silva fight using knives. Silva wounds Hondo in the shoulder, but Hondo pins Silva to the ground. Hondo puts his knife to Silva's throat, but Vittoria steps forward and Hondo spares Silva's life, temporarily buying his own life in return. Vittorio takes Hondo to Angie's ranch, and when Vittoria asks if Hondo is her husband, she lies, saving Hondo. The Chief warns Hondo to raise Johnny in the Apache way and leaves them.While Hondo recuperates from his wounds, he shows her the picture of Johnny that he tells her he took from Lowe's body. She asks if he died well, and Hondo pauses before saying that he had. Over the next few weeks, Hondo and Angie grow closer. Hondo and Angie express their growing love for each other. Hondo attempts to reveal the truth of her husband's death, but is interrupted by Vittorio's sudden appearance. Vittorio tells them that the pony soldiers will soon return. He asks Hondo not to join them and to keep the Indian's location a secret. Hondo promises to do the first but not the latter, and Vittoria shows respect for Hondo's truthfulness. Angie tells him she loves him, and they cement their relationship with a kiss.The Army arrives at the ranch, commanded by an ambitious, inexperienced young Lt. McKay (Tom Irish) and accompanied by scouts Baker and Lennie (James Arness). McKay is determined to take all the settlers in the area back to the Army post to protect them and defend the territory against Apache attacks. Lennie reveals that he discovered Lowe's body and matched the horse tracks to Hondo's horse. He wants Hondo's Winchester rifle in exchange for keeping quiet about how Hondo bushwhacked Lowe. Angie overhears Lennie's demands.Hondo prepares to leave, but before he goes, he tells her the truth about her husband's death. Hondo is also intent on telling Johnny, but she persuades him not to, telling Hondo she didn't love her husband any longer and had grown tired of his womanizing and gambling. She says it would be an unkind thing to tell the boy about the true nature of his father's death and that the secret won't follow them to Hondo's ranch in California. Hondo responds to her emotional plea with an Indian word that seals a squaw-seeking ceremony, ""Varlabania"", which he tells her means ""forever"". The Army leaves to move further on into Apache territory and as promised Hondo refuses to go with them but tells them where Vittorio and his party are.The Army returns after being ambushed by the Apaches, suffering heavy casualties including wounds to Lt. McKay. Vittorio had been killed, causing the Apaches to retreat so they can regroup and select a new chief. Hondo leads the Cavalry and settlers back towards the fort, taking Angie and Johnny with them. The group is attacked by the Apaches, now led by Silva, but the group circles their wagons. They escape the encirclement twice but the Apaches continue their pursuit. Hondo loses his mount and is attacked by Silva, but Honda kills him, retrieving Lt. McKay's uniform shirt from his body. The Indians retreat again to choose a replacement chief.Lt. McKay says the General Crook will be arriving in the territory with a large force to pursue the Apache. Hondo sadly notes the end of the Apache ""way of life."""
tt0045888,"['Horror', 'contentRating', 'GP']","The movie opens with title and credits over the streets of turn of the century New York City at night in the pouring rain. A solitary figure walks down the street holding an umbrella. We enter the Wax Museum with various tableaux of crimes of the past, and then enter the workshop where Prof. Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) is working on a sculpture. His business partner, Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts) enters and walks partially upstairs when he is hailed by Jarrod. He tells Jarrod he's there to study the account books. They have a philosophical difference between their approaches to business. Jarrod proposes a buyout arrangement, and Burke either eager or desperate for the money agrees in principle. A potential investor is scheduled to see Jarrod that very evening.Bruce Allison (Phillip Tonge) and Sidney Wallace (Paul Cavanagh) arrive and are given a brief tour of the wax museum. Wallace is impressed, but Jarrod explains that he's never satisfied with certain aspects of the finished products. Wallace explains he's going to Egypt for three months, so no decision on investment can take place prior to his return. Allison and Wallace depart. Burke was eavesdropping from the upstairs room and heard everything. He is impatient for a financial settlement and proposes an insurance fire. The place is insured for $25,000--$12,500 each. Jarrod is horrified by the proposal, and opposes it categorically. Burke lights the Marie Antoinette wax figure's dress with a match. It starts a fire that Jarrod quickly extinguishes. Burke starts a few more fires, with Jarrod quickly working to save his wax figures. Burke and Jarrod fight, and at one point Jarrod is knocked out. Burke douses the workroom and display area with a flammable liquid and turns on the gas light spigots. He goes upstairs as the place begins to catch fire. He returns to the workroom and continues his fight with the now revived Jarrod. Jarrod works desperately with buckets of water to douse the fire, but it is a losing battle. He is knocked out again by Burke and left in the burning building. The gas ignites blowing out the front of the building. The police and fire departments respond.At a dance Burke is entertaining a young lady, Cathy Gray (Carolyn Jones). He tells Cathy he and Jarrod were friends and no trace of him was found after the fire. He confides to Cathy the insurance settled with a check this morning and he's already cashed it. Burke returns to his office, opens his safe and pulls out the money. Jarrod is there, horribly scarred from the fire wearing all black. He turns off the lights then attacks Burke with a rope. He takes the money, but before he can exit he hears the cleaning lady on the stairs. She continues down the stairs. Jarrod has something dramatic planned. He rigs a rope in the elevator, carries Burke to the elevator door, ties the loose end around Burke's neck and throws the body down the elevator shaft. The cleaning lady (Ruth Warren) screams when she discovers the dead body. It is meant to look like a suicide.At their boarding house Sue Allen (Phyllis Kirk) is helping Cathy get dressed for her evening out. Cathy expresses no sorrow for Burke, as she has found a new sugar daddy. Mrs. Flannigan (Riza Royce) confronts Sue upon her return from a job interview to get her back rent. Sue goes up to her room to get some money from Cathy. Cathy is dead and Jarrod is there in the room. She screams which brings the household upstairs. Sue leaves through an open window out onto the roof. Jarrod chases her down the street. She manages to slip him and calls for help at a house of an old friend. Mrs. Andrews (Angela Clarke) and her son Scott Andrews (Paul Picerni) bring her inside and she tells them Cathy was murdered and she saw the horrible visage of the murderer.The police investigate the murder at the rooming house. Lt. Tom Brennan (Frank Lovejoy) is lead and he is assisted by Sgt. Jim Shane (Dabbs Greer). The coroner (Frank Ferguson) determines Cathy's cause of death was strangulation. The surgeon (Grandon Rhodes) adds that she was drugged. Her body is taken to the morgue storage room where Jarrod is waiting under a sheet pretending to be a corpse. He's there to steal Cathy's body. With two accomplices below, he lowers her body out of a window with rope into a waiting hearse.The next morning, Mrs. Andrews, Scott and Sue come to the police station to give her report. Lt. Brennan tells them Cathy's body was stolen from the morgue. Before that, Mathew Burke's body and a few others were stolen from the morgue. He tells Sue not to leave town, but she is free to leave.Sidney Wallace is back in New York. He stops at a shop and is greeted by Igor (Charles Buchinsky/Bronson), a deaf-mute, and is escorted inside. Jarrod, looking as he did before the fire, greets Wallace sitting in a wheelchair. He tells Wallace he's rebuilding his exhibition from the ground up and will give the public what it wants, ""sensation, horror, shock."" He adds, ""Crimes of violence will be reproduced in wax and exhibited while they are still fresh in the public mind."" He is searching for a model for his new Marie Antoinette. He shows Wallace the basement with the wax body dip machinery. He asks Wallace to invest. He needs $30,000.The House of Wax opens for its debut. A man exits the lobby to work the crowd. The Barker (Reggie Rymal) has two paddle ball games. (Note: This was originally released as a Color 3-D movie.) He works the crowd into a frenzy by knocking things with the balls on the elastic. Jarrod greets Wallace and escorts him into the museum. He gives him the tour, along with some paying customers.Scott Andrews accompanies Sue on a tour of the Wax Museum. Wallace sees and recognizes Scott--he has been sponsoring him as a talented sculptor. Wallace wants to introduce Scott to Jarrod. While Sue wanders around she is surprised to see a Joan of Arc wax figure that looks exactly like her friend Cathy Gray. She climbs up on the tableaux to get a closer look. Jarrod sees this and approaches in his wheelchair. Sue asks, ""But why should it be so like Cathy?"" Jarrod responds, ""I think I can explain that."" He tells her that he copied her face from newspaper clippings. Jarrod offers Scott a job, then tells Wallace he sees Marie Antoinette as Sue.Jarrod, without his makeup, goes to see Sue. He spies on her through her open window. She goes to bed. Jarrod steals into her room, but Sue wakes up and screams. Jarrod departs as Mrs. Andrews comes into her room to comfort her.Sue and Scott are at a Can-Can show having lunch. She is convinced there is something wrong about the Joan of Arc figure. Cathy had one ear pierced as does the wax figure. Such detail seems inconceivable. Scott tells Sue they'll talk to Lt. Brennan. Brennan listens to the story. To humor her, he agrees that the Police will investigate. He does confirm that someone matching Jarrod's description (with makeup) did ask to look at the photographs of Cathy's body. Brennan tells Sgt. Shane to check on Jarrod and his employees. They visit the Museum and examine the Joan of Arc. Sue stops by and climbs up on the wax figure again to touch the face. Jarrod catches her again. Jarrod shows Sue a wax head of herself. He tells her he needs her to model for his Marie Antoinette. Before Brennan and Shane leave, they notice some of the wax figures resemble people who have recently died. Shane also thinks he recognizes one of Jarrod's sculptors, Leon Averill (Nedrick Young).Wallace was waiting outside Brennan's office for Brennan and Shane to return. They arrive and ask him some questions about Jarrod. Before he leaves he vouches for Jarrod. Shane then remembers Leon as an artist imprisoned at Sing-Sing. He was then known as Hendricks and was an alcoholic. Brennan tells Shane to bring him in. They search his belongings at the station and find a watch that belonged to one of the bodies stolen from the morgue. Brennan tells Shane to book him on suspicion of murder.Jarrod sends Scott on an errand after he tells Jarrod Sue will be stopping by later. Sue enters the darkened Museum. Igor locks her in then follows her as she wanders around looking for Scott. She is drawn to the Joan of Arc and climbs back on the tableaux. She pulls back the black wig and finds Cathy's blond hair beneath. Jarrod tells her, ""You shouldn't have done that, my dear."" Sue tells Jarrod, ""It's Cathy's body under the wax. I knew it. I knew it all the time."" Jarrod gets up out of the wheelchair and walks towards her. She runs straight into Igor. She hits Jarrod about the head and his wax face breaks off revealing the scarred face below. She is taken to the basement where Jarrod fires up his wax machine.At police headquarters they are questioning Leon with alcohol as a bribe. He spills his guts and tells the police, ""The whole place is a morgue."" The police race over to the House of Wax. Sue is shackled in a box with the hot wax shower threatening. Scott returns to the museum looking for Sue. Igor blocks the door to the workshop and he and Igor fight. Scott is knocked out. Igor places his body on the guillotine, but before he can operate the machine the police stop him. The police break down the door to the cellar. They fight with Jarrod on the bridge above the boiling vat of wax. Jarrod is knocked into the liquid and dies. Brennan moves the box Sue is shackled into away from the hot wax as the machinery explodes.The next morning Scott, Sue, Brennan and Shane meet in Brennan's office. We close with Brennan holding up the wax head of Igor."

After asking Logan to hear his confession, the distressed Keller proceeds to tell how he killed a lawyer, Vilette, while trying to rob him.Later, Keller tells his wife Alma, who also works at the rectory, that Logan is barred from reporting the crime by the seal of the confessional. The next day, Keller proceeds to the Vilette mansion, where he is employed one day a week as gardener, and after returning the stolen money, alerts the police of Vilette's murder. The troubled Logan also appears at Vilete's, saying that he has an appointment, and is seen whispering to a woman on the street. Later, Inspector Larreau, who is in charge of the investigation, interviews two schoolgirls, who saw a priest leaving Vilette's house between 11:00 and 11:30 p.m. Suspicious of Logan, Larreau asks him to come to the station. Meanwhile, the anxious Keller hides the bloody cassock he wore on the night of the murder in Logan's room.At the station, Larreau questions Logan about his appointment with Vilette and the woman with whom he was seen, but Logan refuses to answer or provide an alibi for the night of the murder. Feeling certain that Logan is the killer, Larreau calls the Crown prosecutor, Willie Robertson, who is socializing with a member of Parliament, Pierre Grandfort and his wife Ruth, unaware that she was the woman outside Vilette's.The next day, Ruth secretly meets Logan on a ferry and tells him to admit to the police that they were together on the night of the murder, but Logan refuses, as he wants to protect her. However, Murphy, one of Larreau's men, sees them together and reports their meeting to Larreau. Reluctantly, Robertson asks Ruth to visit the station. There, with Larreau, Robertson, Pierre and Logan present, Ruth says she is being blackmailed and that she met with Logan on the night of the murder between nine and eleven o'clock to ask his advice. Although both Pierre and Logan try to protect her, Larreau presses for details. Believing the truth will prove Logan's innocence, Ruth tells a story that explains how she and Logan, who had been childhood sweethearts, were also in love as young adults: When war breaks out, Logan, always serious and noble, volunteers for military service and after a while, Ruth no longer hears from him. She eventually marries Pierre, but after the war, meets again with Logan. Without telling him she is married, she spends a day on an island talking to him. When a storm suddenly hits, they miss the last ferry out and take cover in a nearby summer house, where they spend a chaste night together.The next morning, Vilette, the owner of the house, spots them and recognizes Ruth. Afterward, she sees neither Logan nor Vilette. Five years later, Vilette shows up at Logan's ordination and continues to appear to Ruth in unlikely places. Later, Vilette threatens to blackmail her. Fearing scandal for both Pierre and Logan, Ruth meets with Logan to get his advice without telling Pierre. She and Logan plan to meet in front of Vilette's house the following morning, unaware that Vilette has been murdered. Back in the present, Robertson sends Logan and the Grandforts home, as Ruth has provided an alibi for Logan. However, Larreau tells Robertson that the autopsy report has placed Vilette's time of death after 11:30 p.m., which would have given Logan time to kill Vilette after meeting with Ruth, and that Ruth's testimony has suggested a motive for the killing.The next day, Keller taunts Logan about his vows, which require silence, but after seeing the dark look in Logan's eyes, he loads and pockets a gun. When Murphy arrives to see Logan, Keller embroiders a story about how Logan left in distress, which suggests that Logan is evading the police, but then Logan later shows up voluntarily in Larreau's office and is arrested.Meanwhile, the bloody cassock is found in a trunk during a search of Logan's room. Later, at the trial, as Alma watches, Keller testifies that Logan was in great distress on the night of the murder. Then Ruth's story is twisted by the prosecuting Robertson to insinuate an ongoing affair with Logan. In his testimony, Logan still does not reveal what he knows, nor does he implicate Keller when the cassock is shown as evidence.Although the jury acquits Logan for insufficient evidence, both judge and jury publicly express their suspicions. Logan is then free to go, but the disapproving mob almost crushes him. Seeing this, Alma tries to tell a policeman that Logan is innocent, but the panicked Keller kills her. Larreau, Logan and several policemen follow Keller to the Chateau Frontenac, and corner him in the ballroom. Believing that Logan has finally revealed the truth, Keller accuses him of hypocrisy by breaking his vow and thus, incriminates himself. When Logan moves closer to talk, Keller starts to shoot, but the police shoot Keller. As he dies, Keller asks for forgiveness, and Logan absolves him."
tt0045917,"['Horror', 'SciFi']","Psychologically terrifying space-invader movie made at the height of McCarthyism centers around 10-year-old boy astronomer betrayed by most of the adults he knows, including his parents. Small and cheap, but brilliantly and boldly helmed by William Cameron Menzies -- the production designer of Gone With the Wind -- ""Invaders from Mars"" had enough of a timeless paranoiac jolt to be remade, albeit poorly, by Tobe Hooper in the 1980s.
Back in the 50s, while Hollywood and Congress panicked and did some pretty cruel and crazy things in reaction to an alleged invasion of commies, Little Jimmy is figuring out who do you trust after learning that everything he's been told about authority -- family, the church, even the chief of police -- is a big fat lie. Interestingly, the person who defends and leads Jimmy in his insistence on conspiracy is a true alien for the time, a creature who somehow wafted through the cracks in the well-wrought PC system to become a ""lady doctor."" The choice of such an underground avatar is reminiscent of George Romero's use of Duane Jones as the unambivalent protagonist in ""Night of the Living Dead (1968). With Hillary Brooke as mom, and Bert Freed as the top cop.I think it worth pointing out that there are two versions of this film ...one for the American market and one British. As I understand it the films ending was not well recieved by British audiences {a fate shared by the dream season of the TV series Dallas} so some pick ups were quickly reshot to give the film a more hard edged real world conclusion rather then the nightmareish endless loop of the American original.=========================================================================[Note: There are two versions, the familiar American version and a British version that runs about 5 minutes longer. The British version includes a longer exposition between David and Dr. Blake and Kelston at the observatory, and the end of the movie is different. Both versions are presented.]We open with title and credits in red font running over a black star field with planets. A narrator (Arthur Franz) tells us, ""The heavens. Once an object of superstition, awe and fear. Now a vast region for growing knowledge: the distance of Venus, the atmosphere of Mars, the size of Jupiter, and the speed of Mercury. All this and more. We know, but their greatest mystery the heavens have kept a secret. What sort of life, if any, inhabits these other planets? Human life, like ours? Or life extremely lower in scale, or dangerously higher? Seeking the answer to this timeless question, forever seeking, is the constant preoccupation of scientists everywhere. Scientists famous and unknown. Scientists in great universities and in modest homes. Scientists of all ages.""David MacLean (Jimmy Hunt) set his alarm for 4:00 a.m. to see a rare stellar event. The alarm wakes his father, George MacLean (Leif Erickson). He thinks its time to get up for work, which wakes his wife, Mary (Hillary Brooke). She points out the time, but George correctly assumes his son set his own alarm and goes into check on him. David is at the window with a telescope, and apologizes for waking his Dad. Mary breaks up the party, sending her son back to bed. David falls asleep but is awakened by a thunderstorm at 4:40 a.m. He goes to the window and sees a spaceship on the horizon that appears to land behind the house. He wakes his father and reports, ""Dad. Dad. Something landed out beyond the trees in the sand pit. A big, bright light."" Father and son look out David's window but see nothing. They agree to investigate at morning's light. George puts his robe and slippers on and goes outside to investigate, explaining to Mary, that the work at the plant is secret and they have orders to report anything unusual. George walks up the path along a wooden rail fence that ends in a sand pit. We hear an ethereal, eerie choir of voices and see the sand part leaving a hole that grows larger. George disappears behind a tree and the hole in the sand fills back.The next morning, Mary calls for her husband, George. She too walks up the path to the sand field and hears the strange sound that accompanies a disappearance. She returns to the house and calls the police and talks to the two officers that respond to the call. The older policeman, Blaine (an uncredited Charles Cane) and younger, Jackson (an uncredited Douglas Kennedy) listen to the story, then walk out on the sand to investigate. Jackson spots George's flashlight, and Blaine finds a slipper. Jackson falls into the hole, and when Blaine searches for his partner, he too falls into a hole. The hole disappears. While mother and son talk at the window, George walks back into the house and asks, ""Any chance for a cup of coffee?"" George looks a bit disheveled. When questioned, he angrily responds in a tone that is very uncharacteristic, ""I wish you'd please learn to mind your own business."" David asks his father if he saw anything, noticing a scar on the back of his father's neck. When questioned he strikes his son sending him to the floor. The two policemen show up at the house and promise not to report anything. David notices the marks on their necks also. With telescope in hand, David looks at the sand pit and notices a neighborhood girl, Kathy Wilson (Janine Perreau) disappear. Another encounter with his father scares him. He is told, ""I want to warn you. Don't go spreading stories about things you imagined out in those fields. Understand?"" Mary, now dressed, joins her husband for a trip to town. George takes her to the sand pit and her fate.David goes to the Wilson home to report Kathy's disappearance. Mrs. Wilson (an uncredited Fay Baker) is incredulous at David's story. Her concern changes from fear to anger when Kathy appears at the door behind David holding a bouquet of flowers. She chastises David for such a cruel hoax. David notices smoke coming from the Wilson basement. A neighbor helps with a hose, but concedes the fire is spreading too rapidly to control. When asked if she was playing in the basement, Kathy lies and denies any involvement, but smiles slyly. David runs to the general store to phone Prof. Kelston at the observatory, but his secretary (an uncredited Barbara Billingsley) tells him Kelston is out and won't be back until later in the afternoon. He stops at a gas station to tell his story to the station attendant, Jim (an uncredited Todd Karns). Jim makes a phone call, but David runs to the local police station and demands to see the Chief. The police desk Sgt. Finlay (an uncredited Walter Sande) listens to David's story as the Police Chief listens from his doorway. Chief Barrows (an uncredited Bert Freed) invites David into his office to talk alone. When Barrows turns to call David's father, David sees the ""X"" shaped scar on Barrow's neck. David tries to flee but literally runs into Finlay who stops him and takes him to a detention cell for holding. Barrows goes out to find David's father, while Finlay decides to call Dr. Pat Blake (Helena Carter). She visits David in his cell. David confides his story after checking her neck for the tell-tale scar. She departs David's cell and asks about the police report on David's father. When told there was none, she asks to use the Chief's phone to call Dr. Stuart Kelston (Arthur Franz). Mary comes to collect her son. Kelston vouches for David as honest and level headed. Mary takes David to the door of the police station where George is waiting. Before the parents can spirit David away, Dr. Blake orders the boy held and she tells the MacLeans that David may have polio. The parents leave, and Pat takes David into her custody. Pat and David visit Kelston at the Observatory (Griffith Park Observatory, Los Angeles, California). They speculate on which planet is the most likely to be inhabited. Selecting Mars, Kelston observes that their cities may be underground or they live on space ships.[British Version (About 7 minutes of footage): After they get up from Kelston's desk, he and David explain to Pat where the spaceship could have come from and how. Once Mars is chosen as a likely candidate, David explains to Pat that Mars has oxygen in its atmosphere and water vapor. Kelston concludes, ""That some form of life exists on Mars."" He adds, ""Its the firm belief of many scientists that the Earth has been under systematic and close range observation for more than 200 years."" They review UFO sightings and the various newspaper clippings on sightings. Kelston then pulls out various models of UFO types. Kelston pulls a green, saucer shaped model from the cabinet and David exclaims, ""That's it! That's exactly what I saw Dr. Kelston. Same shape, color, even the bubble."" Kelston volunteers, ""Our research radar has plotted a ship like this twice in the past six weeks.""]They walk up to the telescope to looks at the rocket project and the sand pit. They further speculate that the Martians are here to sabotage the project to protect themselves from us. They witness George MacLean push General Mayberry (an uncredited William Forrest) into the hole. Kelston calls Col. Fielding to report what he saw. Col. Fielding (Morris Ankrum) and his aide, Sgt. Rinaldi (Max Wagner) take the call and jump into action. They call Washington and get orders from the Pentagon Chief of Staff (an uncredited Frank Wilcox) to take charge at the arms plants being threatened. The police have been ordered to arrest those suspected of mind control by the Martians. Tanks and other armament are delivered to the area. David tells his story to Col. Fielding. They talk to the neighbor, Mr. Turner (an uncredited John Eldredge). Pat asks about Kathy's cause of death and is told cerebral hemorrhage. She goes to the hospital for the autopsy.On the roof of the MacLean house, David shows Col. Fielding where everyone disappears. This piques Rinaldi's curiosity and he steals away to investigate on his own. An army unit arrives and Maj. Clary (an uncredited Gil Herman) and Capt. Roth (Milburn Stone) are briefed by the Colonel. Rinaldi is captured by the Martians, but not without a fight. Search lights are placed around the sand pit. Pat returns from the hospital and brings them a crystal and platinum device that was in Kathy's neck. Roth speculates it can be used to track the Martians. Tank battalions arrive and are deployed around the sand pit area. Col. Fielding receives a phone call informing him that the Armstead Plant was destroyed. The two police officers, Blaine and Jackson are surrounded by plant security, but before they can be taken into custody, both collapse and die, the explosive component in the control device in their necks activated by the Martians. At the Rocket facility, Police Chief Barrows and General Mayberry are confronted by the Military Police. They try to escape but are blown up by nitroglycerine they were carrying. Dr. Bill Wilson (an uncredited Robert Shayne) is working late in the lab, mourning the death of his daughter Kathy. Outside the gate, the MacLeans are planning an assassination. While Mary pretends to have car trouble, the guard is distracted long enough for George to knock him out, gain access to the facility and attempt to shoot Dr. Wilson working in his lab. The attempt fails and they are chased by the Military Police. They lose control of their speeding car and crash. They are taken into custody and transferred to the hospital for surgery to remove their implanted devices.The demolitions unit of the army has blown a hole through the sand into a chamber below. Col. Fielding is first in the hole. They conclude that this chamber is no longer active and has been sealed off from the rest of the tunnel system. They retreat back to the surface, where Capt. Roth has completed his detection device to locate the Martians. He starts his search. A call for Dr. Blake informs her that David's parents are in the hospital and ready for surgery. She takes David for a walk to inform him of his parents. As they talk they hear the eerie choir of voices sound that always presages the abduction of humans by the Martians. The pair fall into the hole. Kelston sees this and alerts Roth and Fielding. Towering over the dazed pair are huge, green clad mutants. Two body guard mutants carry the Martian Intelligence (an uncredited Luce Potter) and place it on a pedestal. The Intelligence is encased in a clear glass sphere. It has an oversized skull, human looking face, but the body is just a partial chest with branching, fork-like appendages that move like octopus arms. David and Pat are carried back to the Martian ship through the tunnels the Martian mutants created with an Infrared Ray gun that melts and fuses rock with ease. On the surface, Roth explains, ""There's nothing here Colonel. They've already gone."" Inside the ship David and Pat are presented to the Intelligence. Roth has located the source of the signal and a charge is set to gain access to the tunnel outside the ship. Sgt. Rinaldi, under mind-control, questions the pair. A mutant places Dr. Blake on the table that installs the mind control device. She is rendered unconscious by a light ray, then turned over exposing her neck. Rinaldi carries David back into the tunnels as the troops invade the ship. David cries for help allowing Fielding to track him in the tunnels. The Intelligence marshals his mutant force to attack the human troops. Dr. Kelston rescues Pat from the operating table just before the mind control device is inserted. The Martian ship activates for departure. Demolition charges are installed and set for six minutes. The troops exit the ship and destroy the tunnel leading to the ship's entrance. Unfortunately, their exit to the surface has been blocked and they can't go back and delay or defuse the bomb on the Martian ship. The troops rescue David and take Rinaldi captive. David assists the troops on using the IR Tunnel Gun to get back through the chamber to the exit to the surface.Back on the surface they run for safety. The ship pushes its way to the surface as the bomb ticks down to the final seconds until detonation. As David runs to safety a montage of earlier scenes flashes before us. The bomb goes off destroying the ship as David wakes in his bed from the sound of thunder in the distance. He runs to his parent's room. They are there, perfectly normal and he is told it was all just a nightmare. He is put back to bed, but again sees the Martian ship crash land in the sand pit. We close with the star field and closing theme.[British Version: We see everyone running from the sand pit area. Kelston and Pat Blake take shelter behind a tank. David runs towards them, falls, and is helped to his feet by Kelston and Blake. They embrace and watch as the Martian ship gets airborne. It blows up and the flash of light is shown on the three still huddled behind the tank. The subsequent blast wave knocks down a tree behind them. Pat reassures David, ""With the control point destroyed, nothing can possibly happen to your mother and father now. They are going to be all right."" Acting as surrogate parents, they bid David good night from his bedroom door. ""The little man has had a busy day,"" remarks Pat as David sleeps. We close with a flash of lightening over the sand pit, then the star field and closing theme.]"

tt0045920,"['Horror', 'SciFi']","A fireball streaks across the desert sky and crashes. We see an aerial view of Sand Rock, Arizona in the late evening in the early spring. Inside an isolated ranch house outside of town we meet John Putnam (Richard Carlson) and his girlfriend Ellen Fields (Barbara Rush). He is an amateur astronomer, she the local school teacher. They sit in front of a fire in his partially completed home enjoying a cup of coffee. They walk outside to take in the night air when they spot the ""meteor"" from the opening shot.From inside the crater, by the old Excelsior Mine, we see a sphere partially exposed that looks like a soccer ball. A hexagonal shaped ""door"" opens and we see some weird machinery and in shadow one of the occupants--a single eyed blob of a creature. It exits the ship and explores the desert leaving in its wake a shimmery trail.John and Ellen charter Pete Davis (Dave Willock) to take them to the crater in his helicopter. They circle the crater and land near the rim. The three climb to the top and peer inside. John walks down to the floor of the newly formed crater insisting that Ellen and Pete stay up on the rim. John sees the ship partially buried in the side of the mine, and also notices the shimmery substance near the exit of the ship. He stretches his hand out to touch the glowing material, but hesitates when he notices something inside the ship and stands up to face it. The door closes and slams shut triggering an avalanche of loose debris, burying the ship and almost killing John. John climbs back out of the crater and explains what he saw, but Ellen and Pete do not believe him.Two cars approach the crater. Pete and Ellen beg John not to discuss what he saw--they think he was imagining it. Sheriff Matt Warren (Charles Drake) and Dave Loring (Alan Dexter), who runs the local newspaper, arrive on the scene. John starts to relay his story and the disbelief and ridicule starts. Three more cars arrive at the crater. John, Ellen, and Pete fly back to the airport. John and Ellen drive back to his house. Along the way they are being observed. They encounter the creature on the highway as it appears to block their path on the road. John pulls to the side of the road thinking they hit it. Finding nothing they continue down the road.The next morning the crater is a buzz of activity. A KLTV television news van pulls up. The Sheriff's office has set up a cordon around the crater admitting only authorized personnel. The military has sent a small group out to explore. John and Ellen arrive only to be hounded by the press. John is there to meet with Dr. Snell. Dugan (Robert Carson) from American Press, and Lober (Dick Pinner) from Press Dispatch want to question John about the Sand Rock Star newspaper headline, ""Star Gazer Sees Martians"". They get no answers and turn their attention to Ellen, who is equally reluctant to talk to the press. John walks down into the crater to talk to Dr. Snell (George Eldredge). His assistant, Bob (Bradford Jackson) is taking radioactivity measurements, but finds none. Snell is convinced it was just a meteor, and refuses Johns request to dig it out. As John heads back to his car, where Ellen was patiently waiting, he is confronted by Matt. He has known Ellen a long time and is concerned about her involvement with John. He is jealous. John and Ellen drive off.As they are driving the see the county telephone linemen, George (Russell Johnson), and his boss, Frank (Joe Sawyer). John asks them if they've seen anything. Frank tells them he's hearing something very strange on the wires. Frank and George head down the road and encounter the creature. As he exits the truck, George is attacked and ""globbed"" or absorbed. John and Ellen suspect something is wrong and turn around and head back in the same direction that George and Frank took. They find the empty telephone truck on the side of the road. John retrieves his gun from the car and they begin their search, starting with the truck. John notices blood on the truck door and the shimmery trail, a telltale sign of the xenomorph. George appears to them, but is behaving very strangely. John notices Frank's arm on the ground, unmoving, the rest of his body is hidden behind a boulder. John and Ellen head back to town to get the Sheriff. John states his conclusion that Frank is dead, and it appears that George was the perpetrator. The xenomorph, now masquerading as George explains things to the human George and Frank.The Sheriff reluctantly agrees to accompany John and Ellen back out to where they encountered George and Frank, but when they arrive the truck and any evidence is gone. The three drive back to town. The Sheriff returns to his office, but John notices George and Frank walking through town. John follows and confronts them. They warn John not to interfere.Back at the Excelsior Mine, miners Sam (Edgar Dearing) and Toby (Warren MacGregor) are building a fire just outside the mine opening. They are waiting for Tom (George Selk) to return with food. Tom and his mule are just about back to the mine when the mule is spooked, and runs off. Tom turns around and is confronted by the xenomorph and is ""globbed"" or absorbed. Sam and Toby think they hear something in the mine and enter it. As they exit the mine they are met by the creature and are also a globbed.John and Ellen are summoned to see the Sheriff that evening. Frank's wife (Virginia Mullen) and George's girlfriend Jane Dean (Kathleen Hughes) have reported them acting strangely and now missing. Their clothes are also missing. The sheriff questions John because he appears to be the last one to have spoken to either of them. Ellen takes Mrs. Daylon and Jane home in John's car. John stays with Matt to discuss the situation; he tells Matt that Frank and George are in fact the creatures from the space craft stuck in the crater. The sheriff tells John that electrical equipment has been stolen from the hardware store and that Dr. Snell and his assistant, Bob, have been reported missing. John and Matt go out to the crater and find Dr. Snell's car, but no trace of Snell or Bob.Ellen is driving alone on the highway when she encounters Frank standing in the middle of the highway. She stops and he gets into the car. Frank instructs Ellen to take him to the mine. Back at the Sheriff's office, the phone rings. It is for John, and he is informed that the xenomorphs have Ellen. The Sheriff and John drive out into the desert. John exits the car and searches for Ellen. He sees what appears to be Ellen on a ridgeline in a cocktail dress. He follows her. She leads him to the opening to the mine shaft. A voice from inside the mine tells John that they are repairing their ship and will be leaving that night. The missing townsfolk are being held hostage. John begs to see the creature as it really is. It shows itself and John is horrified and repelled. He returns to see Matt who has been waiting by the car. Matt drops John off at his house. John notices the door unlocked and a shimmering trail leading back to an empty closed. All of his clothes are missing.The Sheriff gives orders to clear everyone away from the crater. John tells Matt that he got a visit and his clothes are missing. Frank appears in town just outside the Sheriff's office. Matt is spoiling for a confrontation with the creature impersonating the lineman, but John restrains him. They fight. Frank drives off in his telephone truck. The Sheriff forms an impromptu posse as John steals his police car and heads off to the crater. The Sheriff intends to confront Frank on the highway. Taking a shortcut through the desert, he forms a vehicle barricade across the highway. As Frank approaches, the posse opens fire. The truck careens off the highway and hits a boulder and bursts into flame. Meanwhile John arrives at the mine entrance and enters. He finds alien Ellen. She tells John they only need a few more hours. She then attacks him with a wand that emits a beam that cuts through rock, but misses. He shoots her with his gun and she falls into a lake below and dissolves. The posse arrives outside as John continues his exploration of the old mine. He hears machinery and finds the aliens in their human form making repairs to their ship. The head xenomorph has assumed John's identity. He explains their mission and the equipment's power. John demands Ellen's release as a sign of good faith. Alien John reciprocates by ordering all the hostages released. As they depart the mine, alien John resumes his alien form. John seals the mine entrance with dynamite to keep the posse away from the aliens. The ground begins to rumble and the ship departs, streaking across the sky."

The family is towing a small trailer with camping gear so they can fish and camp on the isolated beach south of Escondido in Mexico.As they leave drive, they get farther away from towns, services, and civilizations. When they need water for the cars radiator, they can only find a deserted service station. They leave the main road and encounter a police block. After a quick scan of the car, the Mexican authorities let them proceed, with no explanation for why they were stopped. When Helen asks Doug why he didn't push for an explanation, he tells her he didn't want them to look too closely at the car. He didn't want to explain why he was carrying his army pistol. Helen puts the gun in the glove box and they proceed.When they arrive at the beach, it is indeed isolated. An old, rotting jetty emerges far out into the water. As Doug and Helen are getting settled in and relaxing, Bobby climbs out to the jetty's end. Helen is worried the jetty is not safe and frantically calls Bobby back. As he return, his foot slips and is caught between two planks. Doug goes out to free him. As they are walking back over the precarious timbers, a large wave combined with Doug's weight causes the jetty to fall. Doug is trapped on the beach, his foot stuck under a timber too large to move.Helen tries to dig Doug out with a shovel, but the beach is solid rock. She retrieves the car jack and nearly has the large timber raised when the pin in the jack breaks. Doug and Helen decide that with a sturdy rope, she can pull the timber with the car. Helen will have to drive back to the deserted service station to find a rope. They estimate that Helen should have four hours before the rising tide covers Doug completely, threatening to drown him.

Hans Muller (Kirk Douglas), a German Jew, was once a well-known juggler before he was committed to a concentration camp; Muller survived, but his wife and children did not. After the war, Muller and many other displaced people found themselves in a temporary camp in Israel; his experiences have left him upset and confused, and several of the guards notice that he's behaving oddly. Muller flees the camp after one day, but while running away, he's stopped by Kogan (Richard Benedict), an Israeli policeman. When Kogan asks to see Muller's papers, he immediately flashes back to an unsetting memory in which a Nazi officer asked the same question; Muller panics, attacks the cop, and flees for Mount Carmel. In the morning, Muller encounters a group of children who believe the story he tells them: that he's a tourist from the United States. One of them, Yehoshua (Joseph Walsh), is making his way to a kibbutz in Syria, and Muller, who hopes to get to some friends in Egypt, joins him. Muller entertains the young man by teaching him to juggle, and they become close friends. When Yehoshua is injured by a land mine, Muller rushes him to a hospital, where he meets Ya'el (Milly Vitale), a woman who lost her husband to Arabs. A romance soon blossoms between Muller and Ya'el, and he confesses to her that he's on the run from the police; meanwhile, Israeli Detective Karni (Paul Stewart) is combing the nation, searching for the juggler -- not to arrest him, but to convince him that he's not wanted for murder, and that others want to help him.

George, who is fed up with the stories that have made his children less practical, angrily declares that Wendy has gotten too old to continue staying in the nursery with them. That night, they are visited in the nursery by Peter Pan himself, who teaches them to fly with the help of his pixie friend, Tinker Bell, and takes them with him to the island of Never Land.A ship of pirates is anchored off Never Land, commanded by Captain Hook with his sidekick, Mr. Smee. Hook boldly plots to take revenge upon Peter Pan for cutting off his hand, but trembles at the presence of a crocodile, which consumed Hook's hand and is eager to taste the rest of him. The crew's restlessness is interrupted by the arrival of Peter and the Darlings.

tt0046268,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","1950, in the very isolated town of Las Piedras, in Southern Mexico. Surrounded by the desert, the town is very poor, and also very quiet in the very hot midday sun. Located in the only street of the town, the bar ¬´Corsario¬ª is the meeting place for all the European who, for various reasons, found their way here and can't get away from the town. Seated on chairs, but not drinking because they have no money, Frenchmen Mario (Yves Montand), German Smerloff (Jo Dest), American Dick and Italian Bernardo (Luis de Lima) are looking at the very few people walking in the street. The owner of the ¬´Corsario¬ª, Hernandez (Dario Moreno), eventually kicks them out of his bar.Mario is mildly in love with Linda (V√©ra Clouzot), the waitress of the bar, who is also having sex with Hernandez. Another european, Bimba (Peter van Eyck), a Dutchman, is doing some menial work for Hernandez, like collecting the mail from the daily plane, the only link of Las Piedras with the outside world. Bernardo sneaks into Bimba's van, because he is always trying to find a pilot who would take him to the USA, a country for which he is holding a valid visa.A very elegant Frenchman, Jo (Charles Vanel) is among the passengers leaving the plane. Actually he is another european running away from something. He discreetly gives a few dollars to the immigration officer, who lets him walk out of the airport without a visa. He takes a taxi to the town, where he meets Mario. The two exiled compatriots immediately make friends with each other. We learn that Jo is from Paris, and Mario from Corsica. Jo explains to Mario that he gave his last dollars to the immigration officer, and Mario takes him to the ¬´Corsario¬ª, where Hernandez, because of Jo's elegant outfit, thinks he is rich and pays for his taxi. Jo discreetly explains to Mario that he had to leave Paris very quickly, and didn't even had time to pack a suitcase.Mario leaves Jo in the ¬´Corsario¬ª to go to the small apartment he shares with Luigi (Folco Lulli), and eat the lunch Luigi has been fixing for both of them. Luigi is an Italian, who, unlike the other european expatriates, has a job¬†: he works as a mason.Then Mario goes back to the ¬´Corsario¬ª, to share a Cognac with Jo. All the other european expatriates seem to be jealous of Mario's new friend. Jo, who doesn't like music, shut off the radio, but Smerloff switch it back on. Jo asks Hernandez to switch it off. Feeling offended, the expatriates leave the bar, making Hernandez very happy.When they are gone, Mario tells Jo how difficult it is to get a job in this poor isolated town. The plane being the only way to leave the town, and the plane being very expensive, the expatriates have no alternative than to stay and wait. There is little opportunity for employment aside from the American corporation that dominates the town, Southern Oil Company (SOC), which operates the nearby oil fields and owns a walled compound within the town. SOC is suspected of unethical practices such as exploiting local workers and taking the law into its own hands, but the townspeople's dependence upon it is such that they suffer in silence.But Jo knows the man in charge of SOC in Las Piedras, Bill O'Brien (William Tubbs). They have being doing some not very legal stuff together a long time ago. And Jo goes to see him in his office. But O'Brien can't do a thing for his old pal without risking to loose his own job, because the Big Bosses of SOC would certainly get to know what Jo and Bill had done together in the past.Within the following days, Jo and Mario become very close, which gets Luigi a bit jealous. And he is not the only one to be jealous. Linda also feels that Mario neglects her for Jo. But Luigi gets real mad when Mario gives Jo one of Luigi's white trousers, after Jo's trousers got ruined by mud. Mario decides not to live anymore with Luigi, but, before leaving, he takes with him his most precious possession, the last subway ticket he used when he left Paris.In the evening, Luigi walks in the ¬´Corsario¬ª wearing his best suit, and sits at the expatriates' table, ignoring the other table, where Jo and Mario are sitting alone. He orders Champagne, and asks Linda to dance with him. Jo tears the cord off the radio to stop the music, but Luigi keeps on dancing and clapping his hands, imitated by all the other expatriates, except, of course, Jo and Mario. Jo takes the bottle of Champagne, shakes it violently, and then uncorks it and sprays the Champagne on Luigi and his friends. Luigi wants to hit Jo with the empty bottle, but Jo points a gun at him. Then, to push him to his limit, Jo gives him the gun and slaps his face, but Luigi just drops the gun and leaves the bar.A massive fire erupts at one of the SOC oil fields. O'Brien knows that the only way to extinguish the flames is to cut the fire at its base with an explosion caused by nitroglycerine. But the 200 gallons stock of nitroglycerine is at La Piedras, and not at the oil field. With such a short notice and the lack of proper equipment, the explosive must be transported inside regulars jerry cans on the two best trucks available at the SOC headquarters and then driven 300 miles away. Due to the poor condition of the roads and the highly volatile nature of nitroglycerine, the job is considered too dangerous for the unionized SOC employees. So O'Brien is going to ask some of the european expatriates of Las Piedras to drive the trucks. But, against the cynical advice of one of his assistants, he is going to give each driver $2000 to drive the trucks ($2000 in 1950 would be almost $20000 in 2015).All the expatriates pass a driving test. Even Luigi, who just learned that his lungs are full of cement, and that he has to stop working as a mason or he will die very soon. The first one to pass the test is Bernardo. He is driving a small truck with O'Brien sitting next to him and all the other men gathered at the back of the truck. One of the men throws his jacket on the windshield and Bernardo, frightened, slams on the breaks. Only four men get the job : Bimba, Luigi, Mario and Smerloff. All the men leave O'Brien's office except Jo, who is a bit mad not to have been picked up by his old ¬´friend¬ª. O'Brien tells him that Jo is like him : a bit too old for that kind of job, but he also tells him that if one of the drivers desists at the last minute, he will get the job.Hernandez offers a drink to the drivers. Bernardo trusts a letter for his mother to Linda for her to mail it the next morning, and then he goes out the bar and hangs himself on a tree in the garden.At 3:00 am next morning, Mario, Bimba and Luigi are gathered in O'Brien's office, waiting for Smerloff. Jo walks in to say good-bye to Mario, and looks genuinely surprised about Smerloff's absence. Luigi points out he was the last one who was seen with Smerloff going out of the ¬´Corsario¬ª. O'Brien, who knows Jo very well, understands that Smerloff has been killed by Jo, and, a bit reluctantly, gives him the driving job.Jo and Mario take the bigger truck and leave first, the second truck leaving half an hour later for safety reason. But, before leaving, Jo checks meticulously his truck, to O'Brien's annoyance. Eventually Jo climbs in the truck and Mario gives him his lucky subway ticket. Then Jo starts the truck and slowly leaves the SOC yard. They cross Las Piedras still asleep, except for Linda who climbs on the truck footboard to say good-bye to Mario, who kicks her away from the truck. Jo doesn't feel very good and thinks that his malaria may be coming back, but he doesn't want Mario to drive.After only 17 kilometers (10,5 miles) of very slow driving, Jo decides to stop the truck and eat something, but Mario sees the other truck already coming behind them and tells Jo they must leave at once. Jo starts driving again but he feels worse and worse and even vomits the coffee Mario gave him. They stop the truck and the other truck joins them. Luigi has some very harsh words for Jo, and then decides it's better for him and Bimba to take the lead.Luigi and Bimba reach what is called ¬´the washboard¬ª. Outside the forest, where there are no trees to protect the road, the surface of the road has been wrinkled by the wind. For the trucks not to bounce on the road, they have to drive at forty miles an hour minimum or at less than six miles an hour, the best solution being of course to drive at forty.While Luigi is keeping the speed above forty, the engine starts having problems, and they have to use a length of concrete near a pipe-line pump to stop the truck. They find that the problem with the engine is due to some gas-oil having been added to the regular gasoline normally used by this type of truck. They put some fresh pure gasoline in the tank, but they realize that the length of concrete is too short to bring the truck to forty mph, so they have to drive the rest of the ¬´washboard¬ª at very slow speed. Before leaving, Luigi puts his large white handkerchief on the concrete for Mario and Jo to see it as a warning signal for danger. But, as soon as they are gone, a local kid steals the handkerchief.Meanwhile, Jo is falling apart because of his fear, and he can't bring the truck to forty mph, so Mario decides to drive. He crosses the length of concrete at forty mph, while the kid waves to them with the stolen handkerchief. As they come near the end of the ¬´washboard¬ª section, they see the headlights of the other truck in the distance. But Luigi's truck can't go above seven mph and Mario's truck can't go under 40 mph, or both trucks start vibrating. But fortunately, at the last seconds, Luigi's truck reaches the end of the washboard and can speed up.Luigi's truck starts climbing a mountain with many hairpin turns. One of them is so tight that they have to maneuver the truck and use a wooden platform built near the road. But the wood is partly rotten, and the truck almost breaks through the platform. They eventually succeed their maneuver and resume their journey on the road.When Jo sees the rotten platform, he wants to give up, but Mario gets real mad at him and forces him to help him and guide him while he maneuvers the truck. But Jo runs away in the mountain, and Mario has to do the whole maneuver by himself. When he eventually drives back on the road, the rotten platform collapses behind him. He starts driving away, without Jo, who runs after him on the road. Mario eventually takes Jo back on board, but he is very mad at him, and tells him very precisely what he thinks about him and his cowardice.A huge boulder, which fell from the mountain, blocks the road. Bimba asks Luigi to dig a hole, about 30 inches deep, in the boulder, while he's going to siphon about one liter of nitroglycerine out of a can, and into a Thermos bottle. Mario and Jo join them, and Bimba asks them to move both trucks as far as possible from the boulder. Then they all hide behind rocks far away from the boulder, except Bimba. Very slowly, he pours the explosive into the hole in the boulder. Then he ties a hammer above the hole with a long wick. With his cigarette, he lights the end of the wick and runs to hide behind a rock. The boulder explodes. Bimba, Luigi and Mario congratulate each other and, to celebrate, they go and take a piss together, not even saying a word to Jo, who pisses alone.Luigi is driving his truck, while Bimba is shaving and telling Luigi about his father being murdered by the Nazis, and himself being forced to work for three years in a salt mine. Meanwhile, Jo, who calmed down a bit, is rolling a cigarette for Mario, when they see an explosion further away on the road. They immediately understand it's Luigi and Bimba's truck. Jo runs out of the truck, but Mario catches him back, hits him very hard and brings him back to the truck.Mario and Jo arrive at the scene of the explosion only to find a large crater rapidly filling with oil from a pipeline ruptured in the blast. Jo walks in front of the truck to help Mario navigate through the oil-filled crater. The truck, however, is in danger of becoming bogged down and during his frantic attempts to prevent it from getting stuck, Mario runs over Jo. Although Mario ultimately succeeds in getting the truck out of the the muck, Jo is mortally wounded. He dies just before they reach the burning oil field. On his arrival at the oil field, Mario is hailed as a hero, but he collapses from exhaustion when he gets out of the truck.Upon his recovery, Mario heads home in the same truck, now empty. The SOC gives him double wages, his and Jo's. Mario jubilantly drives down the mountain road, while a party is being held at the ¬´Corsario¬ª, where Mario's friends eagerly await his arrival. The radio plays Johann Strauss' ¬´The Blue Danube¬ª, both at the ¬´Corsario¬ª and in Mario's truck. Linda dances with Mario's friends and Mario dances recklessly with his truck. He takes one corner too fast and plunges through the guardrail to his death, holding his lucky subway ticket in his hand. At the same moment, Linda, as if she knew what just happened, suddenly faints in the arms of the man she was dancing with."

tt0046359,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'War']","Captured Americans coping with life in a German POW camp in World War II are puzzled by the simplicity with which the Germans are able to stave off escape attempts, shooting those who try. Sefton () is a POW who has profitably wagered with his fellow American prisoners that these escapes would fail.The POWs fear there may be an informer in their midst, but who is it? As it becomes clearer and clearer to his fellow inmates that Sefton has considerable contact with his German captors, his fellow POWs mistakenly conclude that he is the informer and they turn on him, including physically beating him and helping themselves to some of his belongings.Sefton understands in full that to clear his name, he must determine the identity of the real informer, and he is, eventually, able to work out that Price (), whose English is impeccable, is a German informant masquerading as an American POW. Written messages, Sefton discovers, are being smuggled by Price to the Germans through a hollow chess piece on the chessboard in the barracks, with phony air raid drills staged to enable the Germans to retrieve these messages undetected.Now realizing that Price has figured prominently in the death of the Americans that have attempted escape, Sefton plots revenge, and, after exposing Price's true identity to his fellow POWs, he maneuvers to force Price to make an unauthorized exit from the barracks. To the guards manning the tower, Price's exit looks like an American escape attempt, and they shoot him, much to the dismay of Stalag Commandant Von Scherbach ().The diversion created by the shooting incident gives Sefton a chance to escape, and he takes with him a brave lieutenant () who has recently been captured. Because of the measures of success against the Germans he had gained prior to his capture, the lieutenant is a marked man, but he and Sefton are successful in their escape attempt.The elimination of the German informer and the first successful escape by American POWs lift the spirits of the other POWs.================================A few days before Christmas, 1944, at the German prisoner-of-war camp, Stalag 17, two American POWs, Manfredi and Johnson, inmates of Barracks 4, are preparing an escape. The story's narrator, Cookie, one of the prisoners, suggests that there may be a traitor among the men of Barracks 4.The men have secretly been digging a tunnel from their latrine to a point just beyond the barbed-wire fence that marks the perimeter of the camp. After going over their plan to sneak into Switzerland, Manfredi and Johnson get out of the barracks through a trap door hidden under the wood-burning stove and sneak into the latrine. They crawl through the tunnel and begin digging to the surface beyond the barbed wire fence.Inside the barracks, the men speculate as to how long it will take their comrades to emerge beyond the fence. They begin to predict that the escapees will make it all the way when one of them, a shrewd man named Sefton, wagers two packs of cigarettes that the men won't even make it out of the nearby forest. The other men, most of whom dislike Sefton, wager against him.Outside, Manfredi and Johnson dig to the surface and are about leave when they are spotted by a small German squad outside the fence, who open fire, killing them both. Inside the barracks, the remaining prisoners, including Sefton, are disheartened, knowing their buddies could not possibly have escaped. The hot-headed Duke demands an explanation from the barracks' security officer, Price. Price says he doesn't have an answer. Meanwhile, Sefton and Cookie quietly gather up the cigarettes that Sefton has won in the bet and store them in a footlocker Sefton keeps under his bed.The next morning the entire camp is awakened for roll call. Barracks 4 is overseen by Sergeant Schultz, a jolly man whom the men have absolutely no trust for. In the camp's muster grounds, the men are addressed by the camp commandant, Oberst von Scherbach. Scherbach tells the men that his guards successfully prevented the escape from night before and that no man has ever escaped from his camp alive. He also has the corpses of Manfredi and Johnson lying in the mud and uncovered for all the men to see. The Barracks 4 chief, Hoffy, protests the treatment of the bodies and demands they have a proper burial. Von Scherbach agrees to do so. Von Scherbach goes on, saying that being caught outside the barracks after lights out means summary execution. Also, the stove in Barracks 4 will be removed so it cannot be used to camouflage the trap door the men cut in the floor and the men will also dig up the tunnel they dug and fill it in.Von Scherbach also announces that each barracks will be given a small Christmas tree and that all the prisoners will go through delousing. One of the prisoners, the shellshocked Joey, begins to play his ocarina, which is gently taken away by another prisoner, Stanislaus ""Animal"" Kazawa (Animal makes Joey another one later as a Christmas present). While the commandant talks and uses a mocking tone, Animal throws the ocarina at the water in front of the commandant, splashing his highly polished boots with mud. The Commandant demands the guilty man step forward. Animal does and is followed moments later by several other men. Eventually, the entire prisoner population steps forward, covering for Animal. The Commandant, temporarily flustered, cancels the Christmas trees and tells the men they'll be deloused with cold water from the camp's fire hoses. The men are dismissed.After the men have the opportunity to clean up in their latrines, and following a small incident where Animal is nearly shot for crossing the barbed-wire of the camp while lusting after Russian female prisoners, the men go back to their barracks for breakfast. Sefton fries himself an egg in front of the other prisoners and when questioned about how he paid for it, he tells them that he bartered for it using the cigarettes he'd won the night before. The other men are quite angry that Sefton would use cigarettes he'd gotten as a result of the deaths of their comrades, however, Sefton counters, saying that many other prisoners trade with the Germans and that life in the camp is such that thievery is common. One of the other prisoners, the short-tempered Duke, tells Sefton that collusion with the Germans could get him hurt or killed and small fight breaks out. Hoffy promptly breaks it up and Sefton, claiming he has indigestion, gives the fried egg to Joey. Price, the barracks security officer, asks Sefton how he could be so sure that Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't make it to freedom. Sefton says he didn't know for sure but he ""liked the odds"" of the situation. Sefton also angrily tells his comrades that they're wasting their time and risking their lives unnecessarily by trying to escape. Sefton plans to ride out the war as a prisoner and stay alive.The barracks of the camp share a ham radio that they keep hidden and use to listen to the BBC and other communications about the war. The radio is smuggled throughout the compound by Marko and his partner, Steve, who is on crutches having lost a leg in combat. They use his empty pantleg to hide various items, including the radio. When the radio is brought to Hoffy and Barracks 4, Marko tells them they can have it only for two days instead of a week; the traitor in their barracks is known to the rest of the camp and the other barracks chiefs fear the radio will be discovered. The men set up the radio immediately, using a few yards of chicken wire as the antenna, which doubles as their volleyball net. One of the prisoners, Blondie, is a radio expert and begins to report about military actions in Europe; the news he picks up is about the famous Battle of the Bulge. Just then, Schultz arrives to seize the barracks stove and the radio is cleverly hidden in a pail of water. Hoffy and Duke try to grill Schultz about the barracks spy but Schultz refuses to tell them anything. Schultz also notices that a signal from the spy has been left for him; a loop has been tied in the cord for one of the bare light bulbs hanging from the rafters. After he barks orders for the men to report outside to fill in the escape tunnel, he goes to the chess board and takes the black queen. Pulling off the crown, he sees a small note rolled up and hidden inside. He exchanges the queen for an identical piece, pulls the loop out of the cord and walks out.While the men uncover the escape tunnel they dug, they notice a horse-drawn cart going by with the coffins of Manfredi and Johnson. The men all remove their hats in respect. Cookie narrates for a while about Sefton himself who, despite the poor conditions of the camp, has built a substantial entrepreneurship for himself based mostly on the trading of cigarettes. Sefton has several successful businesses at his disposal including distilling schnapps from potato peels, horse races (he uses mice that run around a small track), and a telescope that the men use to peek into the delousing shack in the Russian compound where female prisoners are disinfected. Hoffy, Price and Duke are not pleased with Sefton's ventures, fearing that the Germans will find out and punish them more harshly than ever. During a session where Sefton has the telescope set up, Harry Shapiro and Animal try to sneak into the Russian prisoners camp to look inside the windows of the delousing shack, using a pot of white paint to mark a line down the center of the road. They're caught immediately by a German guard and escape when they slap him in the eyes with the brush.A new prisoner arrives; Lieutenant James Dunbar, who is being housed at 17 until the Germans ship him to the officers camp. Dunbar is greeted warmheartedly and comically by the rest of the barracks. However, there is instant friction between him and Sefton. Sefton, from the same suburb of Boston, tells everyone that Dunbar is from a wealthy family and should be pampered during his stay. Dunbar lets the first few comments go but tells Sefton that he can resent his family's wealth but he should tread cautiously. Sefton tells Dunbar that his family fortune won't protect him in the camp. Sefton leaves the barracks, to an unknown destination.The rest of the men ask Dunbar about how he was captured & brought to the camp. He was shot down on a bombardment mission and had been on his feet for three days without any sleep. He'd have been brought to Stalag 17 earlier but there was a major delay coming out of Frankfurt: a German munitions train was destroyed just outside the city and snarled much of the Reichsbahn transport for miles around. The sergeant that accompanied Dunbar, Bagradian, tells everyone that it was Dunbar himself that blew up the train. Dunbar is modest about the incident but tells everyone that he'd rigged a simple time bomb and tossed it aboard the train as it was leaving the station.Schultz shows up unexpectedly, telling the men they'll be getting new blankets. A visit from a representative of the Geneva Conventions is due to show up in a few days & the Commandant wants to give the appearance that the camp is complying with regulations. Hoffy scoffs and says that they know the blankets will be confiscated after the Geneva agent leaves. Schultz also confiscates the radio, playing coy for a bit before revealing it's hiding place in the bucket. He also sees that a new message has been left for him by the spy. He orders the men outside to get their blankets and retrieves the hidden message.After the men file back into the barracks they turn on Cookie, demanding to know where Sefton has been for the past few hours. With Hoffy's permission, Animal breaks into Sefton's footlocker & discovers a wealth of contraband that Sefton's been hoarding, including a cuckoo clock and silk stockings. Duke appears and tells them that he knows where Sefton disappeared to: he's been over at the Russian women's barracks partying with them. In a fury, Hoffy smashes Sefton's prized telescope.When Sefton returns, he finds the men staring angrily at him and that his footlockers have been broken into. Hoffy and the rest of the men suggest that he's the German spy they've been unable to identify. Sefton claims he's innocent and that the men should hold a kangaroo court. The Commandant suddenly makes an appearance and arrests Dunbar for suspicion of sabotaging the train that was destroyed near Frankfurt. Dunbar is taken into custody and the men become angrier with Sefton, immediately suspecting him. They turn on him and he is brutally beaten.The next morning, on Christmas Eve, the men are rousted out by Schultz to receive Red Cross parcels, brought by the Geneva agent. A mistaken shipment leaves the men with a large supply of ping-pong balls. Sefton is nearly unable to get out of bed and Schultz notices that he's been severely beaten. Sefton tries to bribe Schultz into revealing the identity of the traitor but is rebuffed. When the other prisoners walk in on them, their belief in Sefton as the traitor is reinforced. Hoffy tells Sefton that he tried to get Sefton transferred to another barracks but couldn't. Sefton tells everyone that he'll find out who the traitor is. Schultz walks in with the Geneva agent, who inspects the barracks and sees through the ruse of beautifying the camp: the blankets smell of moth balls & the meat promised in the men's meal is missing. When he asks Price and Harry about the conditions they live in, they both give non-committal answers but refuse to speak up about problems. When he questions Sefton about his obvious injuries, Sefton refuses to rat out his fellow prisoners. Hoffy takes the opportunity to tell the agent about Dunbar being taken to the Commandant's quarters without formal charges and the agent promises to investigate.At the Commandant's apartment, Dunbar is being forced to stand upright in an attempt to make him confess. Dunbar has held out but is rapidly becoming weaker with the lack of sleep he had while being taken to the camp. After talking a bit about how he became a prison camp warden, he places a call to his superior to let him know he has caught the saboteur responsible for the Frankfort train explosion. When the Geneva agent arrives, he asks about Lt Dunbar. The agent tells von Scherbach that he cannot torture Dunbar in this manner without proof. The Commandant agrees and says he'll find out about the time bomb Dunbar allegedly used.Later in the day, the men celebrate with a small tree they decorate with their dog tags. The men have traded Sefton's distillery equipment for the camp's phonograph and begin to sing ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"". Price steals away from the group and sees that the cord for the light used to flag a message has been looped. Revealing himself as the traitor, he's able to switch the black queen for a new one. When the marching line of his barracksmates catches up to him, he enthusiastically joins them. Sefton, still recovering in his bed, notices that the loop in the cord is gone.Later, while playing horseshoes with Bagradian, Price asks him how the Lieutenant could have carried any explosive device with him through the German prisoner searches in the train station. Bagradian tells him Dunbar simply folded a lit cigarette into a book of matches. When the cigarette burned down it lit the matches, causing a fire that detonated the ammunition.That night the men gather around the tree and sing ""O, Come All Ye Faithful"". Sefton notices that the loop in the cord has reappeared. The solemnity of the evening is ruined when the camp lights go out & Schultz tells them all to evacuate and take refuge in the trenches used in case of bombings. Schultz waits until everyone leaves and begins talking in German to Price. He shows Schultz how Dunbar sabotaged the train using the method Bagradian told him about. After they leave, Sefton steps out from a hiding spot, having heard the whole conversation.On Christmas Day the men throw a party in their barracks with music and much of the liquor and wine that Sefton had been hoarding. Sefton talks to a suspicious Cookie about the traitor in their midst. Sefton talks about the potential consequences of revealing the traitor to the others & what punishment they'd face if they killed the man outright. Sefton suggests that a well-constructed plan to rid themselves of the traitor and appear blameless is needed. Cookie suggests that Sefton tell Hoffy or Price. Sefton takes the suggestion to heart.Hoffy shows up and announces that the SS has arrived to take Dunbar into custody -- his method for destroying the ammo train has been uncovered. Hoffy tells the men that they've come up with a plan to rescue Dunbar from the SS. All the men from the other barracks will disperse outside and help with a diversion. Sefton seizes the opportunity to demand that he stay in the barracks & be guarded by someone they trust -- Sefton suggests Price.Outside, the men have Steve drop a smudge pot crafted from ground ping-pong balls from his empty pantleg onto the ground near the SS agents car. When the cover from it is thick enough, also making it impossible for the tower guards to open fire, a small group of the men rush the SS guards and grab Dunbar, hiding him. The commandant is furious and runs checks of every man against their records. The barracks are thoroughly searched and the prisoners are forced to stand in the appelplatz for six straight hours, however Dunbar is never found. It is later revealed that Dunbar is hiding out in one of the water towers above one of the latrines.That night Hoffy calls a meeting where they'll collect everyone's dog tags, with the notable exception of Joey and Sefton, and draw the name of the man who will get Dunbar out of the water tower and out of the camp through the barbed wire. When the name is drawn, Price takes the tag and says he'll go. He figures that his work as barracks security chief has been less than adequate and he'd like to make it up to the men. Another trap door is cut in the floor and as he prepares to leave, Sefton steps forward and announces another wager that Dunbar will never make it out of the camp. The men are instantly furious with him but he slowly begins to reveal Price as the traitor: he approaches Price and asks him where he was when Pearl Harbor was bombed. Price slips up, saying he was having dinner at six in the evening, but in Germany, when when America was getting the news earlier in the day. Sefton tells everyone that Price had sworn loyalty to his family's homeland and had gone back to Germany when the war broke out, he'd been trained as spy and was planted in the camp. Price tries to escape through the trap door but is easily caught and subdued. Sefton then tells everyone that he'll be the man to get Dunbar out -- he likes the odds because now they can use Price as a decoy. Considering that he'd sent Johnson and Manfredi out to their deaths when they tried to escape, Hoffy and the other prisoners are eager for payback. They'll throw him out the door with cans tied to his leg and he'll draw the searchlights and gunfire from the Germans in the guard towers.Sefton slips down through the trapdoor, bidding everyone farewell and sneaks over to the latrine. He gets a freezing Dunbar down from the water tank and waits for the signal from his comrades. When Price is thrown out into the appelplatz he draws fire from all the towers, despite his cries for help in German. As he desperately tries to approach the commandant's offices, he's gunned down. At the edge of the camp, Sefton cuts through the wire fence and he and Dunbar escape into the woods. In the appelplatz, the commandant and Schultz first smile at the corpse lying the mud but are quickly chagrined to find that it's not Dunbar, but Price. In the barracks, the men reflect on how well Sefton's plan worked. The Animal suggests that Sefton merely wanted to steal their wirecutters. Cookie happily begins whistling the theme of the Army Air Force."

tt0046378,"['Crime', 'Drama']","A thirty-something couple are killing time late at night on a bench. When two female police constables pass by, the man insists on moving on, in case the police want to question them. The couple look over a wall at the river, where two boys are playing, despite the late hour. They run across some walkway planks and one falls in. The woman dives in and rescues the boy, and two policewomen get involved.
The couple admit to the police women that they are homeless, having been evicted. The couple turn up at the police station the next morning, and are interviewed by a well-meaning female police officer. The woman, Edna Hurran, admits she hasn't got any papers, and that she has deserted from the army. The police officer says that she will put in a good word with the woman's commanding officer.
Next the police women go to a slum block of flats, enquiring about a toddler that is regularly left alone. The Mother is Mrs Dawson, but she goes out to work and leaves the toddler alone in the house. Neighbouring women confirm that the baby is regularly left alone and cries. While the conversation is going on, they see the little girl climb out of a high window, and inch along a pediment. The danger is obvious and one of the police officers breaks in to the flat and tries to rescue the child. She herself inches along the pediment and manages to grasp the infant. A fire appliance arrives and a ladder is extended, and firemen climb up and take the child down to safety, and the police woman follows, to applause from, the bystanders.
Now a female CID officer is called to a case of suspected shoplifting; a young woman Bridget Foster, has stolen some baby clothing, and despite her protestations, it is obvious she is guilty. She has a baby with her. She is charged by an unsympathetic male officer, who repeatedly demands that the child should be silenced. Her husband Stanley comes to sign something, and they leave the police station; they argue about money. She will have to go to court on her own as he has to leave town because of his job. If she gets fined, how will she find the money?
One of the women officers now appears in her best clothes; she is off on a plain clothes assignment apparently at a dance hall. Meanwhile a young boy has appeared at the police station, and won't speak to anyone. Some officers interview Mrs Dawson; she is hostile, and it is obvious she is a poor mother. The Mother of the young boy who was at the police station now comes for him, and complains that the police are encouraging small children to go there.
Bridget Foster appears in court and gets fined ¬£5. A man called Ray, whom she met in a club pays the fine for her, and he tells her to come to the club that evening. Shortly afterwards he arranges to steal a van that is making deliveries to jewellers' shops. The van contains a safe, and they take it to a workshop where it is cut open. A large collection of jewellery is inside. That night at the club the Ray gives Bridget an expensive bracelet, without telling her that it is part of the proceeds of the robbery. Bridget's Mother-in-law has taken Bridget's baby by this time, and Bridget seems unconcerned.
Now in the police station an older woman has come to complain that a man has been following her; she is interviewed sympathetically, but it seems to be fantasy, and she is sent home.
Edna Hurran, who deserted from the army, is now returned to her unit and appears before her CO. Another day a journalist appears there; his newspaper published the story about her rescuing the boy; readers have sent in donations and the newspaper has made the money up to ¬£300; he gives her a cheque.
Bridget Foster's husband has now returned from the work that took him away from home; he reports his wife missing; he didn't know about the fine being paid, nor who could have done so.
Chick goes to a fence with the jewellery on Ray's behalf and gets some money. The jeweller, Muller, pays Chic much less than Ray hoped, and Ray decides to get his revenge on Muller.
That evening two WPCs go to see Mr Dawson about the toddler who was left alone. It turns out that the baby is by his wife, and that his present partner (""Mrs Dawson"") came later. The police go and find the real mother, Mrs Propert, who is distraught that the baby might have been in danger.
A man phones the police and says that he is the husband of Edna Hurran; he wants to get in touch with her, to get his share of the ¬£300. At the Army base it emerges that Edna has married bigamously.
Ray visits Muller, the jeweller, taking an unwilling accomplice, Pinky, with him. He pretends they are police officers searching for stolen goods, which they themselves have stolen; it was Chick who saw Muller and sold the goods to him. Ray threatens Mueller with jail and take the jewellery and some cash, and blackmail him, telling him to get another ¬£500. Muller's wife persuades him to consult a solicitor friend, who advises him to tell the police.
At the police station there is a briefing; tonight there will be a raid on the club run by Ray. All drinks on the tables must be impounded as evidence, so presumably the raid is because the club doesn't have a drinks licence.
That night Mrs Muller goes to the police station herself. Meanwhile Ray goes to Muller's shop and claiming to be a policeman, gains entry. He coshes Muller and takes cash from the safe, using Muller's keys.
Bridget is arrested as part of the raid on the club, and she is wearing the brooch given her by Ray; the police realise it tallies with the stolen jewellery; she refuses to say how she got it, so the police let her go and put a tail on her. She goes to Ray, but he is tipped off that the police are waiting outside his flat, and he makes his escape and drives off; he abandons the car later.
Mr and Mrs Propert turn up at the police station, and declare that they wish to adopt the baby, that was being looked after by Mrs Dawson, having changed their mind.
Ray and Bridget are hiding out with Chick, and Bridget goes out to buy some food. By coincidence one of the WPCs spots her and follows her back to the hideout; Ray spots her and starts to make his escape. The WPC tries to stop him from getting into the escape car, but Ray and Chick overpower her and strike her to the ground. A police car arrives, and after a thrilling chase Ray and Chick are caught with the aid of a police dog.
Edna Hurran is now on trial at the Old Bailey on a bigamy charge, but is given the most lenient sentence possible, two days in jail, which she has already served on remand."

Forester determines that the watches have been somehow magnetized, and also notes that someone's pocket compass points not to the north, but to the meteorite. Forester returns to the site with the sheriff and another deputy. They find the ashes of the three men surrounding by extreme scorching, and then the probe attacks again, killing the deputy as he tries to drive away. Forester then determines that they are dealing with something from another planet and need to call in the military, especially as another fireball lands nearby as he is talking to the sheriff. While everyone waits for the soldiers to arrive, Forester appears on a radio program and deals with the increasing speculation on the otherworldly origin of the cylinders. A consensus arises that the cylinders come from Mars, now at its closest approach to Earth.Marines from El Toro Marine Base roll in and surround the site, and an Air Force plane drops a flare on it from above. The long-necked probe fires its heat ray at the plane, and then sweeps the area, destroying a radio truck. The Marine colonel calls for reinforcements, and the 6th Army Command arrives, with artillery and tanks. Major General Mann, the commander, tells Forester that other objects like the one they are surrounding have landed in cities all over the world, and that all communication fails after that. Then the probe rises again, and we now see that it is part of a swan-like magnetically levitating low-altitude craft. Two other such craft rise out of the cylinder to join it. The officers give the order to prepare to fire, but Matthew Collins objects, saying that no one has tried to offer them peace before. Disregarding his own safety, he walks toward the three metal swans, reciting the 23rd psalm--and before his niece Sylvia's horrified eyes, the lead swan burns him to death. At once General Mann (Les Tremayne) and Marine Colonel Heffner (Vernon Rich) give the order to fire.The soldiers unleash a barrage of artillery and missile fire--and none of it is effective. The swans possess a magnetic ""blister"" (a force shield) that deflects any bombardment. The swans quietly take the measure of their opponents and then start to return fire, with heat rays and meson-disrupting energy bursts that disintegrate anything they touch. Forester urges Mann to inform Washington that conventional military forces would be outmatched. Mann leaves, and Heffner fights a holding action before finally ordering a complete retreat--and being disintegrated in mid-sentence.Forester takes Sylvia with him in an Army plane. Flying low to avoid the Air Force jets flying in to try their hand, he clips some trees and crash-lands. He and Sylvia barely have time to escape before a squadron of swans surround the plane. General Mann returns to the city, where skeptical reporters cannot believe his reassurances--and of course he knows better, because nothing has proved effective.Alone in the brush, Forester and Sylvia take shelter in an abandoned farmhouse. There Sylvia confesses her fears and her deep sense of loss following her uncle's death. In the middle of this tender conversation, another cylinder crashes into the side of the house, demolishing most of it and knocking Forester unconscious. Hours later, Forester wakes up, and a terrified Sylvia tells him that the house is surrounded. Forester works diligently to clear a way out, while also trying to observe as much as he can. The Martians lower a different kind of probe, an eye-like camera; Forester, at first taking this for yet another weapon, chops the probe's head from its extender, which swiftly withdraws. A Martian crewman quietly enters the house and touches Sylvia on the shoulder; Forester blinds it with a flashlight and then throws an axe at it, putting it to flight. When Forester realizes that he is holding a scarf now stained with Martian blood, Sylvia loses all control, and Forester has to shout at her to calm down. They then escape, just before the Martians burn down the ruins of the house.As more cylinders come down all over the earth, the Martians' goal becomes painfully clear: to drive all of humanity before them and eventually to kill us all. In Washington, the Secretary of Defense prepares to order the dropping of an atomic bomb on the Los Angeles-area nest. Forester and Sylvia finally arrive at Pacific Tech and turn over the alien camera and the blood-stained scarf. The blood turns out to be anemic, and the camera yields little insight other than that the Martians perceive color a lot differently from humans and that their ability to see is hampered by bright light. At the time, Pacific Tech officials think all this is a moot point, because the atom bomb is going to stop them anyway. But even the atom bomb proves ineffective against the Martians' magnetic force fields.General Mann, clearly frustrated, orders an evacuation of Los Angeles. Forester tells his colleagues that now the anemic blood is important, because only biological weapons will stop the Martians now. The plan is to take as many lab instruments as possible into the mountains and set up another laboratory. But that plan comes to nothing, as looters seize the Pacific Tech vehicles and scatter or beat up all the personnel, including Forester, the pathologist who found out about the anemia, Dr. Dupre (Ann Codee), and Sylvia. As the swans arrive and start systematically burning every building in sight, Forester rushes about, going from church to church, hoping to find Sylvia waiting there, as she once waited after running away as a child. He finds church pastors everywhere praying for deliverance, comfort, or both, and at one church he even finds two of his colleagues. At last he finds Sylvia--and as the two rush toward one another, a nearby swan burns out a stained-glass window, frightening everyone inside.But the attacking swan abruptly heels over, fires only two more seemingly half-hearted bursts, and then crashes into a building and falls to the street. Dead silence descends. Inside the church, Forester leads the people out into the street to see what has happened. They find the downed swan, and as they watch, a door opens and a Martian arm appears, trying to move out. Another swan crashes on the other side of the street and, as Forester watches, the Martian arm turns a mottled gray and falls still. Forester touches it and pronounces it dead.The story repeats itself all over the Earth. The Martians had very underdeveloped immune systems, and as soon as they were exposed to Earth's atmosphere, they became infected with germs that humans have long since developed immunity to, but which proved uniformly fatal to Martians. The metal swans stop and fall where they are, and the invasion is over even more swiftly than it began."

The U.S. government invites Professor Pierre M. Aronnax (Paul Lukas) and his assistant, Conseil (Peter Lorre), to join an expedition to prove or disprove the monster's existence. On board the armed frigate with them is the cocky master harpooner Ned Land (Kirk Douglas).After months of searching, the ""monster"" is spotted after another merchant ship nearby explodes and sinks. After the warship fires its heavy cannons, the monster turns and attacks the frigate, crippling it. Ned and Aronnax are thrown overboard, as is a lifeboat, and Conseil jumps in after Aronnax to save him. Now helpless, the frigate drifts silently and no one aboard answers when the overboard passengers cry out for help. The three drift in the ocean, eventually coming upon a strange-looking metal vessel. They realize the ""monster"" is actually a man-made ""submerging boat"" that appears deserted. Inside, they find a large viewing port amidships and watch a strange underwater funeral procession.Ned, Aronnax and Conseil are spotted, and as they attempt to leave in their lifeboat, the crew returns to their submarine and capture the three castaways. The captain introduces himself as Nemo (James Mason), master of the Nautilus. He returns Ned and Conseil to the deck, while offering Aronnax, whose name he recognizes from Aronnax's scientific work and research, the chance to stay. When Nemo discovers that Aronnax is willing to die with his companions, he finds out what he needed to know and allows Ned and Conseil to stay aboard.Over the next several weeks, Captain Nemo shows Ned, Aronnax and Conseil around his submarine from its power station (an early type of atomic reactor which powers the sub), and the various ways the sub runs. Nemo allows his three ""guests"" to come and go around the Nautilus, but forbids them from trying to escape. Nemo takes the Nautilus on a series of adventures to various places in the Pacific and Aronnaux is both impressed and unsettled by Nemo's free-spirited thoughts of the world and places and islands they visit to gather food and supplies for the crew.Ned makes friends with a sea lion pet of Nemo's whom he spends most of his time with while in his cabin and wondering through the submarine.Nemo takes Aronnax to the penal colony island of Rura Penthe. Nemo reveals he was once a prisoner there, as were many of his crew. The prisoners are loading an ammunition ship. That evening, the Nautilus rams and sinks the ship at sea, destroying its cargo and killing all its crew. An anguished Nemo tells Arronax that his actions have saved thousands from death in war; he also discloses that this ""hated nation"" tortured his wife and son to death while attempting to force from him the secrets of his advanced work.While the crew repair some damage to the Nautilus' rudder caused by the sinking of the merchant ship, Ned and Conseil sneak into Nemo's cabin and discover the coordinates of Nemo's secret base, a small island called Vulcania. After writing down the coordinates and sneaking out of the room, Ned writes out and releases several messages in bottles containing the island's isolated location, hoping somebody will find and free them from captivity.One day while off the coast of New Guinea, the Nautilus becomes stranded on a reef. Ned is surprised when Nemo allows him to go ashore with Conseil unescorted, ostensibly to collect wildlife specimens. Ned goes off alone to explore avenues of escape. While kneeling at a pool to drink some water, he sees a number of human skulls on stakes. Realizing his danger, Ned runs for his life and rejoins Conseil as they are chased back to the Nautilus by cannibal natives. Despite remaining aground, Nemo is unconcerned, and the cannibals are repelled from the ship by electrical charges through the outer hull. Nemo is furious with Ned for not following his orders to stay on the beach and confines him to the submarine's brig.Just then, a warship approaches, firing on the Nautilus. After a cannon shot hits the submarine, it slides off the reef and down into the depths, where it attracts the attention of a giant squid. An electric hull charge fails to repel the creature, so Nemo and his men surface during a violent storm to dislodge the beast. Nemo is quickly caught in one of the squid's tentacles. Ned, having escaped from captivity during the struggle, harpoons the creature, killing it, and jumps to Nemo's rescue, saving his captor from drowning as the dead squid sinks away. As a result, Nemo has a change of heart and decides to make peace with the outside world.As the Nautilus nears Vulcania, Nemo finds the island surrounded by warships, whose marines are converging on his hidden base in an interior lagoon. Nemo navigates the Nautilus through an underwater channel to the lagoon where his base it. As Nemo goes ashore alone, armed marines appear on the ridge and attack. Ned attempts to identify himself as the author of the bottled messages, but they do not appear to hear him. Aronnax realizes this and becomes furious at Ned, recognizing that Nemo will soon destroy all evidence of his discoveries. Nemo triggers a time bomb in his large complex, but is badly wounded from a rifle bullet to his back while returning to the Nautilus. After haphazardly navigating the submarine away from Vulcania through the underwater channel, Nemo announces he will be ""taking the Nautilus down for the last time"". The First Mate and the rest of Nemo's crew declare they will accompany their captain in death.Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned are confined to their cabins. The Nautilus' crew also retreat to their cabins at Nemo's instructions. Ned breaks loose and manages to surface the Nautilus, hitting a reef in the process, causing the submarine to begin flooding. Ned soon fights with the First Mate, but manages to knock him out and leaves him behind. Meanwhile, Nemo staggers to his grand salon's viewing port, and as he looks into the depths of his beloved blue ocean he succumbs to his fatal gunshot wound.As Ned frees Aronnax and Conseil from their quarters, Aronnax tries to retrieve his journal, which contains a full account of their voyage, but the urgency of their escape obliges Ned to knock him unconscious and carry him out. From a safe distance away aboard the Nautilus' lifeboat skiff, Ted, Aronnaux, Conseil and Nemo's pet sea lion witness Vulcania destroyed by an enormous atomic-like explosion, and Ned apologizes to Aronnax for hitting him. As the now adrift Nautilus is swamped by the tsunami waves caused by the explosions, it disappears beneath the waves, as Nemo's last words to Aronnax echo: ""There is hope for the future. And when the world is ready for a new and better life, all this will someday come to pass, in God's good time""."

George Bryan Brummell. When the prince pays his compliments, Brummell responds with suggestions for improving the design of the regiment's uniforms, and George, who designed the uniforms himself, is offended. Brummell, a man of exacting sartorial and Epicurean tastes, is unfazed by the prince's disapproval, and makes an appearance that evening, wearing daring stove pipe pants, at a regimental dinner. There he meets the beautiful Lady Patricia Belham, the intended of George's political advisor, Lord Edwin Mercer. When Brummell refuses to retract his criticism of the uniforms, the prince discharges him from the service.Late that night, as Brummell watches his regiment embark on an overseas assignment, Patricia approaches him and asks why he is willing to sacrifice his military career. The proud Brummell explains that he is unwilling to compromise his dignity and self-respect, and impulsively kisses her. Brummell is left with no clear course for the future, however, as he has neither family name nor fortune. While strolling through town one day with his loyal valet Mortimer, Brummell sees politician Sir Ralph Sidley addressing a crowd. Brummell interrupts Sidley's speech with some sharply worded comments about the prince, and a newspaper reporter invites him to repeat his opinions the following evening at a civic meeting. Brummell accepts, and quickly makes a name for himself with his stinging indictment of the prince's excesses.Later, George is urged by Mercer and his prime minister, William Pitt, to end his relationship with his widowed, Catholic lover, Mrs. Maria Anne Fitzherbert, and make an advantageous marriage. Brummell is summoned by the prince, and as he urges George to stand up to Pitt, a bond begins to grow between the two men. One evening, when Brummell returns from the prince's birthday party, Mortimer warns him that his numerous creditors are growing impatient and suggests they go abroad. Brummell, who has become George's close friend and confidant, refuses, insisting that the prince needs him. Patricia drops by, and after Brummell shows her his exquisitely furnished house, they admit their strong feelings for each other. Patricia considers him too unstable to be a good candidate for marriage, however, and Brummell soon learns that her engagement to Mercer will be announced at an upcoming hunting party. Brummell is present at the gathering, and the prince publicly praises him for his devotion, promising to make Brummell an earl when he becomes king.While the other guests are fox hunting, Brummell and Patricia find themselves alone in the woods, and they fall into a passionate embrace. After the hunt, Mercer brusquely tells Patricia they should cancel their engagement, but she promises never to see Brummell again. The following morning, the distraught prince tells Brummell that Mrs. Fitzherbert is planning to leave for Italy. Brummell tells the prince that Pitt has been concealing the fact that King George III has gone mad. He urges the prince to have his father certified insane and declare himself regent, which would empower him to marry whomever he pleases.With Brummell and several doctors at his side, the prince goes to court and calls on George III, who is declared mad after he fails to recognize his son and tries to strangle him. Parliament limits the prince's power as acting regent, although it does grant him authority to change the marriage act, which forbids marriage to a Catholic, and make it possible for George to wed Mrs. Fitzherbert. Brummell advises the prince to reject Parliament's conditions, however, or lose power to Pitt. Emotionally overwrought, the prince turns on Brummell, accusing him of acting out of self-interest. Brummell insults the prince, and their close friendship ends. When his break with the prince becomes known, Brummell's creditors close in, and Brummell and Mortimer flee to Calais, France.

Excited, he explains to the native workers that he needs to go back to the institute on the coast to get help to dig out the rest of the fossil. Hidden from view, a claw, similar to the one found in the fossil, rears out onto a river bank, then slides back into the water.At the institute Dr David Reed (Richard Carlson) meets Maia, who seems surprised to find Reed in Brazil. Reed explains they're researching lung fish. The rest of the conversation centers around Maia remembering when Reed was a student.Maia asks Reed about why he never married Kay Lawrence (Julie Adams) He explains she's never been able to talk him into it. Maia then shows Reed a photo of the fossil he found and believes it is hundreds of million years old. Reed immediately takes an interest and wants to go back up river to recover the rest of the fossil.At the institute discussions occur about the meaning of the fossil, it is generally agreed it was an amphibian and probably very strong. Dr Williams (Richard Denning) agrees the fossil is a major find, and as one of the directors gives the go ahead for a larger expedition to go back up river and dig the rest of it out.Back at the campsite it is night and the workers are preparing to settle down for the night. One sees a creature enter the tents and kills both occupants.Sometime later the expedition is making its way upstream on the Rita, a battered motor vessel with little comfort. Captain Lucas (Nestor Paiva) explains how deadly and large all the life around the Amazon River is. The boat docks and the crew quickly discover the campsite has been destroyed and the men are dead. They consider it could have been a jaguar.
.
Despite the situation the crew clean up the camp and work begins retrieving the fossil. After eight days no fossil remains are found. Reed figures that perhaps the fossil had been washed away from the river bank, and the remains might be located further downstream in a lagoon, The Black Lagoon. Capt Lucas explains that many people have gone to the lagoon over the years, but none have come back.Reed and Kay have a romantic moment as the boat is moved. They discuss their plans to marry and settle down together. The boat pushes towards the lagoon, it is a very tight fit through a section of the river, but it soon opens up to the lagoon. Reed Reed and Williams break out the aqua-lungs to dive the lagoon and investigate the local life forms. The men successfully complete their mission not realizing they are being stalked by the creature. Williams is jealous of the attention Kay is giving to Reed. To break the tension she goes for a swim.The creature swims along with her, mimicking some of her swimming moves, unsure what to make of the situation. At one point it briefly grazes her leg while she is floating on the surface. Rather than be surprised, she dives to investigate, further firing the creature's curiosity.Back on board, the boat is upset by the pressure being put on the net. Quickly they try to haul the net in, only to discover a huge tear in the net and what appears to be a fang or claw. Kay begins to wonder now exactly what might have touched her while swimming.Williams decides to go back down and hunt whatever is in the lagoon. Reed opposes the course of action, but is over ruled. While on the dive the two men catch sight of the creature and attempt to shoot it with a spear fishing gun. They hit it once but it escapes before they can capture it.Lucas tells the men when they get back on board that there was an old river legend about a gill man who lived underwater. Reed things he has photographed the creature but the images appear blank. On deck one of the men is attacked and dragged into the water by the creature.Lucas tells the team about a native poison he has which makes fish come to the surface. All agree it is a good idea and begin spreading it over the lagoon. After some time a huge number of fish float to the surface but no sign of the creature. They surmise the poison is not getting down deep enough and create some pellets to flush the creature from the bottom. They wait for hours well into the night with no result. As the survey the lagoon the creature, unaffected by the poison ,attempts to climb into the boat . He is frightened by the light of a lantern. They see a trail of bubbles leading to the bank. When they fix a search light on it, the creature suddenly rears up, roars and disappears.Reed and Willliams follow the creature, discovering a cave hidden by the bank. They begin tracking footprints through the sand. The creature doubles back on the men. Reaching the boat it kills one of the crew then attempts to kidnap Kay. Wounded and suffering the effects of the drugs, the creature collapses.Reed and Williams build a makeshift cage and contain the creature, then go back to document the cave and leave doctor Thompson (Whit Bissell) and Kay discuss what the future holds. The creature breaks free and attacks Thompson. He has the presence of mind to smash a lantern over the creature setting it on fire but is gravely injured.Williams wants to stay try and recapture the creature. Reed and the rest of the team argue that with four people dead, the best thing is leave with the evidence and data they have. Williams clashes with Lucas who pulls a knife on Williams and explains they are leaving right now.As the boat heads out of the lagoon, it is blocked by a snag that was not there before. It is assumed the creature did this to stop them from leaving. They try to clear the snag with a winch but the obstruction is too heavy. Infuriated, the creature breaks the links, bringing attempt to an end.Reed decides to try again using the aqualung. He and Williams again clash, this time ending with Williams being knocked out. Reed then goes over the side. While preoccupied with the work he does not see the creature until Williams appears and tries to shoot the animal with the spear gun. On the second attempt he manages to hit the creature, but loses him. The creature counter attacks and drags Williams into the depths. A life and death struggle continues till Reed, realizing the dange,r comes to the rescue. Defeated, the creature once again retreats to the depths, leaving a badly injured Williams floating on the surface.Williams is ultimately killed in the attack. The team decides to try the poison again, this time just to slow the creature down while they try to clear the snag. Reed goes back into the water armed with the poison and begins work on the snag. Reed waits for the creature to get to very close range and fires twice, enveloping the creature in the paralyzing poison. Reed tries yet a third time before succeeding.The plan works and the lagoon is cleared. Preoccupied by the activity they don't see the creature climb on board. The creature spots Kay and drags her over the side, taking her back to his cave. Reed follows armed once again with the spear gun. Reed finds Kay but the creature stops the rescue by attacking Reed. Two of the crew coming from the beach entrance of the cave open fire hitting him multiple times.The creature retreats back into the water badly injured.

Subsequent events show that this is far from the case. Wallis, a dedicated scientist, devotes all the time he has (including family time) to develop a totally new 5 ton bomb. His initial struggles with an uninterested war ministry are graphically portrayed. When he asks for a Wellington bomber to test his bomb, the irate minister says ""They are worth their weight in gold. What possible justification can I give for such a request?"" Barnes replies, ""You could tell them I designed it."" At the Scampton RAF base, a weary Wing Commander Guy Gibson (Richard Todd) and his crew are completing a tour of 30 sorties over Germany. Just as they are looking forward to well earned leave, Gibson is asked to form a new squadron. By now Barnes is dropping nearly full-sized bombs off Reculver, but they are bursting rather than bouncing over the sea. Again and again, Gibson travels down to the Kent coast only to see another failure. Wallis asks if the bombers can fly at just 60 feet rather than the 150 feet originally requested. Guy points out that the altimeters are not accurate enough to fly at such low level without crashing. But later Gibson is watching a show in London and the spotlights focusing on the star on stage give him the answer. Lights are mounted in the nose and tail of each Lancaster bomber and set to converge on the ground at 60 feet. The raid is now on but while the crews of 617 Squadron are being briefed, Gibson's faithful dog Nigger is run over. Not a good omen for the coming attack. Poignant scenes of the very young-looking bomber crews sitting around waiting to depart, culminating in Gibson saying ""My watch says it's time to go."" Dramatic scenes of crews driving out to their dispersed Lancasters and then engines starting and serried ranks of the huge four-engine bombers lining up to take off. The low-level flight to the target dams commences with some beautiful shots of the Lancs skimming over the moonlit English Channel. Soon enough they hear ""Enemy coast ahead,"" and with a flurry of flak the bombers are twisting and turning their way to their target. Meanwhile Barnes Wallis is in the ops room at Scampton, monitoring the progress of the raid. All is silent and all eyes are on a special phone that will bring news of the raid's progress. 617 Squadron are now well on their way but suddenly get caught by AA guns over a city. One Lancaster is shot down, exploding as it hits the ground.Finally the planes arrive over the Mohne lake, looking very peaceful in the moonlight. The bombers can only attack one at a time so Gibson makes the first run. He levels out. The bomb aimer raises his simple wooden ""coat hanger"" bombsight while the navigator watches the lights coming together on the lake surface as the bomber approaches 60 feet. ""Bomb gone!"" Then a howl from Merlin engines being thrashed at full power to get away from the explosion. For such an old film the dam bomb bursts are well done. The Lancs take turns making their runs. One fails to pull up and its bomb goes over the dam wall, exploding under the plane's tail. Each run is reported back to Scampton and the small group of officers waiting around the silent telephone. Suddenly it rings and morse code can be heard. But time and time again the code word for success is not transmitted. At the dam the flak has become murderous, so Gibson and another pilot fly their Lancasters in formation with a plane making its bomb run. The escorting Lancs flick their landing lights on and off to draw the guns from the attacking bomber, which releases its bomb, destroying the Mohne dam. The remaining bombers fly on to the Eder dam, where their success is repeated, and back at base the group waiting around the phone celebrates wildly as the news of the raid's success comes through the morse-beeping phone. The film closes with the surviving bombers wearily landing and the tired crews flopping out. Guy Gibson runs into Wallis, who is distraught over the numbers of bombers lost.

As they are led away to their deaths, the robe of Christ is given to former slave Demetrius (Victor Mature) for safekeeping. Mad emperor Caligula, mistakenly believing that it is the mysterious robe which bestows eternal life, orders his soldiers to find it at all costs. While ransacking the village of Demetrius during the search, a Roman soldier assaults Lucia (Debra Paget), the beautiful love interest of Demetrius. Demetrius rushes to her defense and attacks the centurion. He is sentenced to a gladiator school, where he draws the lustful attention of sensuous Messalina (Susan Hayward), the unsatisfied wife of Caligula's elderly uncle. Demetrius initially refuses to fight out of devotion to his Christian beliefs. But when he spurns the advances of Messalina, she is enraged and wants revenge. He is returned to the arena where he is forced to defend himself against several tigers, killing all of them. He becomes a hero to the crowds. Lucia goes to the gladiator school to see Demetrius, but Messalina allows her to fall into the hands of the gladiators. As one of the gladiators hungrily paws at her, a helpless Demetrius prays for her deliverance. She fights wildly before falling into a catatonic state resembling death. An embittered Demetrius renounces his faith and accepts a post as a centurion. Caligula sends Demetrius to the Christian enclave to personally find the robe, where he finds unconscious Lucia clutching the sacred robe. The emotional encounter sets him on the path to redemption."
tt0046911,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","The story takes place in a second-rate boarding school run by the tyrannical and mean Michel Delassalle (Meurisse). The school, though, is owned by Delassalle's teacher wife, the frail Christina (Clouzot), and Delassalle flaunts his relationship with Nicole Horner (Signoret), a teacher at the school. Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both.Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him.

tt0046912,"['Crime', 'Thriller']","Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is a former tennis player who married Margot (Grace Kelly) partly for her money. To please his wife, he has given up tennis and now sells sports equipment. Margot once had a relationship with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings), an American crime scriptwriter, but broke it off when he went back to the U.S. for a year.In time they stopped writing to each other, and when Mark returns to London she tells him that she burned all his letters but one. Margo explains to Mark that the letter was stolen by a blackmailer who demanded ¬£50, so Margot payed by mailing the money to a pawn shop location as intended, but the money was never picked up and the letter was never returned. Mark tells Margo that he wants to tell Tony about them so she can divorce Tony so she and Mark can be together, but Margot refuses out of fear of hurting Tony's feelings.It is also revealed that Tony and Margot have made their wills, naming each other as beneficiary with assets and money totaling ¬£90,000. For a year, Tony meticulously plans Margot's murder. She has no idea that Tony knows of her love for Mark. He has gone to great lengths to steal a handbag containing one of Mark's letters, and even assumed the role of the anonymous Brixton-based blackmailer to find out whether she would pay to have it back. (She did, but he asked for only ¬£50 and she did not, of course, get the letter back.) He even watched them having a little farewell party, eating spaghetti with mushrooms in Mark's studio flat in Chelsea.Tony slyly withdraws small amounts of money for a year, collecting ¬£1,000 in (used) one-pound (¬£1) notes, with which he plans to pay a contract killer. He singles out the perfect man to do the job: Charles Alexander ""C.A."" Swann (Anthony Dawson), who now calls himself ""Captain Lesgate"", a former acquaintance who has embarked on a life of petty crime since even before leaving Cambridge where he and Tony were both students. By following him and finding out about his past and associations, Tony soon gets enough to blackmail Swann into murdering his wife.Tony uses the opportunity of Mark's return to London to carry out his plan. Under a pretext he has to prepare an urgent report for his boss, he has Margot and Mark go to the theatre and, when they are gone, he invites Swann to his flat under another pretext - wanting to buy an expensive car from him. When Swann arrives at 61A Charrington Gardens that night, Tony gets down to business. There is no time to lose, as he has planned the murder for the following night. Trapped in a corner by the revelations of his past crimes and tempted by the money, Swann reluctantly agrees to carry out the murder.Tony has invited Mark to join him at a stag party in a nearby hotel; this is how he secures himself an alibi. The idea is that the police should think that a burglar was surprised by Margot, that he panicked, strangled her and left without the loot. He has told Swann that he is going to phone his own flat at exactly 11:00 p.m. so that Margot will come to the living-room to answer the phone, whereupon she will be murdered by Swann. There are only two keys to the Wendices' ground floor apartment. Before leaving for the stag party, Tony steals Margot's key from her handbag and hides it under the stair carpet outside their flat for Swann to use.Mark, a writer of crime scenarios, says at one point that, theoretically, he would be able to plan the perfect murder but that it would be impossible to carry out any plan of his because in real life people just do not act according to other people's plans. This is true of Margot, too: Instead of listening to the radio in her bedroom when Tony and Mark are away, she tells her husband of her own plans to go to the cinema that night. Tony has a hard time persuading his wife to instead stay at home and stick into an album some old newspaper clippings of his when he was a tennis star. Margot finally consents and for that reason takes a (seemingly) huge pair of scissors out of her mending basket (which also contains a pair of her stockings). When she has finished the tiresome job she goes to bed, carelessly leaving the scissors lying on the desk next to the phone.According to Tony's plan, Swann secretly enters the Wendices' flat shortly before 11 o'clock, hides behind the drawn curtains, a scarf in his hands, and waits for the telephone to ring and for Margot to come out of her bedroom to answer it.At the dinner stag party, Tony's plans again nearly go wrong when his wristwatch stops and he has to ask for the time, and when he learns that it is a few minutes past 11:00, he hurriedly leaves the ballroom and to a payphone in the hotel lobby to make the call. Tony just makes the phone call exactly when Swann is considering leaving his flat. As expected, Margot gets up, enters the living room area, and awnsers the phone. When she does, the plan goes terribly wrong: Swann attacks her from behind with Tony all the while listening in to what is going on over the phone. But Margot turns out to be rather strong and eventually stabs Swann in the back with the scissors that are left on the desk. He falls backwards to the floor, right onto the scissors, and is dead at once. In his panic, Tony tells his sobbing wife not to touch or do anything until he has come home, which he hurriedly does.Clearly nervous, Tony has to work fast now if he wants to come up with an new plan to kill Margot. He soon realizes he can make it look as if Margot had been blackmailed by Swann, that he came to her flat in person and that she actually let him in with the intention of murdering him (rather than killing him in self-defense). After calling the police and sending Margot back to bed, he plants Mark's letter on Swann (to make it appear that he was the one who sent blackmail letters to Margot), finds the latch key on Swann and puts it back in Margot's handbag, and burns the scarf that Swann used, replacing it with one of Margot's stockings. He hides the twin stocking on the desk, but intentionally ""accidentally"" uncovers it for the police to find (making it look as though Margot inflicted the bruises by herself). Finally, Tony tells Margot to deny that he told her not to call the police. Although he tells her that it will lessen the police suspicion, it has the opposite effect, making it appear as though she avoided calling the police.Eventually, the police establish that Swann came in through the hall door rather than the French windows leading into the garden, as his shoes are not dirty. After an intermission, we are introduced to Inspector Hubbard (John Williams), who questions the Wendices and appears to believe the evidence that Tony planted, eventually becoming highly suspicious of Margot. The movie cuts immediately to the trial scene where she is convicted and sentenced to be hanged, thus accomplishing Tony's plan after all.However, there are two things Tony has not reckoned with: (a) that Swann replaced the key under the stair carpet immediately after using it to open the door and, accordingly, the key he takes out of the dead man's pocket is the key to Swann's own flat; and (b) that getting rid of ¬£1,000 in cash (the money he would have paid to Swann, which he does not have to now that he is dead) by making many purchases is a conspicuous thing to do and bound to be investigated by the police (which it is, although Tony is not aware of this).Several months later, on the day before Margot's scheduled execution, Mark visits Tony to propose a very unusual thing to him. Rather than seeing his wife hanged, he could come up with a completely new story, confess at the last minute that he hired Swann to kill his wife and save her life by going to prison for some years himself instead. Coincidentally, Mark has come up with exactly what Tony actually did. Mark argues that during Margot's trial, all arguments revolved around three things only: (1) Mark's letter found on Swann; (2) the fact that no key was found on Swann (and that there was no forced entry either); and (3) Margot's stocking. Mark argues that all this could be altered, and that Tony could put all the blame on himself, claiming that it was he who had done all that.Then Inspector Hubbard arrives at the flat again, purportedly to ask Tony about the money he has been spending lately. This is when Mark discovers Tony's attach√© case filled with the remaining one pound notes and presents it to Hubbard when he inquires to Tony about the suitcase. Pressed for an answer, Tony manages a final impromptu lie in front of both Mark and Inspector Hubbard: he tells them this is the money Margot had ready when she met Swann but that she changed her mind and killed him instead of paying him off. The inspector accepts this explanation and dismisses Mark's theory... or so it seems.In fact, the inspector, who has not given up the case yet, remains suspicious of Tony and sets a trap. He borrows the key from Margot's handbag which is kept in prison and goes to Tony's flat while Tony is not home. He finds that it does not fit the lock. He discovers that the key actually fits Swann's door. After some searching, he discovers the actual key under the carpet.Then the inspector uses his final trick. He visits Tony to ask some questions and when he leaves, he deliberately takes Tony's raincoat instead of his own. (The raincoats are apparently very similar and so are the keys.) Tony also leaves his flat. Inspector Hubbard secretly enters the flat, using the key from the raincoat, telephones the prison and asks that Margot be released. Margot, who does not understand why she has been released, goes home, and finds that the key in her handbag does not fit the lock. Hubbard waits some time, he wants to find out whether she knows the hiding place under the stair carpet. She does not, so that clears her of any suspicion. The inspector opens the door for her. Hubbard tells a colleague to take the handbag back to the police station. Hubbard and Margot then wait for Tony's homecoming.When Tony comes home he realizes that he cannot get inside: he is wearing Hubbard's raincoat with Hubbard's key. Hubbard and Margot, along with Mark, hide themselves inside and do not open the door. Then Tony remembers that he had been told to collect Margot's belongings from the police station, so he goes there to fetch her handbag, with the key. When he comes home he finds that the key from Margot's handbag - actually Swann's - does not fit into the lock. Tony starts thinking what could have happened. When he takes the key from under the stair carpet he gives himself away.Tony enters the room to find Margot and the inspector, and Mark too. He realizes he's been found out and congratulates the inspector. After appearing surprised that he has finally been found out, Tony then offers everyone a drink, acting very casual, as tears begin to stream down his wife's face. The last scene is of the inspector, acting in a manner that shows he's proud of himself, as he combs his mustache as he makes a phone call to inform Scotland Yard that they have caught Tony."
tt0046931,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'FilmNoir']","On Saturday April 9, 1954, Miller Starkey, a small-time hood who works for West Coast mob second-in-command Max Edward Troy, is palling with Troy in a field when he sees hitman Chester Davitt appear over a nearby hill, sawed-off shotgun in hand. Starkey turns but is pushed by Troy and is promptly shot by Davitt.Sgt. Joe Friday, working out of the LAPD's Intelligence Division, gets information on the killing from forensic scientist Ray Pinker as Pinker briefs division chief James Hamilton and other officers. Hamilton suspects Troy and several of his close associates, such as Lee Reinhardt, Wesley Cannon, and Davitt, and after a meeting with chief of police W. H. Parker the detectives arrest Troy and his associates and a low floor of the Crown Regent Hotel is appropriated by the police to allow mass-interrogation. Davitt cannot be found but his wife Belle is brought in and angrilly calls out Friday and company, to no avail.Friday and his partner Frank Smith interrogate Max Troy, but after four hours they get nothing out of him. As he is taken to jail they get word that an eyewitness has been found. It is a museum curator named Jesse Quinn, who positively identifies Chester Davitt as being near the field at the time of the crime.Friday and Smith check out The Red Spot Grille, a restaurant secretly owned by Troy, and find nothing. They then decide to infiltrate a policewoman, Grace Downing, into the bar with a primitive wire to record conversation between Troy and his pals. After 36 hours habeus corpus kicks in and despite the reluctance of Deputy DA Adolph Alexander, Troy and his pals are released. Friday and Smith, however, get information from Roy Cleaver, an informant and jazz musician; he tells them that Starkey was seen weeks before his death sporting heavy bandaging from a beating. When Friday and Smith question Starkey's widow, she tearfully confirms this and gives Friday a copy of her husband's work book, a collection of gambling debtors.Friday and Smith question 22 of the names in the book but get no information until they question theatrical agent Fabian Gerard, who explains that he paid back a gambling debt but was confronted by other mob enforcers claiming he didn't; when he showed them proof they left him alone.Now the two officers figure out why Starkey was killed - he'd been pocketing debts he'd been collecting. They learn more from one of Grace Downing's recordings - Troy tells the bartender to take a package in his car's glove box and dispose of it; the bartender loaned the car to his nephew for a fishing trip and it won't be back until Wednesday, and he'll get rid of whatever this package is then.The police, however, find and arrest Chester Davitt, and a grand jury is summoned to investigate Troy and his pals. Friday goes to get Jesse Quinn, but Quinn suddenly gets cold feet about testifying; he is supoendaed but tells the grand jury nothing substantial. The jury members question Friday in their investigation, and in the end the jury votes not to indict Troy.Captain Hamilton angrilly orders Friday and Smith to tail Troy day and night, and they do, constantly searching him wherever he goes. It goes too far when they tail him to a gin game and several toughs attack Friday and Smith; the two policemen win the ensuing brawl but get a mild reprimand from Hamilton for it.More pressing is a call from Grace Downing that she found something from the bartender's car at The Red Spot, but that Troy may be on to her. Friday and Smith arrive at the bar and escort her safely out, then she takes them to the back alley where they find a box of shotgun shells - with four missing.Eventually a wiretap is installed at The Red Spot, and one of Troy's pals, Wesley Cannon, gets a call from Cleveland, and informs the bartender that Chester Davitt has been killed to keep him quiet - permanently - about the Starkey murder. Friday and Smith reluctantly confront Belle Davitt with the resulting tape, and she tearfully changes her tune, showing the officers the toolbox where Troy and Chester sawed off the shotgun barrel, and she reveals that the gun was thrown into Echo Park Lake.With a signed affidavit from Belle Davitt and the resulting evidence, DA Alexander has enough to convict Troy, but Troy pulls the ultimate fast one that ensures he'll never be arrested."
tt0046949,"['Biography', 'Drama', 'History']","Based on the novel by Mika Waltari, Sinuhe the Egyptian, the film takes place during the reign on Akhnaton (around 1352 B.C.). The story, told in flashback, begins with an abandoned infant found in a reed basket on the Nile who is taken into the home of a talented physician, Senmut (Carl Benton Reid). Named Sinuhe, he grows into an idealistic young man. First he wants to become a soldier, but then his father talks him out of it, and Sinuhe undertakes studies to become a physician, just like his foster father.Sinuhe (Edmund Purdom) becomes best friends with the energetic and extroverted Horemheb (Victor Mature), who is training for the army at the same school run by the priests. Very different in character, the two friends go on an excursion hunting lions in the desert. They save the life of a strange lone man who they find worshiping a carved image of the sun. Unbeknownst to them, he is actually the new young Pharaoh Akhnaton (Michael Wilding), who is introducing a far less war-like type of rule into Egypt based on the worship of one god, the Aten.Akhnaton makes Sinuhe personal physician to the royal family and Horemheb a commander in his army. Enjoying the good life, Horemheb one night takes Sinuhe to the home of an infamous Babylonian courtesan Nefer (Bella Darvi), with whom Sinuhe becomes instantly infatuated. Nefer, however, only plays with men, and before too long, Sinuhe has sacrificed everything for her, only to be then cruelly rejected when she is tired of playing with him. Kaptah (Peter Ustinov) used to be a slave of Sinuhe's foster family, but he insisted in remaining with him, instead of going with Nefer. Kaptah and Sinuhe will remain in contact throughout the years, although they have a strange relationship based on equality; Kaptah will become a free man, a bar patron, and later, quite a rich merchant, with the help of Sinuhe, his initial investment, and his connections.Having neglected his duties, Sinuhe is a marked man and flees Egypt, spending many years in foreign countries practicing his medical genius. When he returns home, however, Egypt has slipped into serious trouble, as Akhnaton has lost the respect of the military, and his new religion is dividing the country. The fact that Queen Nefertiti (Anitra Stevens) has only been able to give birth to daughters is not helping either, but there may be other wives or a concubine who will finally succeed in having the heir the country needs so badly.Sinuhe finds Horemheb is plotting against the Pharaoh with the ambitious Princess Baketamon (Gene Tierney). In the rebellion that follows, Merit (Jean Simmons), who had always been a good friend of Sinuhe--and who may even be falling in love with him (and him with her)--is killed when Akhnaton's temple is sacked, and Sinuhe loses his young son Thoth (Tommy Rettig). When it is revealed he is actually the Pharoah's half brother, Sinuhe finally realizes how he has compromised all of his principles, and leaves to start a lonely existence on his own in the desert, bereft of family or love."

Troubling her, however, is the fact that John's father Tom deliberately built the mansion across the path long taken by elephants on their way to the river and constructed a wall to keep them at bay. John's violent hatred of one particular bull elephant surprises Ruth, and she is also startled to learn that Tom is buried in a lavish marble grave behind the house, while John's mother is buried in England, because, according to Appuhamy, she hated Ceylon.Soon after his return, John's friends, fellow English planters and his American overseer, Dick Carver, drop by the house to meet Ruth. The men welcome Ruth, the only white woman in the area, then proceed to get drunk while toasting the greatness of John's father. Dick, who is leaving for Paris the next day, assures Ruth that Tom was more vain than heroic and counsels her not to take his legacy too seriously.Later, Ruth is awakened in the middle of the night by the sound of John and his friends playing polo on bicycles across the mansion's spacious floors. When Ruth tells John she was frightened by the noise, he coldly dismisses her fears as childish. Ruth runs crying back to her bedroom, and suddenly shamed, John follows and apologizes.The next day, Ruth notices Appuhamy praying at the foot of Tom's grave and tours the enormous kitchen with him. Appuhamy shows Ruth the items that were special favorites of ""the old master,"" which are still being purchased, and balks when she offers to plan the menu so as to reduce the amount of waste generated by the plantation. Appuhamy also refuses to give Ruth the key to Tom's old study, piquing Ruth's curiosity.That night, Dick stops by to say farewell and, before going, encourages Ruth to contact him if she needs help. Later, John fractures his leg while drunkenly playing bicycle polo and is confined to his bed. During his convalescence, Ruth tries to sneak into Tom's study but hides when Appuhamy appears. After overhearing Appuhamy declare to a portrait of Tom that Ruth ""does not belong"" at Elephant Walk, Ruth learns from John's doctor that John's belligerent attitudes are impeding his recovery. Ruth writes to Dick for help, and he quickly returns and resumes his work as overseer.John's mood does not improve, however, as the expected monsoons have not started and the elephants have become agitated over the lack of water. When John yells at her for changing his lunch menu without permission, Ruth rushes to Dick, and while out riding with him, confesses that John is still ruled by his dead father. Dick kisses Ruth, who, despite her attraction, pulls away, protesting that she still loves John. Back at the plantation, John apologizes to Ruth and tries to appease her by announcing a special upcoming celebration.The celebration turns out to be an elaborate birthday party for Tom, and Ruth finally explodes with frustration, ordering John's drunken friends out of the house. The next morning, John condemns Ruth for driving his friends away and, when she insists that he hates Tom as much as she does, slaps her. Stunned, Ruth runs to Dick's quarters and begs him to take her to Paris. At the same time, however, one of John's servants collapses with cholera and the plantation is placed under quarantine.Trapped at Elephant Walk, Ruth and Dick toil long hours to help John curb the epidemic and soothe the terrified workers. When John, who is aware of Ruth's plans to leave him, insists on burying the dead himself, Ruth is impressed by his selfless dedication. Later, after the quarantine is lifted, Ruth tells Dick that she cannot leave John before the rains come, despite Dick's protests that John has not changed.As a final precaution, the workers' huts are set ablaze, and the elephants, agitated by the fire, start to stampede. With no workers available to beat them back, the elephants crash through the plantation wall and storm the house. Appuhamy, who has finally recognized Ruth's true worth, rushes to alert her and is killed by an angry elephant. While crashing through the house, the elephants cause a fire to erupt, and John barely arrives in time to rescue Ruth. Just then, the rain starts, and as Elephant Walk burns to the ground, John and Ruth embrace and pledge to start a new life together."

With them is one of Steigel's executives, George Nyle Caswell (Louis Calhern), who is a member of Tredway's board. Bullard then rides the elevator to the ground floor, where he sends a wire to his company headquarters in Millburgh, PA, calling an executive-committee meeting. Finally he steps out onto Wall Street, tries to hail a taxi, collapses, and dies.Caswell is arguing with Steigel about the wisdom of Bullard's ""one-man"" governance of Tredway when he overhears a police whistle, looks down from the office window, and sees Bullard's body being lifted into an ambulance. Immediately he calls his stockbroker and orders him to start selling Tredway common stock short. He confidently predicts that Tredway stock will sink when ""The Street"" heard of Bullard's death. Steigel, shell-shocked, expresses his disapproval of Caswell's ""sure thing.""Back at the Tredway Tower, Bullard's secretary, Erica Martin (Nina Foch), receives the telegram and starts making the rounds of the Executive Suite to notify the five Vice-Presidents of the meeting. She finds Frederick Y. Alderson (Walter Pidgeon), the treasurer, in his office; Alderson asks whether Bullard said anything else in the telegram, and Miss Martin says no. She finds that Jesse Q. Grimm (Dean Jagger), VP for Manufacturing, has already left for the weekend, and instructs his secretary to call the tolltakers on the Pennsylvania Turnpike if she has to, to get him back to the office. Loren P. Shaw (Fredric March), the controller, is in his office, dictating a memo to Bullard critical of the money that McDonald Walling (William Holden) is spending on his experiments, when Miss Martin informs him of the meeting. He imperiously asks what other information he ought to bring, and Miss Martin clearly resents his probing questions. She goes on to deliver the message to J. Walter Dudley (Paul Douglas), VP for Sales, and Dudley's secretary Eva Bardeman (Shelley Winters) says that he is ""in the phone."" Miss Martin tells Eva to deliver the message, and Eva does--after Dudley has finished yet another angry conversation on the phone with his wife. Finally, she has to call Don Walling at the Pike Street furniture-making plant, where he is about to supervise another experiment. Chagrined, Walling assures Miss Martin that he will attend the meeting, and tells his chief design assistant to run the experiment without him.Back in New York, Steigel is teasing Caswell about his uncertainty about Bullard's death--because unknown to both men, a thief stole Bullard's wallet out of his dead hand, removed the cash, and stuffed the wallet into a trash can before the police could notice it. All the police have, therefore, is a body without identification and wearing clothes custom-monogrammed with the initials ""A.B."" Caswell has sold 3,700 shares of stock short, and if Bullard turns out not to be dead, he is ruined. Caswell reads every paper he can get his hands on, and none report the death. At the Stork Club, he calls the hospital, but they refuse to give out any information on privacy grounds. He places a call to Bullard, and is told that Bullard is expected within twenty minutes. He then makes another call, as his wife impatiently chides him about keeping her waiting.In Millburgh, the five Vice Presidents have gathered for the meeting, and while Don Walling tries to run his experiment from a distance, Dudley boasts about losing a golf game in order to make a sale. Shaw comes in and finds that everyone else is as mystified about the meeting as is he. Six o'clock comes and goes--and no Bullard.Miss Martin announces that Bullard has missed his train, and then privately informs Alderson that Julia Tredway (Barbara Stanwyck) is in Bullard's office. Alderson talks to Miss Tredway, who reveals that George Caswell has inquired on behalf of an unnamed friend as to whether he can purchase 3,700 shares of stock at the price at which it closed for the day. An outraged Alderson tells Miss Martin that he must see Bullard at once when he comes in--but Miss Martin says that Bullard missed the next train as well, and hasn't even check out of the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.Back in New York, Caswell has finally seen an item in a late paper saying that a man having the initials ""A.B."" has dropped dead in front of an office building on Wall Street. Caswell tells the maitre d' to cancel that last call he placed to Millburgh (just as Julia Tredway is calling him back), then telephones the police and orders a magnum of champagne.In Millburgh, Fred Alderson goes home, where he has dinner guests waiting. Shaw drops Dudley off at the airport--and then watches as Dudley does not get onto a plane, but instead is picked up by none other than Eva. Shaw does not follow, but merely takes note.Don Walling returns to Pike Street and finds that the experiment has failed. His wife Mary (June Allyson) drives him home and tries to console him--but the two then get into an argument over the question of whether Avery Bullard has in fact betrayed Walling, whom he recruited into Tredway, saying, ""Design what you want, build what you want""--only to let him twist in the wind as Shaw constantly interfered with his experiments, saying that they cost too much. Jesse Grimm takes note of Walling's early departure from the plant, and bitterly comments that he didn't need any ""wonder boys"" to tell him how to build the plant in the first place.In the city room of Millburgh's daily newspaper, reporters ask for prior file photos of Bullard, and of Julia Tredway, taken on the day that Miss Tredway's father jumped from a window of the Tower. They also discuss the legal wisdom of reporting what they know of the extramarital dalliance between Miss Tredway and Bullard.When Don Walling returns home, he takes a call from a newspaper reporter asking him for ""a statement"" in light of the death of Avery Bullard. Don, heartsick, rushes to Fred Alderson's house. Fred has heard the news, too, on the radio, and goes with Don back to the Tower. To their chagrin, they find Shaw already in the Tower, issuing press releases and authorizing the immediate release of the company's quarterly earnings report, which will show high earnings. Alderson loses his temper with Shaw over the proposed funeral arrangements. Shaw protests to Don that Alderson has accused him unfairly; Don cooly brushes Shaw off. Alderson confesses that he ""made a mess"" of his encounter, and realizes that Bullard never wanted him as a successor--but is determined that that successor will *not* be Shaw.Alone in her home, Julia Tredway takes a call, confirms her identity--and then silently hangs up the phone.Don Walling goes back home and tells his wife that the next President will likely be Jesse Grimm--and that Fred Alderson had proposed that Don himself seek the presidency, but Don had turned him down. Mary suggests that Don resign from Tredway and seek an opportunity elsewhere, but Don won't turn his back on the company or the town until he knows the situation is untenable.Shaw goes directly to Eva Bardeman's apartment, where, not to his surprise, he finds Dudley. He informs them both that Bullard is dead and that the entire Board of Directors will have a special meeting next evening at six o'clock. Shaw then orders Dudley to take the business flight he was supposed to take to Chicago, stay there until he can fly back just before the meeting, and not take any calls from Millburgh--and that Dudley's wife need not know of his dalliance with his secretary.Don Walling is playing catch with his son Mike (Tim Considine), who is preparing for a big Little League game, when his chief design aide calls him from Pike Street to tell him that the failed experiment might be workable after all. Don rushes to the plant, where he hears that Shaw has suspended all work except production work. The factory foreman complains to Don that instead of making the fine furniture for which Tredway is famous, now they make cheap cookie-cutter furniture of the type Bullard himself once condemned as ""not good enough."" Other employees at the plant express their fear that Tredway might see the same kinds of closures it saw during the Depression.George Caswell is very much alarmed at the earnings report, and demands an immediate meeting with Shaw. He travels to Millburgh and demands from Shaw the right to buy 4,000 shares of stock from the company reserve at Friday's close. Shaw asks, ""Why the extra three hundred?"" and confirms that he knows about the short sale. Caswell confesses that if he tries to cover the short sale on the open market, he will go personally bankrupt. As the two are arguing, Shaw gets a call from Julia Tredway. We hear only Shaw's side of the conversation, but it is enough to show that Julia Tredway wants complete information on all her holdings of Tredway stock. Afterward, Caswell demands his 3,700 shares as the price of his vote in the upcoming board meeting, to elect Shaw the next President of Tredway. Shaw agrees to the bargain, but as soon as Caswell leaves, Shaw asks his secretary to assemble some information on Caswell, including information about Caswell's earlier run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission.At the Little League game, Fred Alderson reveals that he finally got in touch with Jesse, who refuses to consider being President, as he wants to retire. Fred then proposes Dudley. Don swallows his gorge and agrees--but then, shortly after he resumes his seat in the bleachers, he rebels against the prospect. He rushes to the airport and tells Fred that Dudley must not become President, as he would be too weak. Don then proposes himself. Though Fred tells him that Jesse won't accept Don, Don tells Fred to talk to Jesse anyway, while he, Don, will talk to Julia Tredway. Fred agrees, when he realizes that Don is actually talking like a commander, an attitude Fred respects. But as Dudley gets off the plane, he refuses to talk to Fred, and then accepts a summons to meet Shaw at a downtown eating club. Before he leaves the airport, a tearful Eva Bardeman tells Dudley that their relationship is through, because Dudley ""never faced an unpleasant situation in [his] life.""Don rushes home, where his son tries to tell him about the game, but he doesn't have time. He announces his intention to run for President of Tredway, and asks Mary to forward to him any messages from Fred. As Don leaves, Fred does call and asks Mary to have Don hold up all proceedings of the board meeting until Fred arrives. Mary says that she will give Don the message, but then declines to do so.At the Tower, Don arrives and finds Julia Tredway in Bullard's office, burning all of her stock certificates and saying that she is selling out completely. Don loses his temper and asks why she won't do her own dirty work instead of giving a proxy to Shaw. Julia throws him out of the office and almost jumps from the office window herself, stopped only by the loud chiming of the tower clock.Don finds Caswell already in the boardroom, making a cryptic reference to an early bird failing to catch 3,700 wriggling worms--a reference Don does not catch. Shortly thereafter, Shaw and Dudley arrive, with Miss Martin, who will take minutes. Dudley is about to nominate Shaw, when Julia enters the boardroom, tears up Shaw's proxy, and says, ""I'll do it myself."" Then Dudley nominates Shaw, Caswell seconds, and Don cannot stop the board from voting. But the vote is only three to one for Shaw, with one abstention--and under company by-laws, it takes four votes to elect, not a majority of members present and voting.Don apologizes to Julia for his earlier outburst--while Caswell takes Shaw aside and admits that he had cast the abstaining vote. He demands written assurance that the 3,700 shares will be his; Shaw shows him a letter of transfer already made out and ready to sign when he becomes President. Thus assured, Caswell returns to the boardroom, with Shaw in tow.In the meantime, Mary Walling has rushed to the tower to confess to Don that she held up Fred's message. Don forgives her for the deception and assures her that he can still win. So as the meeting reconvenes, Don protests that the board has gotten too used to quick decisions. Shaw takes the bait and makes what amounts to a campaign speech, based solely on his achievements as controller in saving the company money. While he is doing this, Fred and Jesse arrive, but Fred admits to Don that Jesse is stubborn in his refusal to vote for Don.Nevertheless, Don forges ahead, emboldened by Fred's exasperated protest against Shaw's penny-pinching methods. Then Don lays out his vision of what sort of leadership the company ought to have, and finally admits something that he himself has only now realized: that Avery Bullard had lost his way, and was wrong to emphasize money alone as the reason-for-being of the company. He concludes by smashing a flimsy table, a product of Tredway's KF line, and shouting that the Tredway image has been debased by the sale of ""junk"" to raise dividends. He offers his own vision of a new product line, one that the company and everyone in it will be proud to make and offer, and of a philosophy of standing for quality and introducing new products to meet people's ever-changing needs. His speech concluded, he receives the enthusiastic endorsement of Fred, Dudley, and Jesse. Julia Tredway adds her endorsement, Shaw simply nods, and Caswell dares not utter a word. And so Don Walling is unanimously elected President of Tredway.Shaw manfully congratulates Don. Caswell asks Shaw about his stock, and Shaw replies by tearing up the letter of transfer and stuffing the shards of it into Caswell's breast pocket. As the board members file out, Julia Tredway notices Mary Walling waiting outside, and offers Mary some advice about not being able to understand a man like Don--or like Avery Bullard. Julia asks Mary to thank Don for saving her (Julia's) life. As Don comes out, Mary embraces him. Don asks Miss Martin to call an executive-committee meeting for ten o'clock Monday morning, to select an Executive VP--and then finally asks after the Little League game, which Mary assures him that his son's team won."

Next morning Hideto Ogato (Akira Takarada) receives a phone call. Being a salvage expert the coast guard wants him to report immediately as a result of the sinking.A situation room is set up to investigate the sinking of the Eiko Maru. Its last position is known but the cause of the sinking is still a mystery, though an explosion is suspected. A rescue vessel ""Bingo Maru"" approaches the location of the sinking. Again a flash of light erupts out of the water and the Bingo Maru suffers the same fate as the Eiko Maru.The Coast Guard assures frantic families of the crews of the two ships, that everything is being done including more ships and helicopters committed to the search. Finally there are results as three survivors are found in the water. At the same time reports of the sinking of a fishing boat brings the total of lost ships to three.On Odo island, the port of the missing fishing boat, inhabitants are scanning the sea looking for signs of the boat. A raft is seen with Masaji Sieji (Ren Yamamoto) who lives on the island on board. The islanders pull the raft in Masajis says ""A monster did it"" And passes out close to death.Days later other fishing boats return to the island, complaining their nets are all empty. One of the elders claims it is Godzilla eating the fish. Other members of the village laugh at his quaint ways. The same day a helicopter lands on the island carrying a group of press and military - they interview Masajis who again claims it was a monster. The elder gets their attention and tells the legend of Godzilla. He then explains the history of sacrifices the island used to make to keep Godzilla happy. Now all that is left is the religious ceremony.During the night a typhoon hits the island. The islanders take shelter but along with the normal noise of such storms they can hear something huge moving around. The next morning 12 houses are found to have been destroyed during the night and at least 9 people have died. Discussions between the mayor and eyewitnesses uncover the fact that the destruction of the houses was unusual, and not caused by the storm.Professor Kyohei Yamane suggests a scientific task force go to the island to investigate the situation. As the vessel leaves, a number of passengers are surprised to see the reclusive Dr Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata) at the dock to see the expedition off.At the island the team gets to work, first they detect radiation around the ruined buildings and in the water wells. A series of huge shallow depressions are measured. It becomes apparent the depressions are giant foot prints. In one of the depressions they find a trilobite - a creature extinct for millions of years.On the other side of the island an alarm sounds, loud rhythmic thunder can be heard approaching. Many realize it is the same sound heard during the storm. The villagers start to climb the island's central ridge to see what is going on.A huge reptilian rears up and roars at the villagers and disappears. The villages continue towards the creature only to see it disappear into the ocean leaving a series of tracks along a beach.At a meeting convened to discuss the expeditions findings, Professor Yamane surmises Godzilla is a relic from the age of dinosaurs and has been disturbed by recent hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific. He displays the trilobite and the radioactive sand found on the island as proof of his argument. Newspaper reports claim that up to 17 ships have been lost because of Godzilla. A special agency is set up to look into ways to counter the creature before all international trade is stopped with Japan. The Japanese navy goes into action depth charging any areas Godzilla was last seen. In Tokyo Bay a pleasure boat full of party goers sees Godzilla, rather than attack the boat, the creature seems intent on heading for shore. Professor Yammi struggles with the situation. He understands Godzilla needs to be destroyed but feels the creature deserves to live. After all it was man who disturbed and created the creature. He wants to understand what caused things to turn out the way it did.Orgata speaks to the professor Yammi's daughter and asks her to try and talk to talk to Professor Serizawa who is rumored to have a device that could destroy Godzilla. Newspaperman Hagiwara (Sachio Sakai) asks if he can come along to get a better idea of the true story.Serizawa is puzzled at the reporters questions. He denies such a weapon exists, but refuses to say what he is really working on. Emiko waits for the reporter go then presses Serizawa for more information, he relents and shows her what he is doing, but she has to be sworn to secrecy first. In the lab Serizawa shows her a process that turns a tank full of fish to skeletons in mere seconds.Emiko is shocked but validates her promise to Serizawa by not saying anything to Orgata when she returns home. Outside the house sirens sound, and the trade mark thundering steps can be heard in the distance. Godzilla nears the shore and the army opens fire with all the heavy weapons they can muster. Ignoring the armys efforts Godzilla comes ashore destroys a train, then moves into the downtown area. After a protracted battle with the army, the monster destroys a major bridge before heading back to sea.Next morning newspapers are full of images and stories of the attack. It is noted that scientists from all over the world have begun flying in to help defeat the creature. Quickly it is decided to evacuate the coastal areas around Tokyo Bay. Once this is completed an electrified barrier is to be built. Its hoped that by repeated electrocution Godzilla will be turned away and forced back to sea permanently.Now that a plan of action is in place Orgata decides now is a good time to ask Professor Yammi for his daughter Emikos hand in marriage. Yammi is completely uninterested in the advance. He is consumed with questions about Godzilla. Frustrated Orgata starts debating Yammi, ultimately Yammi throws him out of the house dashing Emikos hopes.At nightfall Godzilla is again seen heading for the shoreline. The newly installed electrical barrier is charged and the army takes up position with heavy artillery and tanks. As Godzilla pauses at the barrier the army sees its chance again attacks. Godzilla responds by setting huge fires across the city with its to date unseen radioactive breath.Realizing their plan has failed the authorities initiate code 129 This means rather than fight Godzilla they are only going to concentrate on getting civilians out of harms way. As the plan takes affect a wing of Japanese fighter craft try to distract the creature. Unexpectedly the attack seems to work and Godzilla retreats back to the waters of Tokyo Bay.Rescue efforts switch to high gear, but the sheer numbers of wounded, many suffering radiation sickness completely overwhelm hospitals. Despite their best effort the government knows there is little hope for survivors.Seeing the carnage Emiko confesses to Orgata what she really saw in the Professors lab There really is a way to destroy the creature. She goes on to describe how Serizawa dropped a device into a tank of fish, seconds later all the fish were just skeletons. Serizawa explains how the device sucks all oxygen from water causing any living creature caught by the process to liquefy instantly. Hearing this Orgata and Emiko agree to confront the Serizawa and convince him to use his discovery. Serizawa counters that to reveal the weapon to the world would unleash a force greater than even the atomic bomb. The only difference is the oxygen destroyer could ultimately kill all mankind.Serizawa is concerned that once the he uses the weapon the genie is out of the bottle and he does not know if he can get it back in. Serizawa is torn by his choice, but he cannot see any way to resolve it. He catches a sight from the TV of people all over the country praying that Godzilla wont return. He realizes he must act and deploy the weapon.With a new sense of purpose he begins to destroy data and equipment in his lab notes. At sea a ship with Orgato and Serizawa aboard a ship mounted with Geiger counters locates Godzilla. Orgata prepares to make the dive to deploy the weapon. Serizawa insists he goes with him. They only have one chance and one weapon, so it has to be done properly. Reaching the ocean floor they find Godzilla resting and begin the work to deploy the weapon. Serizawa unexpectedly signals Orgata to return to the surface. Reaching the surface alone Orgato realizes he has been fooled and Serizawas solution was to die deploying the weapon.With one final message Serizawa tells Orgata that the weapon worked and he hopes he and Emiko with be happy together. The weapons effect envelopes Godzilla. The creature struggles for a time before sinking to the bottom uttering one final defiant roar. Moments later nothing remains but a skeleton. Within minutes this is gone tooOnboard the ship Professor Yammi considers the concept that there must be more Godzillas out in the depths of the ocean. If man continues his experiments with atomic weapons, chances are extremely high another Godzilla will return to once again threaten our civilization."

tt0047162,"['Drama', 'Romance']","Paris, France.After the success of his first book, famous American writer Charles Wills (Van Johnson) returns to Paris, and visits a local cafe named Caf√© Dhingo where he chats with the bartender about his life. Charles flashes back to his past....August 1944.Shortly after the liberation of Paris from the Nazis, Charles, a sergeant in the US Army and reporter for the Stars and Stripes, was on the streets of Paris, covering the liberation celebration. He was suddenly grabbed by the most beautiful brunette woman he ever saw, she kissed him on the lips and disappeared into the crowd.Charles followed the crowd to Caf√© Dhingo and met another pretty woman named Marion Ellswirth (Donna Reed). The mutual attraction was instant, and he was invited to join the party her father was throwing in celebration of the liberation of Paris and the impending end of the war. Charles, Marion, and her persistent French suitor Claude Matine (George Dolenz) arrived at the Ellswirth household, only to find that the woman who kissed Charles was Marion's younger sister Helen (Elizabeth Taylor).During drinks, Charles learned that Marion and Helen's father, James Ellswirth (Walter Pidgeon), came out of World War I alive and promptly joined the drifter generation. Unlike most drifters, he never grew out of it; even went as far as raising his two daughters to desire such lifestyle. Helen took after her father and used her beauty to sustain a life of luxury even though James was flat broke. Marion went the other way, and looked for serious-minded and conventional young men such as Claude the aspiring prosecutor and Charles the future novelist.Over the next few months, Charles and Helen fell in love and started dating. After Helen recovered from a near-death case of pneumonia from being out in the rain during that winter, they got married and settled in Paris in the spring of 1945 after news that World War II has ended for good. James had hoped that Helen would marry rich, but having taken a liking to Charles, he joined the happy family of Charles. Helen eventually got pregnant and gave birth to a daughter in 1946, whom they name Vickie. Marion, having lost Charles to Helen, agreed to marry Claude around the same time.Charles struggles to make ends meet with his meager journalist salary while he worked on his novels as well as look after Vickie, while Helen and Grandpa James partied on. Then one day luck struck.James had bought a few large pieces of land in Texas, convinced that he would become an oil baron. The oil never came and the deeds became a family joke. Always ready with practical jokes, he gave those deeds to Charles as Helen's dowry.Five years later in 1951, the joke turned into gold as oil began to shoot up from these lands non-stop. Charles quit his job, and Helen and James began to host parties instead of going to them.Over the next year, the relief of financial strain and the influx of wealth suddenly brought out the irresponsible side of Charles, as he could no longer deal with the disappointment of his manuscripts getting rejected by publishers. And unexpectedly, this brought out the responsible side of Helen. Now it was Helen who wished to stay home to raise their daughter Vickie, while Charles partied his wealth away.They also each took on other interests: Helen started to flirt with handsome English tennis player named Paul Lane (Roger Moore). Charles asked professional divorcee Lorraine Quarl (Eva Gabor) to join him as he competed in a local Paris-to-Monte Carlo race.After the race, Charles returned to Paris to patch things up with Helen, only to find her sitting in Caf√© Dhingo with Paul. A fight broke out between Paul and Charles, an angry Charles went home first and bolted the door and then passed out after drinking too much whiskey. Helen ended up having to walk all way to Marion's place in the falling snow and rain. She caught pneumonia again and this time... she didn't make it. Charles hears about her hospitalization the next day and races to the hospital to be at her side when she dies.After Helen's funeral, Marion petitioned for and got full custody of Vickie.

tt0047279,"['Adventure', 'Crime', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","This cold war film begins with a beautiful and affective montage of recently divided (though not yet wall-bifurcated) Berlin. The story proper gets going as a young GI is kidnapped by the East Germans (released in 1954, it's way too early for mention of anything called the KGB or Stasi). The initial dramatic conflict is between a U.S. military officer (Gregory Peck), who realizes that getting the kid out will be a delicate operation indeed, and said kid's blunderbuss father (Broderick Crawford), who immediately flies to Germany desiring a quick extraction, arguing for either a commando raid or a cash payoff. (Some similarity here to the last few episodes of TV's ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip."") Anyway, Crawford's character is an industrialist of some importance. So, Crawford assumes upon his arrival in Berlin that he can take charge of the situation, and marches straight into Peck's office with nary a word to the secretary or the two American officers standing outside the door. They don't stop him; they know Peck is expecting him. One of the officers says to the other, ""How does he have all this influence?"" ""He plays golf,"" says the other.
""Oh.""
Eventually Peck gets Crawford to cool his jets, largely by letting him witness a demonstration of the spy game's high tensions. When two elderly agents suspect that their cover is blown, they attempt suicide rather than be taken back to the East.
Now another problem arises for Peck-- his ear in the East is a female (""Hoffy,"" played by one Anita Bjork) with whom he naturally has a romantic involvement, but who, it turns out, he cannot trust. Thankfully for the Yanks, Peck finds out about her treachery without revealing that he's on to her, and through a subtle double-cross gets her to effect a prisoner swap, which naturally doesn't take place the way he initially described it to her (and through her to her Comintern bosses). (This all takes place in and around a military hospital that has cool, old-style Berlin, dumb-waiter style perpetually moving elevators, that we won't see again, far as I know, until the film version of Len Deighton's ""The Ipcress File,"" starring Michael Caine.)
So, naturally the would-be swap winds up with the GI back on capitalist soil, the commies empty-handed, and the dissimulating female shattered and exposed, deprived of both Peck's love and her personal freedom (that's to say, she is taken off to jail). And Broderick Crawford finds out that a son's love is far more important than golf."
tt0047296,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) once dreamed of being a great prize fighter, but now works at the docks of Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) , the corrupt boss of the longshoremen's union. He witnesses a murder by a couple of Johnny's thugs, but won't betray Friendly, who is both his brother's (Rod Steiger) boss and a long-time friend of his family.What he sees at the docks repulses Terry. In an economically depressed environment in which many are out of work, more gather by the docks each morning hoping to secure work for that day than can be hired, placing Johnny Friendly and his forces in a position to exploit them. Those who complain of the working conditions or wages one day don't work the next day, or are placed in harm's way. Consequently, most tolerate being abused.After befriending both the sister (Eva Marie Saint) of the murdered man and the local priest (Karle Malden), Terry gradually becomes a man of deeper morality, and starts to speak of acts against Friendly, who will soon go on trial. Terry finds his breaking point when his brother is murdered by Friendly's thugs, and causes him to entertain thoughts of testifying against Friendly. Still, he struggles to find the courage to do so, until the priest persuades him to.Once he betrays Friendly, Terry is without the work that always came his way when he and his brother were trusted and valued associates. Still, he confronts Friendly by the docks and when all the dock workers are witness to the brutal beating of Terry by Friendly, they refuse to work unless Terry is also allowed to work. This is the catalyst for a new tone of understanding between the workers and the dock bosses.Terry had neither wanted nor intended to be a hero, but, as a man of principle, he had become not only a hero, but a symbol of the workers' intolerance of exploitation by the dock bosses.===================================Terry Malloy, a former boxer, works as a stevedore on the urban waterfront near New York City. When the story opens, he's leaving the office/shack of Johnny Friendly, the head of the local dockworker's union. Johnny tells Terry ""You take it from here, Slugger."" Terry goes to the tenement of Joey Doyle, another dock worker and calls him out, saying that he recovered one of Joey's carrier pigeons. Joey cautiously accepts and tells Terry to meet him on the roof of the tenement. Terry looks up and sees two shady men waiting on the roof.Terry goes to Friendly's bar and stands outside with his brother, Charley and two of Friendly's enforcers, Truck and Tillio. Charley asks him if Doyle went to the roof -- referring to him as ""The Pigeon"" -- and Terry tells him he did. A moment later, a scream is heard and Joey falls from the roof. Though everyone seems to accept that Joey simply slipped and fell, everyone also knows that he was murdered on orders from Friendly because Doyle had planned to testify to the Waterfront Crime Commission about unsafe and unfair working conditions in Friendly's local union. Terry himself seems upset that a nice kid like Joey, who was well-liked in the neighborhood, would be killed by Johnny's men when he believed they would simply intimidate him into forgetting about his testimony. Truck and Tillio laugh over Doyle's death, calling him a ""canary"" (slang for an informant who would betray the union.)In the bar, Terry is still upset. One of Friendly's cronies, Skins, drops by with money for Johnny from a payoff and, when the money is counted, he comes up short. Johnny viciously searches the man and comes up with the missing money and forcibly throws the man out. When he sees that Terry is upset, he begins to lecture him on how violence is necessary to enforce his rules and keep everyone in line. Johnny also admits to ordering Doyle's murder. For setting Doyle up, Johnny tells his foreman, Big Mac, to give Terry a cushy job during the next day's shift at his pier.Out in the alley where Joey was thrown off the roof his sister, Edie, and Father Barry, the local Catholic priest, look over the body of Joey. Edie angrily pleads with other people in the neighborhood about why Joey, well-liked by his friends and the local kids, would be murdered. Everyone knows, but none of them want to say anything. Edie also becomes angry with Father Barry, saying he doesn't know about the violence in the area because he's too busy with running his church to actually visit the waterfront.The next day, the dockworkers gather at Johnny Friendly's pier. Big Mac runs a shape-up system where tags are given to selected men to work the ship. Edie is there, with Father Barry, who tells her that she was right; he has come down to see just how bad the situation is. Edie's father, the elderly and cranky Pop Doyle, also shows up because he needs to earn money for his son's funeral. He also gives his dead son's coat to another worker, Tim ""Kayo"" Dugan, who accepts it.While waiting for his name to be called, Terry is approached by two officials from the Waterfront Crime Commission. One of them recognizes Terry from his boxing days and asks him if he'll testify to the commission about Joey's murder and about Johnny and his associates. Terry flatly refuses. The other man tells Terry they'll subpoena him if necessary.Mac calls out the names of men who get regular work, and Terry is among them. The remaining tags are passed out at Mac's discretion; when the men who aren't chosen become angry with him, Mac throws the tags behind them and a minor riot breaks out. Pop is pushed out of the crowd by the younger men. When Edie tries to grab a tag for her father, Terry grabs it first and won't give it to Edie. When one of the other men points out to Terry that she's Joey's sister, he gives her the tag. Edie gives it to her father; Pop admonishes Father Barry for letting Edie witness the riot. The other men are disheartened and Barry tells them that no union would ever let what just occurred happen. The men explain how a ""trigger local"" works: anyone who gets out of line is either ostracized or eliminated by Johnny and his goons. They also explain that meetings among union members are impossible since Johnny has spies working everywhere. Barry suggests they all meet in the basement of his church.In the ship's hold, Terry is loafing on a pile of sacks when his brother, Charley ""The Gent"", Johnny's right-hand man, finds him and gives him a small job to do. Johnny wants Terry to be a spy during the meeting Father Barry called that night at the church. Terry is reluctant but Charley reminds him that he and Johnny have done a lot of favors for Terry. Terry agrees to go.At the church that night, Barry calls the meeting to order, noting that attendance is very low. He explains to the men what they already know: working conditions are bad and their union is powerless as long as it's run by Friendly's gang. Barry also suggests that if they can talk openly about why Joey Doyle was murdered then they'll make progress. Edie asks Joey's best friend, Jimmy, to say something, but he turns her down. Barry tells them that they only way they'll be able to make better lives for themselves is to stand up to Johnny. One of the tougher men in the crowd, Kayo Dugan, tells Barry that the rule is everyone is ""D&D"" or ""deaf and dumb"" about Johnny. Dugan also notices that Terry is sitting in one of the back pews and recognizes him as Charley's brother & a spy. Despite his attempts at coaching, Barry is unable to convince the men. As Barry's fellow priest calls the meeting to an end with a prayer, a window is suddenly smashed in and the rattling of pounding clubs is heard outside: Johnny's men have surrounded the church. Anyone who tries to escape is severely beaten. Terry takes Edie out of the church safely. Dugan, while trying to escape, is beaten bloody by Johnny's goons but is rescued by Father Barry. Barry angrily asks Dugan if he still wants to remain D&D and seems to get through to Dugan. Dugan promises to testify as long as he has Barry's support. Dugan also warns Barry that Johnny's goons won't hesitate to lean on a priest as well. Barry says he'll stay with Dugan ""Right down the line.""In the park in front of the church, Terry sees that Edie gets out of the area safely. While they talk, a homeless man confronts them, asking for money. The man recognizes both Terry and Edie. When he begins to talk about Joey's death and how Terry set him up, Terry yells at him to leave. The man does.When she gets home, Edie finds her father packing her things. Edie, a student at an upstate Catholic college, had been visiting her family. Pop tells her that she should leave the neighborhood because of the violence she's seen so far. He also tells her he knows she was with Terry Malloy and how Terry is connected to Johnny Friendly. Edie refuses to leave, driven by her need to know why her brother was killed.On the roof of his building, Terry tends to his flock of carrier pigeons. Terry talks to a couple of kids from the neighborhood, one of them is Tommy, who helps Terry with his coop, and sees Edie over at Joey's coop. Terry goes to her and they talk for a while, about how pigeons are victims of predatory birds in the city, mostly hawks. Terry offers to take Edie out for a drink at a local bar and she accepts. While they talk, she tells Terry of her interest in solving Joey's murder. Terry warns her stop snooping around too much because it could be dangerous. They dance for a while at a wedding being held in the bar when one of Johnny's men, Barney, tells him that Johnny wants to meet with him. Terry tells him he'll go when he's ready to. Terry also runs into one of the Crime Commission agents who hands him a subpoena. Terry is still steadfast and tears up the papers, refusing to ""eat cheese"" (like a rat would and become an informer).Later, Terry walks home and is stopped by Johnny and Charlie. Johnny asks Terry about the church meeting and Terry tells him it was run by Father Barry and that very little was discussed that could threaten Johnny's position. Johnny counters, telling Terry that Dugan had gone to the crime commission and gave a sworn statement about the illicit operations and corruption of Johnny's union. Johnny suggests that they use their ""muscle"" to eliminate Dugan. Johnny also feels that Terry didn't do his job fully and tells him he won't have his cushy job in the yard anymore, that he's going back to work in the ""hole"", the cargo hold of ships where the hard labor is performed. Charlie also admonishes Terry about his budding relationship with Edie Doyle, saying it's ""unhealthy"" for him to be dating the sister of the man they killed.The next day Terry is working alongside Dugan in the ship's hold, unloading crates of Irish whiskey. Terry feels the need to warn Kayo about Johnny's intentions but Kayo ignores him. As one of the pallets loaded with crates is hoisted out, the crane operator drops it on Kayo, killing him in what looks like an accident. Later, after Kayo's body has been uncovered, Father Barry gives a stirring speech to the entire workforce, telling them that Johnny and his men are using them for cheap labor and killing them when they choose to stand up for their rights. Johnny's men begin to throw rotten fruit and cans at Barry, who calmly continues to talk. One of the men, Tillio, is about to throw something when Terry stops him and punches him out. One of the men gives Joey's jacket back to Edie (she later gives it to Terry). Kayo's body is hoisted out of the hold, with Barry and Pop Doyle riding the pallet.Terry, whose conscience has been bothering him, meets with Father Barry. He tells Barry he may just testify to the Crime Commission but he doesn't want to implicate his brother or his friends. He also tells the priest that he set Joey Doyle up to be killed. Barry tells Terry that his loyalty to Charlie and Johnny is misplaced and that Johnny and Charley are merely using him, as they have all of Terry's life. He also tells Terry that a good step to take would be to tell Edie what he did. Edie had been coming to see Barry herself and Barry convinces Terry to tell her. Terry meets her and tells her, while a ship's whistle blows, making what he tells her inaudible. Edie is horrified and runs away.Terry later checks on his pigeons on his roof. He sees one of the men from the Crime Commission who approached him on the docks. Terry asks the advice of one of the boys who hangs out with him on the roof about testifying; the boy tells him it's not a good idea to get involved, especially since Terry founded the gang the kid is now a member of. The officer tries to talk to Terry and is mostly unsuccessful until he mentions the fight Terry had boxed in years before involving another man named Wilson. Terry is suddenly quite chatty with the man, hinting that he'd thrown the fight so that Charlie, Johnny and their friends could win a huge purse by betting on Wilson. Terry tells the officer straight out that he could have beaten Wilson easily and talks about his technique. Though we don't hear the rest of the conversation, it is strongly hinted that Terry may testify against Johnny.At Johnny's office, one of Johnny's spies reports that he'd seen Terry talking to the agent. Charlie tries to defend Terry, saying that Edie has Terry's emotional state mixed up. Johnny is unfazed however and orders Charlie to talk to his brother. If Terry won't ""dummy up"" then Charlie will take him to one of Johnny's hit men, Jerry G. Charlie is shocked and tries to reason with Johnny, who refuses to listen. Deeply troubled, Charlie leaves Johnny's office to find Terry.Charlie picks up Terry in a taxicab and they two have a lengthy conversation where Charlie asks Terry about his subpoena and if he plans to rat out Johnny in court. Terry still seems undecided and Charlie reminds him about all the favors he and Johnny have done for him over the years and even offers Terry a cushy job at another pier Johnny will be opening soon. When Terry seems more likely to testify, Charlie tells Terry to make up his mind before they arrive at Jerry G's place. Terry is stunned that his own brother would suggest that he'll be turned over to a hit man, Charlie pulls out a pistol and tells Terry to take the job he was offered. Charlie suddenly comes to his senses and breaks down. He recounts how Terry was once a potentially great athlete and says that Terry's manager was responsible for ruining whatever career he might have had as a boxer. Terry counters, saying that Charlie was responsible for his downfall, betting on Wilson all those years ago and destroying whatever shot Terry might have had at a prestigious boxing title and a promising career in the sport. Charlie realizes how badly he's treated his brother over the years and gives Terry the gun, telling him ""you're gonna need it."" He orders the driver to pull over and let Terry out. The driver, one of Johnny's spies, suddenly pulls into Jerry G's place nearby, where Johnny is waiting.Terry goes to Edie and Pop's apartment. Edie refuses to open the door for him and Terry breaks in, telling her she loves him. She tells him to leave and he grabs her and kisses her, Edie showing little resistance. A voice calls to Terry from the alley below, telling him his brother is there and wants to see him. Terry rushes down to the alley and begins to walk toward the voice. Edie follows, stopping momentarily to talk to one of her neighbors, who mentions that her own son was killed when he went looking for a man who was calling him into the alley. While Edie runs to Terry, a truck starts up and rushes toward them both; Terry breaks the window of a nearby door and they jump out of the way. Terry looks at the truck as it speeds off and sees his brother hanging by a longshoreman's hook piercing his coat. There are several bullet holes in his chest. Terry, his arm bleeding from the broken glass, hauls his brother down, and distraughtly tells Edie to get Father Barry and stay with Charlie until he arrives.Terry goes immediately to Friendly's bar and holds everyone hostage at gunpoint. Tillio shows up and Terry orders him to stay as well. Father Barry shows up; Terry remains defensive with the pistol while Barry tells him to give it up. Terry tells Barry to ""go to Hell"" and Barry hits him in the face and Terry's hostages escape. Terry begins shouting about how the situation isn't Barry's concern and Barry tells him that shooting Johnny would be useless since the law would favor Johnny. Barry tells Terry that the best thing he can do to avenge his brother's murder is to testify in court and strip Johnny of his power. He also tells Terry to get rid of the gun unless he's too cowardly. He gives Terry a beer; Terry takes a sip and throws the pistol at a picture of Johnny with an important-looking city official, shattering it.At the waterfront crime hearings, Terry testifies about Joey's murder. He's grilled at length about not only being the last person to see Joey alive but also about how Johnny Friendly had angrily said that it was necessary to have Joey killed to protect his interests in the union. In another office, a man watches the hearings on TV and hears Terry's testimony. He orders the TV shut off and tells his assistant that he won't accept any calls from Johnny Friendly. Terry finishes on the stand and, as he walks past Johnny, who's been called to the stand. Johnny mutters threats and becomes furious and attacks Terry, finally calming down.Terry goes home, followed by two cops. He tells them to stop following him and they scoff. He passes a friend on the stairs, who refuses to talk to him. In his apartment, Edie is waiting. Terry talks about losing his friends because he testified and Edie asks if they are ""real"" friends to him anyway. Terry goes up to the roof and finds that Tommy has killed all of his pigeons. Edie suggests that they leave the waterfront and go to a farm out west where they'll be left alone. Terry notices a ship coming in to Johnny's pier and, grabbing his hook and donning Joey's jacket, goes to the pier.At the pier, Terry receives a cold welcome from his former friends. He stands there while Big Mac calls the workers in. Mac passes Terry over for a job and when Terry suggests they need more men, Mac hires the first homeless man standing in the area. Terry becomes enraged and marches down to the gangplank leading to John Friendly's office. He throws his hook at the door and Johnny emerges. Knowing that attacking Terry in public would get him into deeper trouble, he tells Terry to get lost. Terry begins to berate Johnny openly, telling him he's proud that he testified against Johnny, especially for killing anyone who crossed him. Johnny goads Terry into charging him and the two begin to fight. When it becomes obvious that Johnny will lose, he calls his goons in to help and they viciously beat Terry. Father Barry and Edie arrive on the scene just as Johnny orders his thugs to stop. The owner of the ship that arrived demands to know when the men will begin unloading the cargo and Johnny begins to muscle his way through the crowd, ordering the onlookers to begin working. When he reaches Pop Doyle, he grabs him. Pop pushes Johnny off the gangplank and into the water; the crowd cheers. A few of the men find Terry and see how badly he's been beaten. Barry encourages Terry to get up and walk to the pier to go to work (he also tells Terry that Johnny is taking bets that he won't make it); if he does, the other men will follow him and oust Johnny as their leader. Terry walks up to the pier, stumbling and falling, Father Barry following behind to make sure nobody helps him while he walks. He reaches the pier entrance and the ship's owner calls the rest of the men to work while Johnny continues to yell empty threats. They enter and the door rolls shut behind them."
tt0047396,"['Mystery', 'Thriller']","L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries (James Stewart) recuperates from a broken leg during a sweltering New York summer. As a successful photographer, he's known for taking difficult pictures no one else can get, including the one of an out-of-control race car which smashed his camera and broke his leg an instant after it was snapped. Jeffries lives in a small apartment, and spends his time in a wheelchair looking out the rear window into the courtyard of the building; he can also see into the lives of all his neighbors, catching glimpses of their daily routines. It's the sort of thing only an invalid might do, watching them eat, clean, sleep and argue. There's the girl who exercises in her underwear, the married couple who sleep on their small balcony to beat the heat, the struggling songwriter working at his piano; and there's the salesman who lives across the courtyard from Jeffries, the one with the nagging bedridden wife. They seem to fight all too often.Every day a therapist comes to visit Jeff, dispensing her mature wisdom and berating him for sitting there all day spying on his neighbors. Stella (Thelma Ritter) tells him she can smell trouble coming. He should get his mind off his neighbors and think about marrying that beautiful girlfriend of his. Jeff replies that he's not ready for marriage. ""Sure, she's a wonderful girl, but she's also a rich, successful socialite"", and Jeff lives the life of a war correspondent, always on the go, usually living out his suitcase and often in an unpleasant environment. It's not the life he wants to offer her. ""Well"" says Stella, ""that girl is packed with love for you right down to her fingertips.""""That Girl"" arrives shortly after Stella leaves. Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly) breezes in wearing a stunning satin dress, looking every inch the beautiful socialite she is, and obviously very much in love with Jeff. They have dinner, but soon enough the conversation turns to the future, and they quarrel. Jeff sees no way they can reconcile their different lifestyles, and she walks to the door, telling him goodbye. ""When will I see you again?"" asks Jeffries.""Not for a long time,"" she replies sadly. ""At least, not until tomorrow night.""The night drags by, and it's too hot for Jeffries to sleep. It starts to rain. He dozes in his wheelchair by the window, but notices activity across the yard. The salesman goes out carrying his heavy silver sample case, and Jeffries looks at his watch: it's 1:55am. The blinds in the bedroom are drawn, so Jeffries can't see the wife. Later at 2:35am, the salesman returns, lifting the case easily, as if it were empty. A minute later, he once more goes out in the rain in the middle of the night, lugging the heavy case, but coming home with it lighter. Intrigued, Jeffries wonders what the salesman is doing, but he finally dozes off around daybreak. At daybreak, the salesman is seen leaving his apartment with a woman wearing all black clothing whose face we cannot see. However, Jeffries is fast asleep and does not notice the salesman and the mysterious woman leave.Discussing the incident with Stella, and then later with Lisa, they all begin to watch the salesman. With the blinds now open, they can see that the wife is gone. Jeffries pulls out his binoculars, and then a large telephoto lens to get a better look. Jefferies watches as the salesman goes into the kitchen and cleans a large knife and saw. Later, he ties a large packing crate with heavy rope, and has moving men come and haul the crate away. Stella runs around the front of the building to catch the name of the moving company, but misses the truck. By now they're all thinking the same thing; there's foul play going on, and the missing wife has been murdered by the salesman. They check his name on the front of the building: Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr).Jeffries calls in an old Army buddy - Thomas J. Doyle (Wendell Corey) who's now a police detective, and explains the situation to him. Naturally he doesn't believe a word of it, and tells Jeffries to stick to photography. That evening, after further checking, the detective finds that Mrs. Thorwald is in the country, has sent a postcard to her husband, and the packing crate they had seen was full of her clothes. Chastened, they all admit to being a little ghoulish, even disappointed when they find out there wasn't a murder after all. Jeffries and Lisa settle down for an evening alone, but soon a scream pierces the courtyard. One of the neighbors had a little dog they would let roam around the yard, and now it's dead with it's neck is broken. It had been digging in Thorwald's small flower garden. All of the neighbors rush to their windows to see what's happened, except for one. Jeffries notices that Thorwald sits unmoving in his dark apartment, with only the tip of his cigarette glowing.The following evening, Jeff notices a change in Thorwald's small flower garden in the courtyard: using a slide he'd taken about two weeks before he discovers that the zinnia that the dog had been digging around is now a few inches shorter. Jeff suspects that Thorwald had buried something there and had dug it up after murdering the dog. Convinced that Thorwald is guilty after all, they slip a letter under his door asking ""What have you done with her?"" and then watch his reaction. Lisa delivers the note and slips away before Thorwald can find her. When she returns to the apartment, excited, Jeff has a look of excitement on his face as well, realizing that Lisa is a courageous woman who likely could accompany him in his adventurous life.Calling Thorwald's apartment, Jeffries tells Thorwald to meet him at a bar down the street, as a pretext to getting him out of the apartment. When Thorwald leaves, Lisa and Stella grab a shovel and start digging, but after a few minutes, they find nothing.Refusing to give up, Lisa climbs the fire escape to Thorwald's apartment and squeezes in an open window, much to Jeffries' alarm. Rummaging around the apartment, Lisa finds Mrs. Thorwald's purse and wedding ring, things she surely would never have left behind on a trip. She holds them up for Jeffries to see, but he can only watch in terror as Thorwald comes back up the stairs to the apartment. Lisa is trapped.Calling the police as Thorwald goes in, he and Stella watch helplessly as Lisa tries to hide, but is found by Thorwald moments later. They see her try to talk her way out, but Thorwald grabs and begins to assault her. Terrified by their helplessness, they can only watch as he turns out the lights and listen as Lisa screams for help. The police arrive and beat on Thorwald's door, saving Lisa just in time.Jeffries watches from across the courtyard as the police question Lisa, then arrest her. Her back is to him, and he see her hands behind her back pointing to Mrs. Thorwald's ring, which is now on her finger. Thorwald sees this as well, and realizing that she's signaling to someone across the way, looks up directly at Jeffries with murderous understanding.Pulling back into the dark, Jeffries calls his detective friend, who agrees to help get Lisa out of jail, and is now convinced that Thorwald is guilty of something. Stella takes all the cash they have for bail and heads for the police station. Jeffries is left alone, and looking back over to Thorwald's apartment, he sees all the lights are off. Down below, he hears the door to his own building slam shut, then slow footsteps begin climbing the stairs. Thorwald is coming for him, and he's trapped in his wheelchair.Looking for a weapon, he can find only the flash for his camera. He grabs a box of flashbulbs, and under his door he watches the hall lights go off. Footsteps stop outside his door, then it slowly opens. Thorwald stands in the dark looking at Jeffries. ""Who are you?"" he says heavily. ""What do you want from me?"" Jeffries doesn't answer, but as Thorwald comes for him he sets off the flash, blinding Thorwald for a few seconds.He is slowed but not stopped, and Jeffries keeps setting off flashbulbs in Thorwald's face, but he finally fumbles his way to Jeffries' wheelchair, then grabs him and pushes him towards the open window. Fighting to stay alive, Jeffries cannot stop Thorwald, and is pushed out. Hanging onto the ledge, yelling for help, he sees Lisa, the detective and the police all rush in. Thorwald is pulled back, but it's too late; Jeffries slips and falls just as the police run up beneath him. Luckily, they break his fall, and Lisa sweeps him up in her arms. Thorwald confesses to the murder of his wife, and the police take him away.A few days later the heat has lifted. The camera pans across the other apartments, and there is an amusing end-tale for each one. Jeffries sleeps peacefully in his wheelchair, now with two broken legs from the fall. Lisa reclines happily next to him, now wearing blue jeans and a simple blouse, and reading a camping book. She smiles at him as he sleeps, but pulls out a hidden fashion magazine from under the cushion."

loving and a good cook. Whether he actually loves her doesn't matter; he wants a full
time maid more than a wife. Milly works at a local bar where the men of the town come
in droves to eat her tasty grub and ask her to marry them, but she always refuses with a
smile and another helping of food. But she falls in love with Adam the moment he walks through the door, and is soon on her way, much to the trepidation of the town pastor and Milly's aunt, to the Pontipee farm in the mountains. There she finds that Adam has six
younger brothers, and that the whole bunch are unmannered lumberjacks with no idea of how to
treat a woman. But Milly's tough love soon smooths out some, if not all, of the brothers' rough edges. On a trip to a barn-raising social in town, Adam's six brothers fall in love
with six very close and very sought-after young girls, and have a wonderful synchronized dance with them and a dance fight with their suitors. When they return to their farm, they
are completely love sick over the girls. Adam is thoroughly amused and Milly is sad for them. But Adam comes
up with a somewhat dubious plan to kidnap the six girls to be the brothers' brides! Modeling his scheme on the story of the Romans' kidnapping of the Sabine women, the brothers go into town and kidnap their sweethearts. They take them back to the Pontipee farm, but not before making such a ruckus that they cause an avalanche which snows in the mountain pass leading to the farm. Now, the girls are stuck at the farm all winter. Of course, the girls and Milly are furious with Adam and his brothers. Milly sends the boys off to sleep in the barn ""with the other livestock."" Adam is so infuriated that he goes off to a hunting cabin to wait out the winter by himself. In the meantime, Milly tells the girls that she is pregnant, and will have a baby in the spring. Over the course of the winter, the brothers gradually fall back into favor with the girls, and by the time spring and Milly's baby come, the couples have all reunited - except for Milly and Adam. Gideon, the youngest brother, goes to Adam's cabin to ask him to come back. Adam learns for the first time that he has a daughter. He eventually returns, and he and Milly make up. After the mountain pass clears, the menfolk from the town make their way up to the cabin to rescue the girls - who now have no intention of leaving their Pontipee beaus. After hearing Milly's baby cry, the pastor asks the girls whose baby he heard. The girls cry out in unison, ""Mine!"" The last scene of the movie is a (literal) shotgun multiple wedding for the 6 brothers and their brides."
tt0047478,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama']","A gang of marauding bandits approaches a mountain village. The bandit chief recognizes they have ransacked this village before, and decides it is best that they spare it until the barley is harvested in several months. One of the villagers happens to overhear the discussion. When he returns home with the ominous news, the despairing villagers are divided about whether to surrender their harvest or fight back against the bandits. In turmoil, they go to the village elder, who declares that they should fight, by hiring samurai to help defend the village. Some of the villagers are troubled by this suggestion, knowing that samurai are expensive to enlist and known to lust after young farm women, but realize they have no choice. Recognizing that the impoverished villagers have nothing to offer any prospective samurai except food, the village elder tells them to ""find hungry samurai.""The men go into the city, but initially are unsuccessful, being turned away by every samurai they ask sometimes rudely because they cannot offer pay other than three meals a day. Just as all seems lost, they happen to witness an aging samurai, Kambei, execute a cunning and dramatic rescue of a young boy taken hostage by a thief. As Kambei walks towards town a young samurai, Katsushiro, asks to become his acolyte. Kambei insists that he walk with him as a friend. Then the farmers ask Kambei to help defend their village; to their great joy, he accepts. Kambei, with Katsushir's assistance, then recruits four more masterless samurai (rnin) from the city, one by one, each with distinctive skills and personality traits. Although Kambei had initially decided that seven samurai would be necessary, he plans to leave for the village with only the four that he has chosen because time is running short. The villagers beg him to take Katsushiro also and, with some prodding by the others, he agrees. A clownish ersatz samurai named Kikuchiyo, whom Kambei had rejected for the mission, follows them to the village at a distance, ignoring their protestations and attempts to drive him away.When the samurai arrive at the village, the villagers cower in their homes in fear, hoping to protect their daughters and themselves from these supposedly dangerous warriors. The samurai are insulted not to be greeted warmly, considering that they have offered to defend the village for almost no reward, and seek an explanation from the village elder. Suddenly, an alarm is raised; the villagers, fearing that the bandits have returned, rush from their hiding places begging to be defended by the newly-arrived samurai. It turns out that Kikuchiyo, until this point merely a tag-along, has raised a false alarm. He rebukes the panicked villagers for running to the samurai for aid after first failing to welcome them to the village. It is here that Kikuchiyo demonstrates that there exists a certain intelligence behind his boorish demeanour. The six samurai symbolically accept him as belonging with them, truly completing the group of wanderers as the ""seven samurai.""As they prepare for the siege, the villagers and their hired warriors slowly come to trust each other. However, when the samurai discover that the villagers have murdered and robbed fleeing samurai in the past, they are shocked and angry, and Kyz, the most professional and calm of the samurai, even comments that he would like to kill everyone in the village. The always clownish Kikuchiyo passionately castigates the other samurai for ignoring the hardships that the farmers face in order to survive and make a living despite the intimidation and harassment from the warrior class, in the process revealing his origins to Kambei, who suddenly perceives that Kikuchiyo is himself a farmer's son. ""But who made them like this?"" he asks. ""You did!"" The anger the samurai had felt turns to shame, and when the village elder, alerted by the clamor that this revelation instigates, asks if anything is the matter, Kambei humbly responds that there is not. The samurai continue their preparations without any animosity, and soon afterward show compassion toward the farmers when they share their rice with an old woman who, her family having been killed by bandits, cries out that she merely wants to die.The preparations for the defense of the village continue apace, including the construction of fortifications and the training of the farmers for battle. Katsushir, the youngest samurai, begins a love affair with Shino, the daughter of one of the villagers. Shino had been forced to masquerade as a boy by her father who hoped the deception would protect her from the supposedly lustful samurai warriors.As the time for the raid approaches, two bandit scouts are killed, and one is captured and reveals the location of the bandit camp. Three of the samurai, along with a guide from the village, decide to carry out a pre-emptive strike. Many bandits are killed, but one of the samurai, Heihachi, suffers a fatal sword wound when his villager friend lost emotion control upon seeing his imprisoned wife commit suicide. When the bandits arrive in force soon after this raid, they are confounded by the fortifications put in place by the samurai, and several are killed attempting to scale the barricades or cross moats. However, the bandits have a superior number of trained fighters, and possess three muskets, and are thus able to hold their own. Kyz decides to conduct a raid on his own to retrieve one of the muskets and returns with one several hours later. Kikuchiyo, jealous of the praise and respect Kyz earns, particularly from Katsushir, later abandons his post to retrieve another musket, leaving his contingent of farmers in charge. Although he succeeds, the bandits attack the post, overwhelming and killing many of the farmers. Kambei is forced to provide reinforcements from the main post to drive the bandits out, leaving it undermanned when the bandit leader charges this position. Although they are driven off, Gorobei is shot and killed and it is revealed that Yohei, Kikuchiyo's friend, was killed at his post.Apart from defense, the initial strategy of the samurai is to allow the bandits to enter a gap in the fortifications one at a time through the use of a closing ""wall"" of spears, and to then kill the lone enemy. This is repeated several times with success, although more than one bandit manages to enter the village several times. On the second night, Kambei decides that the villagers will soon become too exhausted to fight and instructs them to prepare for a final, decisive battle. During the night, Katsushir's affair is revealed, and after an initial uproar, his amorous adventures provide comic relief to the embattled militia.When morning breaks and the bandits make their attack, Kambei orders his forces to allow all 13 remaining bandits in at once. In the ensuing confrontation, most of the bandits are easily killed, but the leader takes refuge in a hut unseen. In what is portrayed as dishonorable act, he shoots Kyz in the back from the safety of the hut, killing him. A despondent Katsushir seeks to avenge his hero, but an enraged Kikuchiyo bravely (and blindly) charges ahead of him, only to be shot in the belly himself. Although mortally wounded, Kikuchiyo ensures he kills the bandit chief, finally proving his worth as a samurai, before dying. Dazed and exhausted, Kambei and Shichirji sadly observe ""we've survived once again,"" while Katsushir wails over his fallen comrades. The battle is ultimately won for the villagers.The three surviving samurai, Kambei, Katsushir, and Shichirji, are left to observe the villagers happily planting the next rice crop. The samurai reflect on the relationship between the warrior and farming classes: though they have won the battle for the farmers, they have lost their friends with little to show for it. ""Again we are defeated,"" Kambei muses. ""The farmers have won. Not us."" This melancholic observation sheds new light on Kambei's statement at the beginning of the film that he had ""never won a battle."" This contrasts with the singing and joy of the villagers, whose figuratively life-sustaining work has prevailed over war and left all warriors as the defeated party."

One side of the house has been smashed down and the place is nearly destroyed. One of the troopers hears a bizarre ringing noise outside and walks around the back of the house to find the source. The man screams, fires a few shots and is silent, attacked and killed by an unseen enemy.At the police station the young girl meets a scientist who has her smell a pungent substance. She becomes instantly terrified, backing into a corner and screaming the word ""THEM!!!""=================================================================Title (Note: the movie is black and white but the title is in color - red and blue) and credits run over a desert vista with a large desert tree in the foreground. We see a spotter aircraft fly over the desert. Johnny (an uncredited John Close) calls the car below to report something. A little girl is seen wandering in the desert. Johnny circles until the police car arrives. The girl (Sandy Descher) is dressed in a bathrobe and carrying a doll. Sgt. Ben Peterson (James Whitmore) exits the car to retrieve the child. She is in shock and unresponsive to commands. Trooper Ed Blackburn (Chris Drake) takes a call from the airplane pilot. Johnny has spotted a trailer about three miles down the road. Ben and Ed take the girl and drive down the road to investigate the trailer. They discover the trailer has sustained structural damage but there is no evidence of fire or an explosion. No money has been taken and blood stains are estimated to be less than twelve hours old. Ben finds a piece of cloth and plastic. Ed finds some sugar cubes. A mysterious print in the sand piques their curiosity. Ben matches the cloth from the little girl's bathrobe and the plastic piece fits the missing piece of her doll's head. An ambulance is called and a police team goes over the crime scene. The ambulance attendant (an uncredited William Schallert) assures Ben he'll take good care of the child. They hear a weird chirping noise like crickets, but do not notice the Ellinson girl respond to the sound. They attribute the sound to the wind. Ben asks Cliff (an uncredited Cliff Ferre), who is finishing the plaster mileage on the strange print, what he thinks it might be. The ambulance departs, so Ben and Ed decide to visit the local store run by Gramps Johnson (an uncredited Mathew McCue). They want to know if he knows anything.It is early evening when Ben and Ed arrive at the store. The wind is howling and the store is a shambles. They investigate and discover there is no sign of robbery, but a twisted shotgun indicates Gramps fought off his attackers. They find his dead body in a storage area below the store. Outside the two officers hear a noise. They notice the wall has been pulled away, just like at the trailer. A large barrel of sugar has been turned over. Ben exits the store and leaves Ed to remain until the investigation team arrives. Ed hears the weird chirping sound and goes outside to investigate. We only hear the confrontation -- six shots from Ed's service revolver and a scream.At police headquarters the clues from both scenes are spread out on the table in the office of Capt. Fred Edwards (Don Shelton). They are stumped to make any sense from the clues, including the strange plaster print. They do get a match on fingerprints from the trailer. The Ellinson family was on an extended vacation and the father was an FBI agent. Robert Graham (James Arness), an FBI agent from the office in Alamogordo, joins the investigation. Bob Graham is also stumped. Bob suggests sending the print to Washington for identification. The coroner, Doc. Putnam (an uncredited Joseph Forte) arrives and provides five causes of death. He tells them, ""Johnson could have died in one of five ways; His neck and back were broken, his chest was crushed, his skull was fractured...and here's one for Sherlock Holmes: There was enough formic acid in him to kill twenty men.""Bob Graham receives a telegram from the Bureau telling him to meet Doctors Medford at the airport and extend all cooperation. The FBI was unable to identify the print and sent it to the Department of Agriculture. A military transport, an old North American B-25 Mitchell, arrives and the first out is Dr. Harold Medford (Edmund Gwenn). He is short, plump, and slightly distracted in his own thoughts. Next off the plane is Dr. Medford's daughter, Patricia (Joan Weldon). She is tall, brunette, and very attractive and prefers to be called Pat. Bob Graham immediately takes a shine to this scientist. The four return to police headquarters. The Medfords review the clues and read all the reports. Dr. Medford asks where exactly the first atomic bomb in 1945 was exploded. He is told in the same general area. Dr. Medford thinks out loud, ""1945. That's nine years ago. Yes, genetically its certainly possible."" Bob wants to know what they suspect, but Dr. Medford refuses to explain until he and his daughter are certain of their theory. Dr. Medford wants to stop at a drug store and visit the Ellinson girl at the hospital, then revisit the location where they took the plaster cast of the strange print.At the hospital, Medford examines the girl and consults with the psychiatrist (an uncredited Ann Doran). A small glass filled with formic acid causes the girl to react. She runs and tries to hide while screaming, ""Them! Them!"" The four exit the hospital room and visit the trailer site. The wind is howling and the blowing sand and dust make it hard to see and hear each other. Pat remarks that, ""Rather slim pickings for food, Dad. They'd turn carnivorous for lack of a habitual diet."" Medford agrees, then walks away. Bob wants to know what they are talking about and gets rather insistent. Pat refuses to cooperate, but explains to Bob that her father is an expert myrmecologist, and will tell him when they are sure. Medford discovers a print, and measuring it determines the creature would be over eight feet long. Pat wanders off to find more prints. She discovers one, then she hears the weird chirping sound. It intensifies and the source reveals itself as a giant ant. She screams and backs away. Bob comes to her rescue firing his revolver at the creature, but with little effect. Medford yells they should aim for the antennae, as they are helpless without them. Both antennae are hit and Ben retrieves a machine gun from the police car and fires enough bullets into the creature to kill it. They all approach to get a closer look at the insect. When asked what it is, Medford replies, ""Species appears to be Camponotus Vicinus. One of the family Formicidae. An ant."" Medford speculates that radiation from atomic testing in the desert caused this mutation.General O'Brien (Onslow Stevens), Ben and Medford are aboard a helicopter searching the desert for the nest of the giant ants. Aboard a second helicopter is Bob, Pat, and Major Kibbee (Sean McClory). They are also searching for the nest in another sector. Pat admits she is worried about her father. Pat finds what she is looking for -- a cone shaped mound with a large opening on top. They circle the mound and see an ant drop a human rib cage over the side. Human skulls, a police belt with bullets and other bones are littered at the base of the mound. Pat proclaims, ""You've just found your missing persons.""In an FBI office, General O'Brien confronts Dr. Medford about his inconsistency. Medford insists secrecy is paramount and that time is the most important thing. O'Brien is anxious to bomb the nest and be done with the affair. Medford explains that the ants won't be in the nest at night and that there are other factors to consider, therefore the nest must be examined before they can destroy it. He proposes to attack them during the day with poison gas, then examine the nest to verify all are dead. During the hottest part of the next day, O'Brien and Ben fire a bazooka with phosphorus shells onto the mound to keep the area hot and the ants below. Bob Graham and Maj. Kibbee also lace the mound with incendiary shells. The Medfords watch and wait. Bob and Ben approach the opening with cyanide gas grenades. A worker ant is seen trying to escape the nest and is held off with a machine gun. The two men bombard the nest with the gas grenades.Bob and Ben prepare to enter the nest. Pat approaches dressed for a subterranean exploration. She tells the men she will accompany them. Bob objects, but Pat explains, ""Someone with scientific knowledge has to go. My father is physically unable to do it. That leaves me."" Bob reluctantly agrees and the three descend into the nest. At first, all they find are dead ants. Further along and down, they are surprised when a wall begins to collapse and they are confronted by some live ants. They are quickly dispatched with Ben's flamethrower. In the queen's chamber, Pat is disappointed to discover they are too late. Without explaining, she takes a few photographs then orders the contents burned. Ben torches all the eggs and dead adult worker ants.Dr. Medford explains that the empty egg cases in the queen's chamber contained queen ants, which will set up new nests. The team goes to Washington, D.C. to brief a panel of military and government personnel. Medford shows them a film about ants to give them some idea of what they face in combating the insects. Medford punctuates his presentation with a warning if they cannot be stopped, ""Man, as the dominant species of life on Earth will probably be extinct within a year."" A collection center for information is established and all reports of strange phenomena are funneled through same. An Air Force Sergeant (an uncredited Leonard Nimoy) pulls a dispatch off a teletype machine and hands it to a woman to classify. The note refers to a pilot, Alan Crotty, crashing his airplane after witnessing UFOs shaped like ants. He confirms that everything in the building is top secret. Bob and Pat review the dispatch and fly to Brownsville, Texas with Maj. Kibbee to investigate the Crotty report.Alan Crotty (Fess Parker) reluctantly tells his story to what he perceives as an unbelieving audience. Bob, Pat and Kibbee listen and ask a few questions. The three exit Crotty's room and speak with the doctor. Bob tells the doctor to keep Crotty confined. Back in Washington, the Medfords and Bob Graham review what they know so far. Medford takes a call and rushes to the communications room. O'Brien is there and directs Medford to an incoming message. The U.S.S. Viking reports a nest of ants hatched aboard their ship at sea. Only two survivors are rescued by the Navy. The Viking was ordered sunk by Naval gunfire. The Medfords conclude a queen flew aboard and hatched a nest while the ship was anchored in Acapulco, Mexico for the three days and four nights it was there. An official at the meeting (an uncredited Willis Bouchey) is convinced the public should be notified of the danger, but the consensus is to keep things secret to avoid panic. Pat reports that Kibbee, Ben and Bob are in Los Angeles investigating a lead -- the theft of forty tons of sugar.It is Sunday morning and Ben and Bob talk to the rail yard detective (an uncredited Dick Wessel). He reports that the rail car was broken into on Friday night and the yard watchman is being held as a suspect. At police headquarters Bob questions the yard watchman (an uncredited Dub Taylor). Ben was questioning Mrs. Lodge (Mary Alan Hokanson) about the death of her husband. Bob and Ben go to the morgue to see the body and talk to the coroner (an uncredited Russell Gaige). The coroner explains, ""I don't think this happened in a machine."" The missing arm and laceration on the chest are curious. He attributes death to shock and loss of blood. Lodge was with his two children, but he was found alone in his car without any trace of the arm. Bob questions Mrs. Lodge but she tells him she has no clue where her husband took the children that morning. Ben interrupts the interrogation to question patrolmen Ryan (an uncredited John Beradino) and Sutton (an uncredited Robert Berger). They found Thomas Lodge. They show Bob and Ben on the map of the city where they found the body. Bob and Ben interview the four people cited by the officers three drunks and a speeding ticket. A blonde floozy (an uncredited Mary Lou Holloway) is questioned and released. Two of the three drunks are returned to the tank to sleep it off. Ryan explains that the third drunk is at the hospital in the alcoholic ward.The ward doctor (an uncredited Grandon Rhodes) escorts Kibbee, Bob and Ben to see Jensen (Olin Howlin). Jensen tells them that he saw a little airplane and large ants down in the open storm drain channel. Bob comments that the openings look like they may be worth investigating. Jensen's loud outburst disturbs the alcoholic in the next bed (an uncredited Harry Wilson) who pleads, ""Please, my nerves!"" Ryan drives Bob, Ben and Kibbee down onto the river bed. They search the area and find a model airplane. Kibbee finds an ant print, which confirms the drunk's story. A quick call to the kids' mother confirms the model is theirs. The team surmises that Lodge had been playing with his kids in the river, flying the model when one or more of the ants attacked. Lodge had tried to fight them off, becoming grievously wounded and his kids ran for the nearest shelter, a tunnel entrance. Lodge then tried to drive off and was found dead later.A news conference is called on Sunday evening. General O'Brien makes the announcement, ""By direction of the President of the United States, in full agreement with the Governor of the State of California, and the Mayor of Los Angeles. The city of Los Angeles is, in the interest of public safety, hereby proclaimed to be under martial law. Curfew is at 1800 hours. Any persons on the street or outside their quarters after 6:00 p.m. tonight will be subject to arrest by the military police."" O'Brien explains what prompted such drastic action. He explains that giant ants were discovered in New Mexico and a nest has been established in the storm drains under the city of Los Angeles. The military begins to stage for the attack. A field headquarters is established outside the storm drain opening where the model airplane and print was discovered. Search units in Jeeps proceed into the storm drains. About a mile in, Ben hears something and requests all engines be stopped. He investigates a pipe that leads to a section still under construction. He finds Mike Lodge (an uncredited Richard Bellis) and his brother Jerry Lodge (an uncredited Robert Scott Correll) trapped and about to be attacked by the ants. Ben kills the ants with his flamethrower. He rescues the boys and sends them down a pipe back to the safety of his waiting driver, Smitty (an uncredited Joel Smith). Unfortunately his own escape is thwarted. An ant sneaks in from an adjoining tunnel and grabs Ben with its mandibles and crushes him to death. All units are sent to Drain 267 to engage the enemy. O'Brien and Dr. Medford drive to the location. Bob, and a unit of soldiers fight their way to the nest area, killing many ants with gunfire. O'Brien and Medford arrive and order a cease fire. A section of tunnel collapses trapping Bob inside with the ants. Soldiers dig away the rubble and reach Bob before he is killed by the ants guarding the nest of newly hatched queens. All the worker ants protecting the nest are killed. Medford is called and examines the nest. He says, ""This is the egg chamber. I'm certain no new queens have escaped from this nest. The job will be done when these are destroyed."" O'Brien orders, ""Okay, burn them out."" Flamethrowers destroy the winged queen and consort ants. Dr. Medford waxes philosophical, ""When man entered the atomic age, he opened a door into a new world. What we'll eventually find in that new world, nobody can predict."" We close with a slow zoom in shot of the ants on fire and in their death throes."

But the mood is sombre: word has come down that their beloved commanding officer, Major General Thomas F. Waverly (Dean Jagger), is being relieved of command. He arrives for the end of the show and delivers an emotional farewell. The men give him a rousing send-off (""The Old Man"").After the war, over the next 10 years, the pair make it big as performers in nightclubs, radio, and then on Broadway, doing many different songs, and finally becoming successful producers living in Florida. They eventually mount their newest hit musical entitled 'Playing Around'. The same day they receive a letter from ""Freckle-Faced Haynes, the dog-faced boy,"" their mess sergeant from the war, asking them to look at an act which his two sisters are doing.When they go to the club to audition the act (""Sisters""), Phil notices that Bob is slowly smitten with Betty Haynes (Rosemary Clooney), while Phil has eyes for her sister, Judy (Vera-Ellen). Following their number, Betty and Judy join Bob and Phil at their table, and believing he may have found the right woman for Bob, Phil brings Judy on to the dance floor so that Bob and Betty can get to know each other better. Phil and Judy hit it off (""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"").Judy tells Phil that she and her sister are headed for the Columbia Inn in Pine Tree, Vermont, where they are booked to perform over the holidays. Phil gives the sisters his and Bob's sleeping-room accommodations aboard the train to Vermont.When the train arrives in Pine Tree, there's not a flake in sight, and the weather is so unseasonably warm, chances of it falling appear dim. Bob and Phil discover that the inn is run by their former commanding officer, General Waverly. Waverly has invested all of his savings and pension into the lodge, which is in danger of failing because of the lack of snow and consequent lack of guests. Deciding to help out and bring business up to the inn, Bob and Phil bring up the entire cast and crew of their new musical 'Playing Around', and add in Betty and Judy where they can. At the same time, Bob and Betty's relationship starts to bloom (""Count Your Blessings"") and they begin to spend a good deal of time together. Meanwhile, Bob discovers the General's rejected attempt at rejoining the army, and decides to prove to the General that he isn't forgotten.Bob calls Ed Harrison (Johnny Grant), an old army buddy, now the host of a successful TV variety show. Bob tells Ed that he wants to make a televised pitch to all the men formerly under the command of the General, asking them to come to the inn on Christmas Eve as a surprise. In response, Harrison suggests they go all out and put the show on national television, playing up the whole ""schmaltz"" angle of the situation and generating lots of free advertising for Wallace and Davis in the process. What Bob doesn't know is that nosy housekeeper Emma Allen (Mary Wickes) has been listening in to the phone conversation on the extension but has only heard about the whole schmaltz suggestion, hanging up before Bob rejects the idea.Mistakenly believing that her beloved boss will be presented as a pitiable figure on a prime-time coast to coast broadcast, Emma reveals what she heard to a shocked Betty who is originally loath to believe Bob would pull such a stunt for his own gain, but mistakenly comes to believe he would indeed stoop to such depths when Phil asks her if he made the call to Ed. The misunderstanding causes a now-disillusioned Betty to grow suddenly cold toward a baffled Bob. Unaware of the real reason for her sudden change of behavior, Judy becomes convinced that Betty, ever-protective of her little sister, will never take on a serious relationship until Judy is engaged or married. She pressures an extremely reluctant Phil to announce a phony engagement, but the plan backfires when Betty abruptly departs for New York City, having received a job offer.Distraught, Phil and Judy reveal to Bob that the engagement announcement was phony, and Bob, still unaware of the real reason behind Betty's annoyance, heads to New York to explain. Bob goes to see Betty's new act (""Love, You Didn't Do Right by Me"") and reveals the truth about the engagement, but is called away by Ed Harrison before he can find out what is really bothering her. The sight of Ed pushes Betty who was nearly forgiving Bob, back down. Meanwhile, back at the Inn, Phil fakes an injury to distract Waverly so he won't see the broadcast or Bob's announcement.On the broadcast, Bob proceeds to ask the veterans of the 151st Division to come to Pine Tree, Vermont, on Christmas Eve (""What Can You Do with a General""). When Betty is backstage between performances, she catches Bob's pitch on a television set and realizes she was mistaken. She returns to Pine Tree just in time for the show on Christmas Eve. Emma convinces Gen. Waverly that all his suits were sent to the cleaners and suggests he wear his old uniform to the opening of the show. Initially reluctant, he agrees. When the General enters the lodge where the show is to take place, he is greeted by his former division, who sing a rousing chorus of ""The Old Man."" Just as the following number (""Gee, I Wish I Was Back in the Army"") ends, he is notified that snow is finally falling.In the finale scene, Bob and Betty declare their love for one another, as do Phil and Judy. The background of the set is removed to show the snow falling, everyone raises a glass, and toasts, ""May your days be merry and bright; and may all your Christmases be white.""

tt0047834,"['Animation', 'Drama']","Manor Farm is a former prosperous farm that has fallen on hard times, and suffers under the now ineffective leadership of its drunken and aggressive owner, Mr. Jones. One night, Old Major, the prize boar and the second-oldest on the farm, calls the animals on the farm for a meeting, where he compares the humans to parasites and encourages them to break free from their tyrant's influence, while reminding them that they must hold true to their convictions after they have gained freedom. With that, he teaches the animals a revolutionary song, ""Beasts of England"", before collapsing dead mid-song to the animals' horror.The next morning, Jones neglects to feed the animals for breakfast, and they decide to break into the storehouse to help themselves. When Jones wakes up and attempts to intimidate them with his whip, the animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible Mr. Jones from the farm, renaming it ""Animal Farm"". They set to work destroying every trace of Jones' influence, mainly the weapons used against them. An investigation of the farmhouse leads them to concede against living there, though one of the head pigs, a boar named Napoleon, who is the film's antagonist, takes interest in the abandoned house, and even more so in a litter of puppies left motherless.The Seven Commandments of Animalism are written on the wall of a barn to illustrate their community's laws. The most important is the seventh, ""All animals are equal."" All the animals work, but the workhorse, Boxer, and his friend Benjamin, the young donkey and the film's protoganist, put in extra work. A young pig named Snowball attempts to teach the animals reading and writing; food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health. Napoleon takes the pups and trains them privately.When Snowball announces his idea for a windmill, Napoleon opposes it. Snowball makes a speech in favor of the windmill, whereupon Napoleon has his dogs chase Snowball away. In Snowball's absence, Napoleon declares himself leader and makes changes. Meetings will no longer be held and instead a committee of pigs will run the farm. Using a young pig named Squealer as a mouthpiece, Napoleon spurs the animals into setting forth his regime. The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill.Napoleon abuses his powers, making life harder for the animals; the pigs impose more control while reserving privileges for themselves. During this time, the pigs also decide to start altering their own laws. ""No animal shall sleep in beds"" is changed to ""No animal shall sleep in beds with sheets"" when the pigs are discovered to have been sleeping in the old farmhouse. ""No animal shall drink alcohol"" is changed to ""No animal shall drink alcohol to excess"" when the pigs discover the farmer's whisky. Despite this, most animals keep believing that the pigs are acting in the best interest of all animals.Before long, Napoleon's greed drives him to negotiate with a local trader named Mr. Whymper for a supply of jellies and jams. The price is all the hens' eggs. When the hens discover this, they attempt to revolt by throwing their eggs at the pigs during an attempted seize by force. To instill fear, Napoleon not only puts the hens at the hands of the pig committee, but also selects a duck and sheep to be false accused of treachery. They are taken outside and murdered by the dogs, with their blood used to edit a commandment regarding killing to being legal ""with cause"". ""Beasts of England"" is banned as inappropriate, as according to Napoleon, the dream of Animal Farm has been realized.Growing jealous of Whymper's financial success due to his trading with Animal Farm, a hostile group of farmers attacks the farm, and Jones, who was denied the chance to rejoin them, uses blasting powder to blow up the windmill with himself inside. Though the animals win the battle, they do so at great cost, as many, including Boxer, are wounded. Boxer continues working harder and harder, until he collapses one night while working on the windmill. Napoleon sends for a van to take Boxer to a vetinarian. Benjamin notices that the van belongs to Mr. Whymper's glue factory, and attempts to mount a rescue. However, his attempts are futile and Boxer is taken away, presumably to his death. Squealer delivers a phony speech, claiming to have been at Boxer's side at his deathbed, and his last words being to glorify Napoleon. He also dismisses any claim that Boxer was sold in exchange for money. The hurt animals fully realize that Boxer's death was planned simply to promote further loyalty to Napoleon's dictatorship, but are sent away by the snarling dogs.Years pass, and the pigs now have learned to walk upright and wear clothes. Napoleon now dresses in a suit with medals (a reference to Nikita Khrushchev). The Seven Commandments are reduced to a single phrase: ""All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others."" Napoleon holds a dinner party for a delegation of outside pigs, who congratulate Napoleon on having the hardest-working animals in the country on the least feed. Napoleon gives a toast to when pigs own and operate farms everywhere.Benjamin, overhearing the conversation, imagines the faces of the pigs changing into the face of Mr. Jones. Realizing that things have become ""worse then ever for ordinary creature"", all of the animals unite together to overthrow Napoleon. The film closes with a smashed portrait of Napoleon as he is being overwhelmed by the animals and beaten to death."

The train discharges a single passenger with only one arm named John J. Macreedy.The conductor comments that this is the first time in four years that the train has stopped there. Macreedy replies that he is only staying for one day, and the conductor comments that ""in a place like this a day can be a lifetime."" The train departs. Macreedy is confronted by the stationmaster who complains that he had not been informed that the Streamliner was stopping, to which Macreedy replies ""Maybe they didn't think it was important."" Macreedy asks the stationmaster if he can get a cab to Adobe Flat. The stationmaster replies ""no cab."" Macreedy then asks if the hotel is open, and the stationmaster nods. Macreedy walks into town.When the townsfolk learn that Macreedy wants to visit nearby Adobe Flat, they react with extreme suspicion and hostility. Pete Wirth, the hotel keeper, tries using a bogus excuse about war restrictions to deny renting a room even though it is obvious the hotel has vacancies. After persistence, Macreedy rents a room, only to be harassed by a cowboy named Hector for no apparent reason. Macreedy's attempts to rent a car create further hostility, prompting another local, Reno Smith, to have a private detective he knows in Los Angeles check out Macreedy's background. Macreedy then visits the sheriff's office only to find that the sheriff, Tim Horn, is an ineffectual drunken sot. Macreedy mentions that he is trying to locate a farmer named Kumoko at Adobe Flat and Horn becomes as hostile as the rest of town. Smith then accosts Macreedy feigning friendliness. Macreedy asks about Kumoko, and Smith tells him that Kumoko was sent to an internment camp after the start of the war. Pete's sister Liz drives up in her jeep and rents it to Macreedy, who drives off to Adobe Flat. Despite Liz's assurance that Macreedy will find nothing and Horn's feeble attempts to assert his authority, Smith, after hearing from the private eye that there are no records on Macreedy, orders another local, Coley Trimble, to get rid of Macreedy, despite protests from Pete and the town doctor, Doc Velie. At Adobe Flat, Macreedy finds only a burned out house, a deep well and wildflowers growing in the dirt. Returning to town, Trimble rams Macreedy off the road, then harasses him for being a ""road hog."" Macreedy decides to leave but is unable to get transportation to the next town and finds that the train will not come until the next morning. After enduring comments of racial bigotry relating to Kumoko, Macreedy is convinced that Smith is trying to kill him and attempts to telephone the police, but Pete will not help him. The doc offers Macreedy his hearse for escape, but it has been tampered with and will not start. After trying to telegraph the police, Macreedy visits the caf√©, where Coley goads him with more bigoted slurs. Macreedy downs Coley with judo, then accuses Smith of murdering Kumoko; he is convinced that the wildflowers hide something buried at Adobe Flat. Macreedy reveals that Kumoko's son Joe died as a result of saving his life in Italy during the war, earning a medal that Macreedy is bringing to his father. Doc and Pete then confess that Kumoko leased Adobe Flat from Smith under false pretenses of available water. Kumoko, despite being cheated, dug the deep well, enraging Smith. Smith's anger intensified after he was turned down by the Marines; after getting drunk he decided to ""scare the Jap"" along with Coley, Pete, Hector and Sam, the caf√© owner. The incident got out of hand and Kumoko was killed. Pete then calls Liz and asks her help in getting Macreedy out of town. Liz drives him out of town into the hands of Smith. Smith shoots Liz to silence her, then turns the rifle on Macreedy. Macreedy creates a Molotov cocktail with jeep gas, his necktie and a glass bottle. He hurls the bottle at Smith, catching him on fire. Returning to town with Smith, Macreedy finds the other four witnesses locked up in a cell. The next morning, the police escort the prisoners away as the Streamliner pulls in. Macreedy, after hearing pleas from Doc, gives him the medal awarded to Kumoko's son Joe. The conductor comments that the excitement must be the reason that the train stopped here for the first time in four years. Macreedy comments ""second,"" then boards the train."

tt0047923,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'Approved']","Major Charles 'Copper' Carrington (David Niven), who has had a distinguished war record and was awarded the Victoria Cross, is arrested for embezzling 125 pounds (about ¬£5000 today) from his unit's safe. Other charges include leaving the base, when he was supposed to be putting his men through some exercises, and entertaining a woman officer in his room, which was forbidden by the base commander Colonel Henniker (Allan Cuthbertson).Appearing in his own defence, Carrington's case at his court-martial is that he took the money openly and without secrecy because of all the back pay owed him. The Army Paymaster has failed to pay him back for various expenses during postings in the Far East and his wife Valerie (Margaret Leighton) has been pressuring him for money. She lives in another part of the country, has become ill as a result of the financial worries and has even threatened suicide.Carrington claims that he told his superior, Colonel Henniker, about his decision to remove the money. He transferred ¬£100 of it to his wife's account in order to give her relief from her financial problems. He then left the base in order to compete in a major horse race in which he betted the rest of the money on himself. He would thus be able to pay back the cash taken from the safe. He succeeded but then fell from his horse in another race. When his friend Captain Alison Graham (Noelle Middleton) tried to return the money she was denied access to the safe.As for the incident in his room, it is established that Carrington was bed-ridden at the time as a result of his fall and that Graham was visiting him in order to discuss the matter of the embezzlement. She was fully-dressed and sitting on a chair when they were interrupted by Colonel Henniker who stormed into the room reminding them that it was against regulations for a male and female officer to be together in private quarters. He and Carrington argued and there was a bit of a fight. Henniker admits waiting for some time between seeing Graham go to Carrington's room and then going there himself.Colonel Henniker is in fact Carrington's enemy. He resents his war record and achievements and his popularity at the base. There is an element of sympathy for Carrington's actions and it is pointed out that the Major could be cleared if it is established that Henniker had forewarned knowledge of his intentions. He thus perjures himself at the court-martial by denying being told by Carrington of his decision to take the money from the safe in order to temporarily settle his debts. Much of these debts were due to Henniker's constant delays in pursuing the matter of the Paymaster's failure to pay Carrington the money owed to him.Carrington's wife Valerie has turned up for the hearing. Due to her poor health he did not intend to call her as a witness; but, when the case goes against him following Henniker's ""evidence"", he decides that he will have to. She resents the idea of washing their dirty linen in public, but finally agrees.Things go wrong, however, when certain conversations make Valerie suspicious about Carrington's friendly relationship with Captain Graham. Under pressure, Graham admits to Valerie that she had a one-night stand with Carrington when they became stranded in a pub in the middle of a snow storm. But Carrington then insisted that a full affair would not be fair on anyone and ended it. He and Graham are now just friends.Valerie appears in court, and gives evidence, but now she also perjures herself by denying that her husband ever told her, during a crucial telephone conversation about of his motives for what he did, that he had informed Colonel Henniker he was taking the money. Carrington produces a letter that Valerie wrote to him after that telephone conversation, specifying his grievances against the Army's delay in paying what he was owed. Since the letter also contains some embarrassing matters about the couple and Valerie's health, Carrington intends to only read the parts that he feels are relevant to his defence, but the judge insists that he and the other officials must read it in full before it is submitted into evidence. Rather than allow this, which Valerie had said she did not want to happen, Carrington tears the letter up and abandons his attempts to persuade Valerie to state in evidence that he had told her he was informing his colonel of his removal of the money from the safe.The officers who are to determine his fate are themselves a little unsettled by the way things are going. Some of them have seen through the lies told in court and sympathise with Carrington's position, motives and actions. The senior officer reminds them, however, that the law says that the case must be decided on the evidence presented, and not on what they may think about the defendant, or what they surmise about what was in that letter which the defendant decided not to put into evidence for obvious but unspoken reasons. On a majority of 3 to 2, Carrington is found guilty on all counts and dismissed from the service.The verdict is soon all over the base. The regular soldiers are near-unanimous that it is an unfair decision. One of them, Owen (Victor Maddern), was a Sergeant who was demoted when loyalty to Carrington resulted in him failing to co-operate with the investigation. He was later demoted again and is now a mere Private due to his behaviour in court, but feels that this time he has had his money's worth.Having made his grievances public, Carrington has decided to let the matter rest. His marriage is also over, but, with an attitude that is typical of him, he puts it down to the fact that Valerie is still really in love with her late husband who was killed during the war and was the father of her two sons.But then, as he exits the building where the court-martial was held, the other soldiers rally around and display their support for him. Also, crucially, in the course of gossiping about the case, another private, a girl working at the telephone exchange, admits overhearing Carrington's phone conversation with his wife and what was really said... The flag is lowered to half mast on the flagpole as the movie ends, with Carrington, moved by the support, at last prepared to put in an appeal against the verdict."

He writes an anonymous note to the police, stating that the criminals are hiding in a private home. A shoot-out would almost surely result in innocent people being harmed. He pays a messenger to deliver the note.At home, an old man driving a dump truck pulls into the Hilliard driveway. Glenn shouts for Ellie, who says it is Mr. Patterson to pick up the trash. She says he will come to the door to be paid. Glenn orders her to pay him and examines the check to be sure she hasn't written a note for help. Mr. Patterson notices that Ellie looks ill and she claims to have a headache. Glenn watches from the window as the old man opens the garage door for the trash cans. He sees Glenn's mud-splattered car and stands there looking at it.

He offers to go into the house and get Cindy out, but is told no. He slips away and calls Cindy to tell her that he is on his way over. Cindy doesn't want to leave her parents but her mother forces her too.Once she is gone and Ralphie is asleep, Dan tells Ellie that when the money arrives, one of them will have to go along as hostage, just until the criminals are safely out of town.

Dan convinces Kobish to open the front door because he heard a noise. When Kobish does, Dan shoves him out and locks the door. The police shoot him to death.

The loner Cal is moody and embittered by his belief that his father favors Aron.The Trask family has a farm in the fertile Salinas valley. Although both Cal and Aron had long been led to believe that their mother had died ""and gone to heaven,"" the opening scene reveals that Cal has apparently come to realize that his mother is still alive, owning and running a successful brothel in nearby town of Monterey.After the father's idealistic plans for a long-haul vegetable shipping business venture end in a loss of thousands of dollars, Cal decides to enter the bean-growing business, as a way of recouping the money his father lost in the vegetable shipping venture. He knows that if the United States enters the war, the price of beans will skyrocket. Cal hopes this will finally earn him the love and respect of his father. He goes to his mother Kate (aka: Eve) (Jo Van Fleet) to ask to borrow the capital he needs. She reluctantly lends him $5,000.Meanwhile, Aron's girlfriend Abra (Julie Harris) gradually finds herself attracted to Cal, who seems to reciprocate her feelings despite her being involved with his younger brother.Cal's business goes quite well, and he decides to give the money to Adam at a surprise birthday party for his father, which he and Abra plan together. As the party gets underway, Aron suddenly announces that he and Abra are engaged. While Adam is openly pleased with the news, both Abra and Cal are uneasy, having recently discovered a mutual attraction for one another is emerging, despite their suppressed feelings. Cal makes a surprise birthday present of the money to his father; however, Adam refuses to accept any money earned by what he regards as war profiteering.

Most of the townspeople, including Sam, blame Cal for what has happened. Sheriff Sam persuades Cal to leave town and quotes a Bible verse relating the event to the conflict of Cain and Abel in the land east of Eden.After everyone leaves, Cal tries to talk to Adam, but gets no response and leaves the bedroom. Abra enters the room alone and pleads with Adam to show Cal some affection before it is too late. She persuades Cal to go back into the room.

He and his friend Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) drive a cattle herd from Wyoming to Seattle, by ship to Skagway and through the mountains to Dawson City. On the way, he annoys town boss and self-appointed Skagway judge Gannon (John McIntire) by interrupting a hanging. Webster ends up being taken into custody and jailed. He meets French-Canadian gamine Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet) at the jail, when she brings supper to his cell mate. Renee immediately takes a liking to Webster and flirts with him. Webster doesn't have to wait long for trial, and he's escorted to the saloon to meet with the judge. Renee goes along and Webster calls her ""Freckle Face,"" which irritates her. Judge Gannon asks him who he shot. Webster explains it was two men who took it upon themselves to combine his herd with theirs. The judge agrees that was justified, so he dismisses the case, but he also tells Webster his cows are being confiscated for disturbance of the peace, among other things. Webster wants to take issue with that, but he realizes he's badly outnumbered, and justice usually goes to the strongest at the time.The owner of the saloon, a woman named Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman), asks the judge why he confiscated Webster's cattle. ""Because I wanted them,"" he says. Webster and Tatum decide to make for the Klondike, even though they lost their cattle, and begin making preparations. Ronda just happens to be heading up a party bound for Alaska with the cows and she offers Webster a job as her trail boss. Since Webster and Tatum are down to their last $50, and it requires a minimum $100 in food and supplies to receive permission from Judge Gannon to head up the trail, Webster agrees to the job. Plus, he's obviously attracted to Ms. Castle and her to him.Not long into their trip, Webster, Tatum and Ben Rube (Jay C. Flippen), slip off during the night, and take off with the cattle. Gannon and his men pursue. After crossing the border into Canada, Webster uses a few well-placed warning shots to persuade Gannon's gang to give up the chase, but the judge promises a hot reception when Webster returns to Skagway, as he must, for it's the only way to get back.Ronda and her men re-join Webster to complete the journey to Dawson City. She still considers Webster to be her employee, obliged to see them all safely through. As they approach 2-Mile Pass, Webster announces that they will take a trail through the valley and not attempt to go over the pass. Ronda tells him that she won't accept him taking an additional six days to go through the valley, but he won't be persuaded, or ordered, to do differently. So, Ronda and her group head for 2 Mile Pass while Webster and his men, with the cattle, head for the valley.What Webster didn't explain to Ronda was that he was concerned about a possible avalanche in the pass. When Tatum asked Webster why he didn't tell her that, Webster just says, ""she wouldn't listen."" It's not long before there's a loud rumbling noise and Webster and the others look up towards the pass to see a large avalanche taking place. Renee, who's along for the trip, quickly calls for the men to head up there and see if the others needed help. Webster refuses at first, but Renee and Tatum appeal to his sense of morality and he begrudgingly agrees to go with them.Three members of Ronda's group were killed and other injured. The survivors rejoin Webster's group and they all continue on to Dawson City. Ronda tricks Webster into reaching for her coffee cup, and she kisses him. Renee witnesses that and gets very upset.When the group get to Dawson, they find widespread (though relatively peaceful) lawlessness. Webster ignores it as none of his business. There's interest in his cattle and Tatum ends up conducting an impromptu auction, where Ronda outbids the co-owners of the local hash house, Hominy (Connie Gilchrist), Grits (Kathleen Freeman) and Molasses (Connie Van). The people of Dawson City have visions of using their hoped for mining wealth to create a regular town where they can live and raise families. However, Gannon and his gunmen show up in Dawson City and begin cheating the miners out of their claims. One man who takes issue with that is shot to death. The others in town are advised to leave Dawson City and never come back. Dawson has suddenly become a very dangerous place to be.Webster chooses to stay out of the fray, figuring it's better to stay alive and be able to take another direction in life, if need be, or at least wait until the odds are more favorable. He secretly plans to sneak out and make his way back south, while Gannon is otherwise occupied. He and Tatum get down to the river, where Webster has stashed a raft. However, Gannon had been tipped off when Tatum bought some extra coffee for a long trip, and he and his men ride up on them, shooting and killing Ben and wounding Webster.Webster manages to load Tatum's body onto a horse, and then gets on his own horse and rides back to Dawson City. No one makes a move to help until Renee sees them and she goes to Webster's cabin and tends to his wounds. She also makes arrangements for Tatum's burial.Webster is itching to strap on his gun and go after Gannon as soon as he wakes up to find Renee tending to him, but realizes his right hand is wounded too bad. Ronda comes to the cabin to check on Webster. Renee wants Webster to make her leave, but he allows her to stay, so Renee leaves, angry. Ronda wants Webster to leave things be, as far as Gannon is concerned. She believes if Webster tries to do anything, he'll be killed, but Webster isn't about to let Gannon get away with having murdered Tatum.Even though his hand is still not healed, Webster decides to strap on his gun and carry his rifle and go face down Gannon. First, he scares off two of Gannon's men who were in the process of placing a notice on his gold claim, identifying it as now belonging to Gannon.Webster sends his horse down the street, to walk in front of the saloon, where Gannon and his men waited. They were expecting him, so it was very quiet, and they could hear the sound of the small bell attached to the saddle horn (Tatum had been carrying that bell around, intending to put it somewhere in the ranch house they planned to establish in Utah). Two of Gannon's gunmen, Madden (Robert J. Wilke) and Newberry (Jack Elam), were standing in the dark in front of the saloon, ready to shoot down Webster as he rode up. After they are surprised to see that it's a rider-less horse, they start looking around. Webster steps out of the shadows across the street and yells at them. They all start shooting. Webster is hit by a fragment in his cheek, but he shoots and kills Madden and Newberry. Webster then calls Gannon to come out and settle the dispute man-to-man. Gannon confirms that his men know when to come outside, then he slips out the back door and sneaks around the side. Before Gannon can complete his ambush, Ronda rushes out the front door to warn Jeff. Gannon shoots her in the back, killing her. Jeff rushes forward and falls down near Ronda, asking her why she couldn't have just gone away. Gannon and Webster continue their gunfight, shooting at each other from opposite ends of the porch, until Webster shoots and kills Gannon. Gannon's men in the saloon failed to appear in time to help, or save, Gannon. When they did finally step out onto the porch of the saloon, they found themselves facing the rest of the townspeople who were all pointing guns at them. They decide it's time they left town, and they go. Renee rushes up to Webster, ready to help him with his newest wounds."

She walks past old Mr. Porter's house and observes him using a new spray on his lilies. He sputters when she informs him that the flowers will die. Later, she proves to be correct. She passes the home of Tommy and Jincey Baker, both former pupils. Tommy is now a doctor and Jincey is expecting their first child any day. Since Miss Dove doesn't believe in nicknames, she calls them Thomas and Virginia. Alex and Polly Burnham are also on Miss Dove's route. He is the pastor of the local church. David, their son, rudely declares that he hates oatmeal. His mother tells him to hurry, that Miss Dove has just passed and he doesn't want to be late.Children in Miss Dove's class are expected to have a clean handkerchief pinned to their clothing. They file into her classroom in an orderly manner, responding politely with ""Good morning Miss Dove"" when she greets them. She has strict rules and expects them to be obeyed, yet she is not unkind.Flashbacks show how Miss Dove became a teacher. Her wealthy father died shortly after she finished college. They were very close and Mr. Dove had promised to take his daughter on a trip to Europe. She had a beau, Mr. Pendleton, and hoped that their friendship would eventually ripen into something more. But the sudden death of Mr. Dove changed everything. To her horror, Miss Dove learns that she is destitute. Her father's home was heavily mortgaged and not only that, he had embezzled money from the bank where he worked. To prevent a scandal, Miss Dove persuades Mr. Porter, the bank president, to transfer the debt to her. Since she has read her father's books on geography, she feels qualified to teach that subject in the elementary school. Thus begins her teaching career.Back in the present time, Miss Dove overhears David using a swear word. While the rest of the class goes to lunch, David has to write 50 times ""Nothing is achieved by swearing."" Suddenly Miss Dove feels a crushing pain in her lower spine. She tries to stand up but cannot. Reluctantly she asks David to go home and have his father fetch Dr. Hurley. But he is ill and Tommy Baker comes in his place. It is obvious that Miss Dove would rather have her own doctor, but Tommy is available and she tells him her symptoms. He and Alexander make a chair with their arms and carry her to the hospital, just two blocks away. Tommy didn't want to jostle her spine by putting her in a car.Another of Miss Dove's former pupils, William ""Bill"" Holloway, is now a policeman. He races to the hospital to have them reserve a room for Miss Dove. By the time she arrives, a crowd has gathered. Miss Dove is assigned a nurse, Mrs. Greene, who reveals that she is the former Billie Jean McVey. Miss Dove finds her overly caring manner irritating. Billie Jean was once engaged to Bill Holloway but he broke up with her several weeks earlier.Once settled in bed, Miss Dove reminisces about Bill, who was one of her favorite pupils. He was being raised by an alcoholic grandmother in a shack outside town. Miss Dove sees potential in him and hires him to do her yard work. Later, she is the only one who attends his grandmother's funeral. After a tour of duty in the Army, Bill returns to Liberty Hill and becomes a police officer.Tommy visits and tells Miss Dove that the following day she will have a battery of tests. Until then she is not to worry. The room fills up with flowers and Miss Dove dispatches Billie Jean to give them to other patients. Later, Billie Jean confides that she is not really Mrs. Greene. She took the name for her daughter's sake. When she told Bill about her past, he broke up with her. Miss Dove believes he has made a mistake and later praises Billie Jean, causing Bill to change his mind.Other visitors stop by to see their favorite teacher, including Maurice Levine and Fred Makepeace. Maurice is a playwright and earlier had invited Miss Dove to New York as his guest, to see his new play. When Maurice was in her class, the others made fun of him because he was Jewish. Miss Dove put a stop to that by having his parents invite the class to a Passover meal at their home. This changed their opinion of Maurice. Fred Makepeace was among what Miss Dove considered her failures. He was a petty thief as a child and eventually was sent to prison for armed robbery as an adult. While on a chain gang, he heard of Miss Dove's illness and escaped to visit her, stealing a suit from a funeral home. Miss Dove is unaware that Fred is ""on the lam"". Later, he is captured by Bill Holloway.After many scans and tests, Miss Dove awaits word on her condition. Tommy and Mr. Porter visit her. Mr. Porter is there representing the Rotary Club, who has voted to assume full financial responsibility for her medical bills. They can even charter a plane to transfer her to the Mayo Clinic or Johns Hopkins, if she wants. Tommy tells her that she has a growth on her spine and it must, if possible, be removed. He won't know until he performs the surgery whether the tumor is malignant or not. Miss Dove decides to remain in Liberty Hill for the surgery. Although she at first refuses Mr. Porter's offer, she decides to accept it after learning that it is not charity Liberty Hill offers her, but respect.Not knowing whether she will survive the surgery or if the tumor is malignant, Miss Dove gives Tommy her father's gold pocket watch. It is bequeathed to him in her will, but she wants him to have it temporarily. If all goes well and she will be all right, he can return it.The surgery takes hours and the crowd in front of the hospital grows larger. They are finally told to go home, that a report will not be available until the next morning. Billie Jean chases away a group of children who want to give blood. She tells them the best thing they can do for Miss Dove is to go home and study for the state proficiency tests, which are coming up.The next morning, church bells ring as the town learns that Miss Dove's surgery was a success. Tommy tells her that Jincey gave birth to twin boys and that they will be a handful in school. He returns the watch to her. Miss Dove is puzzled as to why the church bells are ringing. Billie Jean reports that the crowd in front of the hospital is wild with excitement and that the schools are closed. At this, Miss Dove replies that they must not close the schools because the children need to review for the proficiency tests. But she is obviously touched that so many of her former pupils care about her."

The captain orders the vessel to flank speed and sends the sub to battle stations while beginning evasive maneuvers.As the sub dives away from the object, something hits the vessel, and radiation warning sounds throughout the ship. Inspecting the detectors the crew realizes the source of the radiation is outside the sub. With a jolt the boat comes to a complete stop. The commander immediately orders the sub to surface; this cant be dome due to something fouling the diving planes.After a number of unsuccessful attempts the sub breaks free and manages to reach the surface. During an inspection the stern of the vessel is radioactive and some sort of organic material, possibly part of a fish is jammed in one of the control planes.Puzzled, the captain elects to return to Pearl Harbor for repairs and to give a detailed report of the incident.

Prof Joyce is in a very negative mood about the investigation, she fears her own lines of research are going to be affected. Mathew informs her that she has effectively drafted for the investigation and she will be expected to stay involved as long as required and she will be compensated for her efforts.12 days later, the investigation is ongoing but really achieving very little. Mathews has begun to show a definite interest in Joyce. Initially she is cool to Mathews advances, considering him her intellectual inferior. Oddly she is not forthright in telling Mathews to leave her alone. The next day Prof Joyce makes a breakthrough and discovers what the specimen is. Mathews immediately contacts his superiors and a number of high ranking navy officials are heading to Hawaii to hear the answer.With everyone gathered Joyce explains the specimen is a piece of giant squid. Normally found in very deep areas of the sea, she has a theory that hydrogen bombs have upset its habitat. This causes the beast rise to the surface to find sources of food.It is noted that in recent times a number of Japanese fishing vessels have gone missing and the Siberian seal hunting season has failed due to a lack of animals.

Reports have arrived of the tramp steamers sinking, and a rescue mission has been launched.Survivors are found and returned to Pearl Harbor. Each man is interviewed and repeats the story of the destruction of the ship. Even after crew accept lie detectors and interviews by psychologists the authorities remain unconvinced about the event Doctor Joyce interviews one of the survivors and secretly records the conversation for the navy.On hearing his story first hand, the navy are convinced there is something behind the story, they mobilizes their forces, and close the western Pacific to all shipsA further 10 days pass and Joyce and Carter argue that even if the navy find the creature they have little or no hope of destroying it. To narrow the search an alert is sent out for any unusual events, the scientists will investigate these events and see if they can narrow down the search area.From Astoria Oregon a strange report comes through, Joyce and Mathews investigate a strange set of markings found on a beach and reports of a very strange car accident. They also continue to explore their relationship.It is suggested the beach be closed to avoid any further chance of further attacks. A local sheriff thinks the whole thing is a waste of time and decides to explore the beach for himself. In short order he is killed.The navy sees this as strong evidence of the creatures movement and begin to narrow their search around San Francisco, even deciding to lay a series of minefields around the bay. A trap is set using dead sharks as bait. Aircraft patrol overhead waiting for any sign of the beast. It has been decided the only way to be sure of destroying the creature is to damage the brain. Amid the tension Dr Joyce reveals a new jet propelled torpedo that might be successfully deployed against the creature.A command center set up by the military reports that an unknown contact is moving towards San Fran harbor. As planned they begin detonating the mine fields in hope of driving the creature off. The mines have no effect and the second stage of the defense is put into action. An electrical current is run through the Golden Gate bridge and into the water. Enraged the creature surfaces.Joyce and Mathews rush to the bridge to get a firsthand look at what they are fighting. Carter understands that unless he shuts the power off there is a serious risk to the bridge. To succeed he has to go out onto the deck and expose himself the outraged squid.The creature continues attacking the bridge and Mathews sees Carter is trapped and drives out to rescue him. Carter finally shuts the power down and the beast slips beneath the waves.The creature surfaces near the Market Street docks and begins destroying everything in its path. Mathews rejoins his sub with orders to attack the creature. From the shoreline soldiers armed with flame throwers force the creature back into the water. This give Mathews the clear shot he is looking for.The attack is successful but in its thrashing around the creature pins the sub on the bottom of the harbor. Mathews cant detonate the torpedo until the submarine is clear or he risks killing the crew. Mathews dons scuba gear and goes out to attack the creature.Although partially successful he himself is badly wounded and sinks to the bottom. Carter then replicates Mathews efforts, however he aims for the creatures eye. The attack works and the creature convulses from the injury and releases the sub.

Hammer turns to his affectionate assistant Velda (Maxine Cooper) and Nick (Nick Dennis), his garage mechanic to track down helpful information and she finds the addresses of Christina's roommate Gabrielle (Gaby Rodgers), scientists, and art dealers who all have an interesting connection to a group of thugs composed of Carl Evello (Paul Stewart), Charlie Max (Jack Elam) and Sugar Smallhouse (Jack Lambert) and a mysterious box that holds the key to the mystery. An evil doctor named Soberin (Albert Dekker) catches up with Hammer and a finale brings about tremendous happenings.======================================================This is a more detailed Synopsis.The movie opens with a woman, Christina Bailey (Cloris Leachman) running down the middle of a street wearing just a trench coat. It is dark and she tries to flag down several cars with no luck. Finally, in desperation, she blocks the street forcing Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) to swerve his sports car into the soft shoulder of the road. Very annoyed, he tells her to get into his car. He drives down the road. Credits roll in reverse from top to bottom to the Nat King Cole song, ""Rather Have the Blues"" playing on the radio. Christina keeps looking back. She tells Mike she's heading for Los Angeles. They come to a road block. ""A woman escaped from an asylum upstate"", is the reason given by the police. Mike tells the officer his wife was asleep, explaining her appearance in ""his"" trench coat in an open top roadster. Mike stops at a service station. The mechanic finds and dislodges a shrub caught in the front wheel. Christina uses the bathroom, and then asks the mechanic (Robert Sherman) to mail a letter for her. They resume their journey. She tells Mike if they don't make it to her bus stop to ""remember me."" A large black Cadillac pulls out and blocks the road. Three men get out. Next we hear screaming and see a woman's legs twitching. Christina is being tortured with a pair of pliers (discreetly off camera). Mike is unconscious on a bare metal bed spring mattress. Mike awakens and learns Christina is dead. He and Christina are put in his car and pushed over a cliff. He is thrown clear before the car crashes and burns. The Cadillac pulls away.Mike wakes in a hospital room to the faces of a nurse (Mara McAfee) and his secretary, Velda Wickman (Maxine Cooper). The doctor enters and tells Lt. Pat Murphy (Wesley Addy) he has five minutes. Pat asks Mike what happened. Sometime later Mike is discharged. As he leaves with Velda, he is immediately detained for questioning by the Interstate Crime Commission. Pat waits outside the hearing room. FBI agents (Robert Cornthwaite and James Seay) ask Mike about his business. They are investigating Christina's death. Mike deduces Christina was involved ""in something big."" He sees a potential business opportunity.Mike takes a cab to see his mechanic, Nick (Nick Dennis). He is told the car was totaled, and that a couple of tough guys were looking for him. The tough guys are waiting outside Mike's apartment building when he gets home. He carefully approaches his apartment door, expecting someone waiting to ambush him, but the place is empty. The phone rings and the answering machine picks up; it is Velda, she tells him she is on her way over. Velda arrives, followed shortly by Pat--official business. Pat lets himself in. He revokes Mike's Private Investigator license and his gun permit. Mike asks Pat about a science reporter, Ray Diker. Mike and Velda discuss a return to their usual business--divorce investigations.In a different sports car, Mike is on his way to visit Ray Diker (Mort Marshall). He is followed by an attacker (Paul Richards). Mike gets the drop on him and easily disarms and dispatches the guy. He proceeds to Diker's apartment. It is clear the man is terrified as he shows signs of an earlier beating. He tells Mike he's afraid, just like Christina. He provides Mike her last name and address. Mike drives to Christina's last known address where he gains the confidence of an old furniture mover (Silvio Minciotti). He gives Mike the current address of Christina's roommate. The apartment manager, Horace (James McCallion) shows Mike the apartment. There he collects a volume of poetry by Christina Rossetti. Mike drives over to see the roommate, Lilly Carver (Gaby Rodgers). She greets him with a gun. They talk. She tells Mike about Christina and the night she was taken away.In his apartment, Mike gets a phone call. He lets the answering machine screen his call. A man's voice recounts the events to date; Mike picks up the phone to talk to the stranger. Mike is told if he ""forgets"" about events he will be rewarded. The next morning a brand new Corvette is parked in front of the building. Nick sees it first and gets in; he intends to drive it around the block before Mike gets there. Mike warns him in time not to touch the car--it is wired with explosives. He finds and removes the bomb, but Mike tells Nick to drive slowly over to the shop to find the second bomb. Mike asks Nick to discreetly find out who planted the bombs. This little task will prove to be a fatal one.Mike stops at Velda's apartment to tell her the divorce business is a little too small time; he has something better, ""That girl I picked up was mixed up in something big."" Velda tells Mike that Diker called and left two names and contacts. Leopold Kowolsky / Harvey Wallace and Nicholas Raymondo / Carmen Trivago. Velda tells Mike that Kowolsky was a pro fighter, but she had nothing on Raymondo. She emphasizes ""was"" as they both knew Christina and are both dead.Mike questions Harvey Wallace (Strother Martin) at home while he and his family are eating dinner. Wallace finally admits Kowolsky was pushed in front of his truck and killed. Next on his list is the gym where Kowolsky trained. He sees an old friend and trainer, Eddie Yeager (Juano Hernandez). Mike inquires about Lee Kowolsky. Eddie is shocked and scared. He tells Mike he has ""forgotten"". Two men, Charlie Max (Jack Elam) and Sugar Smallhouse (Jack Lambert) told him if he said anything about Kowolsky he would be killed. Mike calls Pat at police headquarters and asks who Max and Smallhouse work for. He is told Carl Evello (Paul Stewart).At the Evello home, Max and Smallhouse are playing cards and Evello is sitting by the pool having a drink and playing solitaire. Mike arrives in his new car. Evello's half sister, Friday (Marion Carr) is right behind him in her car. She kisses Mike, and then introduces herself. They go into the house and have a drink. Friday is what used to be called ""a very loose woman."" Evello recognizes Mike Hammer and sends Charlie and Sugar to the pool house to see him. Expertly wielding a sap or blackjack, Mike coldcocks Sugar. Charlie is so surprised he exits quickly and quietly back to see his boss. Evello tells Friday to, ""send him into the house."" They talk. Evello admits to placing the explosives in Mikes new car, ""I'll admit that was a little crude...We keep underestimating you."" Their meeting ends on an ominous note--play ball or die.Mike drives over to see Carmen Trivago (Fortunio Bonanova). Like all his other leads, this one is scared. He tells Mike, ""I know nothing."" He does manage to get that whatever ""it"" is, it is small and can be hidden. That evening he returns to see Lilly Carver; she is hiding on the stairs and tells Mike, ""they came again last night, I hid in the basement."" He takes her back to his apartment. Nick has done a little investigating earlier in the day, so when Mike drops by he tells him he has some information about the car bomb. Mike still needs to secure Lilly Carver at his place, so he tells Nick he will be back to talk. Nick crawls under a car to work and is killed by a man we never see. Mike gets Lilly to his apartment and tells her to lock the door and not to answer the phone. Mike drives back to Nick's garage and finds another mechanic Sammy (Jerry Zinneman) holding Nick's dead hand and sobbing. Mike leaves when he hears a police siren.Mike drives to Velda's apartment; They kiss. She asks, ""what kind of trouble are you in this time?"" He tells her Nick is dead. She gives Mike another lead, Dr. Soberin. The next day Mike stops at a nightclub and gets very drunk. The bartender wakes him and says, ""They got Velda."" Mike drives back to the gas station and talks to the attendant. He asks if he remembers who to whom Christina addressed her letter. The attendant tells him, ""Some joker named Mike."" He goes to his office and opens the letter. It only says, ""Remember Me."" Charlie Max and Sugar Smallhouse are there to greet him. Sugar returns the favor with a blackjack of his own. They take Mike to a beach house in his own car. Mike makes a run for it when he gets the chance, but Charlie and Sugar give him a good beating for his attempt. He wakes tied securely to a bed. A man tells Mike he will die, but he can save Velda. The man drugs Mike with sodium pentothal then exits the bedroom. Mike mumbles under the influence of the drug. Carl Evello comes in to question him, but gets nothing. Mike manages to work one hand free from the ropes. He calls out and Carl returns. He lures Carl over and knocks him out. Mike pretends to be Evello and summons Sugar in to kill Mike. Sugar enters the darkened room and stabs his boss, thinking it is Mike. Mike kills Sugar and escapes.Mike returns home; Carver is there and dressed. Mike picks up the book of poetry and reads the sonnet ""Remember Me."" He gets a clue that something may have been inside of Christina. Mike and Lilly visit the coroner's office. The Autopsy Surgeon, Doc Kennedy (Percy Helton) is corrupt and wants money for the key he found in Christina's stomach. Mike pays him, but the doctor tries to welch on the deal. Mike smashes his hand in a desk drawer to get the key. It has HAC stamped on it. They drive over to the Hollywood Athletic Club. Mike has to get tough with the attendant (Leonard Mudie). The attendant tells him it is a locker key and escorts Mike to Nicholas Raymondo's locker. Inside the locker is a leather covered box that Mike notices is very hot to the touch. He opens it slightly and an intense light shines from it. It burns his wrist. He tells the attendant not to touch it. When Mike returns to the car, Lilly Carver is gone.At his apartment, Pat and three policemen are waiting for his return. Pat demands the key. Mike confronts Pat with Pat's complicity in all the deaths and his inability to protect all the people who were killed. When he mentions Carver, he is told Carver was killed over a week ago. Then who was that woman? Pat notices the radiation burn on Mike's wrist. Mike gives Pat the key. The police depart. Mike calls the Hollywood Athletic Club, but there is no answer. The locker is broken open, the attendant is dead and the box is missing. That evening Mike makes another call on Ray Diker. He gets another name, William Mist, owner of Mist's Gallery of Modern Art. Mike breaks in but Mist (uncredited) takes a hand full of sleeping pills, prescribed by Dr. G.E. Soberin. Mist is unable to tell Mike anything, despite being slapped around. Mike does manage to get Soberin's location through his answering service. On a hunch he goes to the beach cottage and recognizes the place from his encounter with Evello, Charlie and Sugar.Dr. Soberin (Albert Dekker) is packing to leave. He talks to Lilly Carver, whose real name is Gabrielle and we learn she was employed by Soberin to get the key from Christina and keep an eye on Mike Hammer. Gabrielle wants her share, half, and before Soberin leaves. When Soberin brushes her off she kills the doctor. With his dying breath he begs her not to open the box. Mike enters the room and gets a bullet for his trouble. He demands to know where Velda is located. Gabrielle opens the box and is immediately consumed by fire. Mike comes to and exits the room. He finds Velda in a locked bedroom, frees her, and they leave the house. They run along the beach, occasionally looking back at the strobe effects lighting up the house and beach. They make their way into the surf as the house explodes. We close with Mike and Velda in the surf watching the house disintegrate."

The denizens of Antek's Tug `n' Maul Tavern, Frankie's favorite bar, are pleased to see Frankie, especially his best friend, ""lost dog finder"" Sparrow (Arnold Stang). Although Frankie's former drug supplier, ""Nifty"" Louie Fomorowski (Darren McGavin), offers Frankie a free ""fix, Frankie refuses and vows to Sparrow that he has kicked narcotics for good and intends to become a drummer for a big-name band. Frankie proudly shows off the drums he was given at the hospital, and after sending Sparrow to find him some new clothes, goes to the rooming house where he lives with his wheelchair-bound wife Zosch (Eleanor Parker). The neurotic Zosch, determined to keep Frankie with her by whatever means necessary, has manipulated him for three years by playing on his guilt over causing the accident that injured her while he was driving drunk. Zosch is dubious about his plans to become a musician and urges him to return to dealing poker for Zero Schwiefka (Robert Strauss). Frankie's consistent method of dealing has earned him a city-wide reputation as ""the man with the golden arm,"" but Frankie is determined to improve his life so that he is not tempted to return to drugs. Frankie calls Harry Lane (Will Wright), a musical agent referred to him by his doctor at the narcotics hospital, and makes an appointment to see him. After Sparrow returns with a ""borrowed"" suit for Frankie to wear, they stop at Antek's for a drink and there run into Schwiefka. Frankie announces his intention to quit dealing, and the angry Schwiefka notifies ""Cousin"" Kvorka (Harold 'Tommy' Hart), a local beat policeman, that Frankie and Sparrow shoplifted a suit. Kvorka takes the pair to police captain ""Record Head"" Bednar (Emile Meyer), who wearily ignores Frankie's protests that he has a job interview and insists that he be locked up. Schwiefka then offers to bail out Frankie and Sparrow if Frankie returns to deal for him, and Frankie is forced to accept. Disturbed by a jailed junkie's tormented plea for a fix, Frankie returns home, where Zosch is pleased that he is going back to dealing cards. That night, Louie's taunts about Frankie's shaking hand unnerve the dealer and he leaves to visit the Safari Club, a nearby strip bar where Frankie's former sweetheart, Molly Novotny (Kim Novak), works as a b-girl. Although Molly and Frankie are still in love, Frankie's guilt over causing Zosch's paralysis have kept them apart. Frankie tries to tell Molly that she should leave her current boyfriend, the chiseling, alcoholic Drunky John (John Conte), but Molly states that she needs someone to stave off her deep-seated loneliness. Soon after, Frankie has an interview with Lane, who promises to call him with an audition for a band, but warns him that if he backslides even once, Lane will no longer sponsor him. Despite Frankie's happiness, Zosch nags at him that he is being unrealistic in striving for a better life. A week passes without word from Lane, and Frankie sinks into depression, until one afternoon, Frankie runs into Louie and, succumbing to temptation, accompanies Louie to his apartment for a fix and Frankie is hooked again. Later, after yet another quarrel with Zosch, Frankie storms down to Antek's. There he meets Molly, who encourages him to call Lane, telling him that Lane probably lost his phone number. Molly proves to be correct, and Lane arranges for Frankie to audition for Shorty Rogers' band on the coming Monday. Frankie then pleads with Molly to let him practice playing his drums in her room, as the spiteful Zosch has forbidden him to do so at their place. Although she is reluctant to encourage Frankie's hopes of building a future for the two of them, Molly agrees. After bragging that he has quit Schwiefka and joined the musicians' union, Frankie promises Molly that he is going to kick drugs again, and that after he has made some money and can send Zosch to a clinic, they will be together. Meanwhile, Schwiefka and Louie search for Frankie, as they have used Frankie's reputation to lure two big-time gamblers, Markette (George E.

After Zosch urges Frankie to deal the big game and tears up his musicians' union card, Frankie seeks refuge at Antek's, where Louie offers him some of the profits if he will deal for Markette and Williams. Desperately needing the money, Frankie agrees, and again gives in when Louie tempts him with another fix. Frankie then goes to the Safari Club, where a disappointed Molly berates him for getting high. When Frankie gets in a fight with John, Molly hurriedly leaves the neighborhood without telling Frankie where she is going. Later, Frankie deals the game for Markette and Williams, and with his skill easily wins. After dealing all night, an exhausted Frankie insists on leaving, but when he arrives home, he is suddenly overwhelmed by the need for a fix and rushes back to Schwiefka's. Louie refuses to give Frankie any drugs unless he resumes dealing, because Markette and Williams have begun to win. The game continues, and soon it is early Monday morning. Louie promises Frankie that if he cheats and wins, he will give him a fix, but Frankie, weary from his long hours of dealing, becomes careless, and Williams spots his card-palming and beats him. After Louie then refuses to give Frankie any drugs, Frankie knocks him out and searches his apartment, to no avail. Frankie then goes to his audition but cannot play competently due to his withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, Louie regains consciousness and goes to the rooming house to exact his revenge upon Frankie. Instead, Louie accidentally enters the room as Zosch is walking and deduces that she has been pretending to be paralyzed. When Louie threatens to reveal her secret, the hysterical Zosch pushes him down the stairwell to his death. Frankie, not knowing of Louie's death but fearing that he is after him, runs away and finds Molly, whom he begs for help. Molly then learns from John that Frankie is Bednar's main suspect. Molly then agrees to help Frankie quit drugs cold turkey, so that he can go to the police sober and withstand questioning to prove his innocence. After an agonizing few days, during which Frankie suffers great torment, he is free of his craving. John sees Frankie in Molly's apartment, however, and alerts Bednar. Frankie leaves before Bednar arrives, and Molly takes the police captain to Zosch's, where Frankie is telling her that he is going away with Molly. Just as a terrified Zosch gets up from her wheelchair to chase after Frankie, Bednar and Molly arrive, and they all realize that Zosch must have killed Louie. Before Bednar can arrest her, Zosch runs out to the fire escape and falls to street below. Frankie rushes to the street, where Zosch lays dying, and holds her as she tells him she loves him. After Zosch dies, Frankie and Molly slowly walk off together, leaving their old life behind."

This is an excellent family film with plenty of action, great dialouge and laughs."
tt0048380,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'War']","In the waning days of World War II, in the South Pacific, the men of the Navy cargo ship USS Reluctant are hard at work moving supplies and resupplying other ships of the U.S. Navy. The men are led by Lt. (j.g.) Doug Roberts, who is well-liked by the entire crew and acts as a liaison between them and their captain, Lt. Cmdr. Morton, who is a mean-spirited, exacting and tyrannical officer. Recently the Reluctant was recognized for moving the most cargo of any resupply ship in the fleet. The reward for their efforts is a single palm tree, which was really given to Morton. The tree is displayed proudly on the foredeck by Morton.The result of the recognition is that the Captain has become more tyrannical than ever. He stolidly refuses to let the crew have a standard liberty and micromanages Roberts' duty to keep them engaged while they complete their missions.Roberts feels that, knowing the Pacific war is winding down, he'll never have the chance to serve in naval combat. He's also become quite fed up with the Captain's oppressive attitude and has written a number of letters to the Captain requesting transfer to a combat vessel -- requests that have gone unfulfilled by the Captain.Doug's closest friends on the ship are Ensign Frank Thurlowe Pulver and the ship's doctor, known as ""Doc"". Though he likes Pulver immensely, Roberts is quick to point out that Pulver isn't a very effective leader and is a disorganized person in general. Pulver despises the Captain as much as the rest of the crew and talks often about schemes to annoy the Captain but never follows through on them. When he meets the Captain face-to-face one day he cowers before him.The ship is due to make port at a small Pacific Island, one where there is a full hospital. Pulver sees his chance to find a pretty nurse and possibly woo her. He invites her to tour the ship, however she brings her assistant nurses with her, ruining any chance Pulver has at romance.Roberts goes over the Captain's head and requests liberty for the crew. The Captain allows the ship to make port at Elysium, an island tropical paradise but announces that the liberty has been cancelled. Infuriated, Roberts storms into the Captain's quarters and demands to know why liberty was cancelled. Morton tells Roberts a bit of his own history. He was a busboy for several years and received poor treatment from his customers. He then became a ship's steward and the poor treatment continued. He sees Roberts, a college graduate, as representative of those who treated him badly as a youth and now seeks to pay them back.Before he grants the crew liberty, the Captain demands that Roberts quit his efforts to obtain a transfer and that he become a model officer, essentially becoming a more by-the-book leader and working the crew to their limits. Roberts reluctantly agrees and the Captain allows the crew to go on liberty.That night the crew become highly drunk, raucous and destructive on the island. Many of them are arrested and brought back to the ship by Army MPs (in some cases, Roberts lets them go right back out again). The men break into the home of the French Colonial governor and wreak havoc there. A small detachment of Army MPs show up and form a cordon around the ship, preventing any other men from leaving. The commanding officer has requested that Morton see the Rear Admiral stationed on the island in the morning.Morton returns from his meeting furious -- he and the crew have been ordered to leave port immediately. He commands Roberts to make good on his promise of becoming a stricter officer, which Roberts does. When one of the crew, Dolan, approaches Roberts with what may be good news -- that officers that have a requisite number of months experience may apply for transfer uncontested -- he viciously puts Dolan on report. Upset that he'd had to enforce discipline when a crew member didn't deserve it, Roberts talks to Doc. Doc tries to reason with Roberts, who stops short of revealing the deal he'd made with the Captain. Just then, Pulver bursts in with the news that Germany has surrendered in Europe. Roberts is overjoyed about the news and Pulver tells him he'll celebrate by putting a powerful firecracker under the Captain's bunk. However, while he gathers his explosives, they go off in the bowels of the ship, causing the laundry to become flooded with soap suds. Roberts is still overjoyed, thinking that Pulver can make another firecracker, however, all of Pulver's supplies were destroyed in the accident. Roberts is very forgiving of Pulver and goes out to be alone on the deck.On the deck, Roberts listens to the radio broadcast of the Victory in Europe celebration coming in from New York City. The broadcast then changes to a man giving an inspirational speech about how the war isn't over until the free world stands up to stupidity and arrogance. Roberts is moved by the speech and marches up to the Captain's palm tree, salutes it and throws it overboard. When the Captain finds out, he sounds the ship's general alarm which musters the crew to their battle stations. When they've all assembled, he demands to know who discarded his palm tree. After having his adjutant read the muster list, he determines that Roberts is the culprit. Roberts is called to the Captain's room, but before the Captain can even charge him with the crime, the Captain is overcome with nausea. Roberts calls in Doc to help the Captain, who vomits into his own wastebasket. Doc puts the Captain in his bunk to relax. As Roberts walks down to the deck, the crew, knowing that he discarded the palm tree, all salute him and politely bid him goodnight.A few days later Roberts is packing his things. The Captain has approved a transfer for him and he'll be going to the front line in the Pacific. Before he leaves, Dolan informs him that the Captain has replaced the palm tree and has put a 24-hour guard on it. As he gets ready to meet the transfer vessel, a few of the crew give Roberts a medal they'd made, a gaudy brass palm tree hanging from a ribbon. Roberts is overcome with gratitude, pins it to his shirt and walks with dignity out to the boat that will take him off the ship. He salutes the entire crew and leaves.Several weeks later, Pulver has taken up Roberts' duties as deck officer, managing the moving of cargo. A few of the crew approach him and tell him that the Captain has cancelled the movie that was to be shown that night. Pulver reluctantly tells them he'll do what he can. The ship's mail arrives and Pulver receives two letters. The first he reads is from Roberts, who seems happy that he's finally in the war and that his unit has been involved in a number of air raids. He talks about the brave crew that served him on the Reluctant and the ridiculous ribbon they gave him. The second letter is from a friend of Pulver's who is serving on the same ship as Roberts and has become friendly with him. Pulver's friend writes that their ship suffered a surprise attack and that Roberts was killed while drinking coffee. Pulver is overcome with grief. The Chief Petty Officer want to post the letter to inform the crew of Roberts' death. Doc stops the CPO and tells him to post the letter that Roberts wrote, saying ""it belongs to them"".Pulver suddenly becomes enraged and marches up to the palm tree, grabbing it and throwing it overboard. He continues to the Captain's quarters, banging on the door until he's told to enter. Angrily confronting the Captain, he tells him that he threw the palm tree overboard and demands to know why the movie has been canceled for the evening. The Captain groans knowing that he'll have the same trouble with Pulver that he did with Roberts."
tt0048393,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'FilmNoir', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","Prologue: (narrated by Orson Welles) A small airplane with no one on board was flying along the Mediterranean coast near Barcelona . . . Opening shot shows an empty airplane in flight.Credits roll.At night, between the containers on a Naples pier, first we see a man running, then another, staggering, (Gregoire Aslan), who falls and we see a knife plunged on his back. Guy Van Stratten (Robert Arden) and his girlfriend Mily (Patricia Medina) happen upon the wounded man, and at once offer to stay with him and call for help. The dying man says no, no police, as I am dying anyway, in thanks for being good to me, listen, before I die I will give you some names that are worth millions. Find Gregory Arkadin, tell him you know about me, Bracco, and also about Sophie. In the confusion and noise of arriving police, Sophie's last name is garbled as Bracco dies.Guy is arrested for tobacco smuggling and put in prison for three months. Upon his release, he and Mily resolve to find out why that combination of names is valuable.Gregory Arkadin (Orson Welles) is a multimillionaire business magnate whose whereabouts are known, so Guy and Mily proceed to Cannes, but Arkadin has an enormous staff of bodyguards in charge of keeping riffraff away, so Guy can't get to him. Guy gets lucky as someone points out Arkadin's pretty daughter Raina (Paola Mori) to him. As he approaches, she is talking to her constant companion, the Marquess of Rutleigh (Jack Watling) and he says he is afraid to meet her father. Guy politely interrupts the conversation saying he would love to meet her father, and his daring strikes a chord with her, although she rebuffs his advances and warns that she is constantly watched by a large team of her father's employees.Guy has a conversation with Mily, telling her he will follow Raina and make advances to her in an attempt to get to Arkadin. Mily is a voluptuous cabaret entertainer who finds gigs easily, so she will try to become an entertainer for Arkadin, who throws big parties all the time.Guy keeps tailing Raina, finds out she will be driving to Spain, and persists in talking to her until she lets him ride along. On the ride, he is charming and she begins to fall for him.At their destination [Segovia], where Arkadin resides in the spectacular castle [the Alc√°zar], Guy manages to continue courting Raina while seeing the sights and observing a night parade of black-hooded men doing penance. As he kisses her and she warns that her father will destroy him if he is proved a fortune seeker, he vows he will never ever ask her to marry him. This enhances his attractiveness to Raina.Mily, meantime, sees enough that she feels jealous. If Guy is trying for a relationship with Raina, she will try for a relationship with Arkadin himself.Soon after at a masquerade ball at the castle, Guy enters as a guest and Mily has wangled a singing gig. As Guy enters, the camera follows him and the scale and magnificence of the party are a shocking display of wealth.Guy finally meets the mysterious billionaire Gregory Arkadin, and after a few remarks Arkadin leads him into Raina's cavernous bedroom to talk. He tells Guy he loves his daughter intensely and will do anything to protect Raina from unscrupulous, shady suitors. He shows Guy a dossier on his life, labeled Confidential Report, where Guy's many previous run-ins with the law and other unflattering facts are detailed. Guy is not intimidated but challenges Arkadin instead, claiming that if someone were to investigate Arkadin in a similar way, plenty of dirt would show up, and he himself would not look good.After an instant of reflection, Arkadin offers Guy a deal, that he investigate Arkadin's past and prepare a confidential report on him. Arkadin claims he had amnesia and knows nothing about his own life up to the time when he found himself wandering in Zurich during the winter of 1927 carrying a briefcase with 200,000 Swiss Francs. After some arguing, Arkadin agrees to pay expenses plus fifteen thousand dollars at the conclusion.Raina comes into the bedroom, and asks questions. In the upshot, Arkadin promises not to interfere with Guy's relationship with Raina as part of the deal.With the names and the year 1927 as the only clues, Guy seeks out people who might have some knowledge of Arkadins life. First, The Professor (Mischa Auer) a tall, cadaverous, impoverished Russian owner of a flea circus, who sits alone in a tiny room caring for the repulsive insects, feeding them on his own thin arm, and looks attentively through a large magnifying glass at the probing investigator. Next, a very eccentric antique dealer (Michael Redgrave) scrabbling about an enormous shop filled with junk, authentic and fake. Finally a bookmaker, who gives him the crucial name of a Baroness Nagel who runs a boutique in Paris and might know something.Arkadin not only has periodic contacts with Guy but also has his network of informers reporting Guy's activities. Arkadin arranges a dinner with Baroness Nagel (Suzanne Flon) in which he finds out that the baroness used to work undercover for the Warszaw police and that she was instrumental in disbanding the prostitution and white slavery operation of a certain Sophie, whom she recognized years later as a customer that came into her Paris boutique. Sophie travels to Paris every year for purchases in her shop, from her home in Mexico, where she lives with her now husband, a General Martinez.In the meantime, Mily has been with Arkadin on his boat. Acting on her own, she reveals to Arkadin some of what she knows from her contacts with Guy, in a scene in the rocking boat. She is stumbling around the room, giggling and taunting Arkadin as the camera captures the rocking of the boat and mirrors the shakiness of her drunken state.Guy finds Sophie's first husband, Oscar, a drug addict, living on a small boat. But Oscar gives no useful information despite Guy's maintaining him in withdrawal symptoms until he talks.The mystery of Arkadin's early life is resolved in Guy's meeting with Sophie (Katina Paxinou) in Mexico. She had led a criminal gang in Warsaw in the old days together with Arkadin,. With Brocco, Oscar, Jacob Zouk, they ran a white slavery racket out of a dance studio, using poor and naive girls wanting to become ballet dancers as prostitutes. When the operation was broken up by the police the group was run out of Poland, with Arkadin ending up in Switzerland in the winter of 1927. Sophie admits she was madly in love with Arkadin. He was then Arthur Bahzi and shows Guy photographs to prove it. She says that the two hundred thousand Swiss Francs were hers and that he disappeared with them. Later in life she recognized him at a casino where he was having a good run. Unknown to him, she bet on his numbers and made a small fortune that made up for the stolen money, with interest, so she saw no reason to stir trouble, and decided to leave him be.Guy receives a call from Arkadin, who, it turns out, is staying at the same hotel in Mexico. Guy reports some of what he knows and says he is returning to Europe to meet with Jakob Zouk, the last member of the group, who has just come out of jail in Munich.Before Munich, Guy meets Raina. Meanwhile, Arkadin is back and there is another lavish party . Guy asks about Mily, and Arkadins staff show him a police document -- it seems that Mily has drowned off the coast of Mexico. Guy gets a sinking feeling, asks to call Sophie, but finds that she, too, is dead, as well as Oscar.Guy then realizes that all of Arkadins old gang are being murdered, one after another, that Jakob Zouk is next, and that Mily was murdered because she knew some things, so he will be murdered last, to ensure there will be none to talk of Arkadin's earlier life of crime. Raina will thus be protected from potential blackmailers, from those who might have a moral claim on the fortune built from the stolen 200 thousand Swiss Francs, and her opinion of her father will be untainted by knowledge of his sordid past..Guy, in a panic with the conviction that he's last on the murder list, as insurance for his own life, rushes to Munich to find Jakob Zouk (Akim Tamiroff), the last member of the gang, to hide him to keep him alive. Guy finds Zouk on Christmas eve, a decrepit old man shivering in a garret, with his memories almost totally gone, and unable to react to warnings that he may be killed. Zouk insists he won't say anything unless he gets his Christmas meal of goose liver with mashed potatoes and apples and onions. When Guy returns with such a meal, which he gets through the inflluence of Arkadin, he finds Zouk dead.Guy now expects to be arrested by the Munich police for murder. He has a chance to stay free and alive only by telling Raina about her father's past before the Arkadin organization can stop him with his own death. He attempts to lose Arkadin by mingling with a Christmas service crowd in a large church. Somehow he makes it to the airport to get on a plane flying back to Madrid with a stop in Barcelona.Arkadin follows him, there are no more seats in the plane, and no passengers are tempted by his last minute offer of large amounts of money to relinquish one seat. Guy gets on the plane while Arkadin fumes at the airport.Arkadin secures another airplane, which he flies, trying to beat Guy. By only a few moments, Guy gets to Raina first, and tricks Raina into telling her father by radio, while he is still on the plane, that he has talked to Guy and that he is too late, even though Guy has revealed no details as yet. The radio goes silent.Raina realizes that the phrase too late has triggered her fathers suicide, and she leaves the airport in the company of her previous suitor, the Marquess of Rutleigh."

Carmina y Jorge se quedan a cenar en la fiesta con Mar√≠a Jos√©, as√≠ que llaman a do√±a Mar√≠a. Do√±a Mar√≠a dice a Juan que √©l podr√≠a ir a la fiesta. Carmina se queja en la fiesta diciendo que Juan es un desastre, que nunca quiere hacer nada, lo que es una pena, porque si trabajase m√°s Jorge podr√≠a ayudarle a llegar muy lejos. El gracioso de la fiesta suelta un discurso que nadie se toma en serio, pero que despu√©s aparece como una noticia en el NODO. Juan en el cine ve ese discurso durante la cena, con todos los comensales ya sentados. No le gusta la noticia y se sale del cine, a fumar.Mar√≠a Jos√© le pide a Miguel que la lleve con √©l a su viaje de negocios. √âste no se opone, pero es al final Mar√≠a Jos√© la que da marcha atr√°s.

Ella sabe que no se merece ese suspenso, y que la suspendi√≥ Juan, no el catedr√°tico. Juan le dice que recurra al claustro.

La botella que tira Rafa, algo menos borracho, enlaza con la que tiran los estudiantes rompiendo un cristal de una ventana del decanato de la universidad.El decano (Jos√© Prada) est√° interrogando a Juan, mientras que los estudiantes se manifiestan en su contra. La raz√≥n es la injusticia en la nota con Matilde. El decano aconseja a Juan hablar con su cu√±ado para que lo apoye. Matilde lamenta todo el jaleo que se ha montado con su nota. Juan dice que algunos de ellos est√°n ah√≠ para montar jaleo, pero que otros s√≠ que realmente est√°n preocupados por la situaci√≥n de Matilde. Juan dice que el hecho de que tuviese que ir a buscarlo la polic√≠a - el decano no lograba dar con √©l - lo hab√≠a asustado much√≠simo.

tt0048424,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'FilmNoir', 'Thriller']","Night of the Hunter opens in the stars, where Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish) tells the children (and the audience) a Southern Gothic parable regarding the importance of childhood and the dangers of ""wolves in sheep's"" clothing.Several children play hide and go seek near a farmhouse. One of the kids finds a prime hiding spot: the cellar. However, when he opens the door, the twisted legs of a young woman appear on the top steps. Miles away, the perpetrator, Reverend. Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) drives a stolen Model-T as he talks to the Lord about his earthly mission. He feels convinced that he is being led to punish some of the most wicked segments of society - ""vain women"", who use lust to ensnare men. At a peep show, Powell's disdain grows evident as his knuckles clutch his thigh - the words ""LOVE and HATE"" tattooed on his fingers. His weapon of choice, a switchblade rips through his pocket as the woman performs her striptease. However, the police stop the Preacher for car robbery, and he is charged with a thirty day stay in Moundsville Penitentiary.In another part of town, little John (Billy Chapin) and his young sister Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce) play in their front yard; Pearl dresses her doll, Miss Jenny. Their father, Ben Harper (Peter Graves) rushes to the lawn clutching wads of money: $10,000. He has stolen the money, and is on the run from the police. Harper hides the money in a secure location off camera. He forces John to swear to protect his sister, and to never reveal the location of the money. As the police arrive on the front lawn to arrest his father, John clutches his stomach, ""Don't...don't!"" He exclaims.Ben Harper is tried, and sentenced to be hanged for murder. Awaiting his execution, he is incarcerated with Harry Powell, who learns of Ben's financial gain. While Ben does not disclose the location of the money, Powell thanks the Lord for giving him the opportunity to find Ben's future widow and supplying him with funds.The town's children taunt John and Pearl by singing a hangman's song. They draw chalk outlines of hangmen. Ever vigilant, John takes Pearl away from the school, stopping to admire a watch at the store, and continuing home past the local ice-cream parlor, Spoons. Despite the temptations of the watch or candy, John resists the urge to spend the money, and makes Pearl swear not to reveal the location. In Spoons, Willa (Shelley Winters) the mother of John and Pearl, talks about how she is not in any rush to marry. A train ominously steams towards the town - bearing the now freed Reverend Powell.That night, John tells Pearl a story about a King, who is captured leaving his son and daughter gold and orders to defend their treasure. As he tells the story, the foreboding silhouette of Reverend Powell almost supernaturally appears in their bedroom. He ominously sings the hymn ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms."" The next day, John visits his friend, an outsider living in a house boat named Uncle Birdie. Uncle Birdie had been working on repairing Ben Harpers river skiff.John arrives at Spoons where Reverend Powell tells Icey (the store proprietor), Willa, and Pearl, how he had ministered with Ben Harper in his final moments. He explains the meaning of the tattoos on his fingers. His left hand has the word ""HATE"", and the right hand, ""LOVE."" They are in a constant struggle against each other since the fall of man, with ""LOVE"" winning out over all. Icey invites Reverend. Powell to come to the town picnic. John immediately dislikes the Preacher.At the picnic, Icey attempts to play matchmaker between Willa and the Reverend. He reassures Willa that Ben told him the money was at the bottom of the river. John knows this is a lie. That night John walks home from a visit with Uncle Birdie - the skiff not yet repaired - past the ice cream parlor. He sees his mom and Icey, ebullient over something. When he returns home, Reverend Powell corners him in the cramped hallway. Powell tells John that he is going to become his father and tries to convince him to reveal the location of the money. Pearl wants to tell; she has grown an affinity towards Powell.On the night of the honeymoon, Willa wears a neglige and tries to sleep with the Reverend. Powell humiliates her, forcing her to look into the mirror. Powell emerges from the darkness, illuminates himself for a minute, turning on a naked bulb, and once again floods the room with darkness as he chides her lust. Willa looks into the mirror uttering, ""Help me to get clean.''On the newly repaired skiff, Uncle Birdie and John are fishing. Birdie reassures John that if John is ever in trouble, he can come for help. That night, it is Willa, fanatically leading a revival meeting, testifying how Reverend Powell had saved her. The torches in the foreground illuminate her zealous face. The next night, Pearl is cutting paper dolls out of the money. It is revealed that the money was hidden in her doll, Miss Jenny. John quickly scolds her for playing with the money, but is interrupted as Rev. Powell appears in the doorway. The two children are able to hide the money, and Powell does not notice the paper dolls swirling next to his feet.Willa's trust begins to split as she realizes that Powell has been questioning John. Powell manipulates Pearl into coming to the parlor to tell him the location, Willa hears the exchange outside of the window as Powell gets increasingly violent. She cannot accept this turn of events, and lies in bed helplessly. She deludes herself that they are a happy family. In their bedroom, which looks church like due to the shadows and triangular architecture, Powell slits Willa's throat. John is awakened that night by the sound of a sputtering engine.The next morning at Spoon's, Powell is devastated that his wife Willa had ""run away."" He claims that Willa had turned him down on their honeymoon night, and was a drunk. He decides to stay for the children. The truth is revealed, as the camera transitions to a beautiful shot of seaweed swirling under water, mingling with Willa's hair. Willa sits serenely underwater in the passenger seat of her car as light streams over the body of both the woman and the car. A fish hook tugs on the frame of the windshield. It is Birdie, who has discovered the remains.An iris shot reveals Powell calling for the children, as he moves into the house. Pearl and John hide in the cellar. Reverend Powell corners them, until Icey arrives with dinner for the trio. When she leaves, Powell deprives them of dinner until they tell him what he wants to know. Uncle Birdie is convinced that if he tells, he will be accused of murder. He begins to drink.When Rev. Powell threatens Pearl with a knife, John lies and says that the money is hid under a stone in the basement. Powell lights a candle and leads the children into finding the money. When he discovers that the floor is made of concrete, he grabs John the hair and threatens to split him open like a pig. Pearl spills the secret, but John knocks a shelf of preserves onto Powell. The kids run out and lock him in the cellar. They run to the drunk Uncle Birdie who is non-responsive. John puts Pearl in the boat, with Rev. Powell hot on their heels. As the little boat gets away, Powell lets out a shriek of anger and frustration. As the boat floats down the river, Pearl sings to Miss Jenny. Many woodland animals appear in the foreground of the camera. Powell has commandeered a horse, making his black preacher's suit look even more menacing contrasted with the white steed. The kids beg door to door, finding refuge in a barn. As the crescent moon rises high in the sky, John spots the Reverend singing his trademark song: ""Leaning. Leaning. Leaning on the Everlasting Arm...""The two run back to the boat where they are found by Rachel Cooper, a woman who has adopted many abandoned children at the turn of the depression. She bathes the two children, and incorporates them into her large family, relating them to the story of baby Moses - an orphan in a basket rescueed by the daughter of Pharaoh. John likes this comparison - he realizes he can trust Rachel. The oldest child of Ms. Cooper's clan, Ruby, has a rebellious streak, going off to town to flirt with the boys. When Rev. Powell appears in town to woo her, she is ironically inspired by the preacher, and feels compelled to confess her wrong doings to Rachel.Powell rides to Cooper's ranch where he comes to reclaim Pearl and John. Pearl runs to hug him, but John is able to grab the doll before Powell can get his hands on it. Cooper forces Powell off her property with a shotgun. That night, Powell intimidates the family by singing on Cooper's front porch. The ""Leaning"" duet between Cooper and Powell symbolizes the standoff. When the light goes out, it becomes clear that Powell is inside the house. When a cat scares him, Cooper wounds him with a shot, cornering him in the barn. That night, John sleeps at Rachel's feet.When Powell is arrested, John has mixed feelings. As the police tackle Powell to the ground, John once again clutches his stomach, and murmurs ""don't!"" He then runs towards Powell, beating him with the doll, throwing the money at the arrested clergyman.Icey leads a fiery lynch mob against Reverend Powell, but even in court, John will not point out his mothers murderer - afraid of the consequence. Ruby is still enamored by the mystique Powell had held over her. While the state guards lead him from the back to avoid the mob, Cooper's children follow her like chicks following a mother hen.It is Christmas in the Cooper home, and John only has an apple to give Rachel. She accepts it gratefully and gives him a watch he had admired in the very beginning of the picture. John and Pearl finally have a safe home."

tt0048545,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'PG13']","Shortly after moving to Los Angeles with his parents, 17-year-old Jim Stark (James Dean) enrolls at Dawson High School. In the opening scene, Jim is brought into the police station for public drunkenness. When his mother, father and grandmother arrive at the police station to retrieve him, conflicts in Jim's family situation are introduced as he explains to the arresting officer. His parents are often fighting. His weak-willed father (Jim Backus) often tries to defend Jim, but Jim's picky and domineering mother always wins the arguments for his father cannot find the courage to stand up to his wife. Jim feels betrayed both by this fighting and his father's lack of moral strength, causing feelings of unrest and displacement. This shows up later in the film when he repeatedly asks his father, ""What do you do when you have to be a man?""The next day, while trying to conform with fellow students at the school, he becomes involved in a dispute with a local bully named Buzz Gunderson (Corey Allen). While Jim tries to deal with Buzz, he becomes friends with a shy 15-year-old boy, John, who is nicknamed Plato (Sal Mineo), who was also at the police station the night of the opening scene for shooting and killing puppies. Plato idolizes Jim as a father-figure much to Jim's concern. Plato tells Jim that his parents divorced several years ago and are never in Los Angeles. His mother lives away in her hometown and never visits, calls or writes, while his father (a wealthy business executive) is always traveling and avoids comming home, leaving only his housekeeper to look after Plato. Plato experiences many of the same problems as Jim, such as searching for meaning in life and dealing with his absent and selfish parents who ""don't understand.""In the school hallway, Jim meets Judy (Natalie Wood), whom he also recognizes from the police station the previous night, where she was brought in for being out alone after dark, who originally acts unimpressed by Jim, saying in a sarcastic tone, ""I bet you're a real yo-yo."" She is apparently the property of Buzz. Judy too has an unhappy homelife when it shows her before going to school when she deals with her unattenative and sexist father who gives all his attention to Judy's younger brother as well as ignors both Judy and his wife for he feels that women are ment only to serve him, and nothing more.That afternoon, Jim goes on a field trip with his science class to the Griffith Observatory. At the Planetarium, he watches a dramatic presentation of the violent death of the universe. After the show, he watches Buzz and his thugs slash a tire of his car for no reason, and then Buzz challenges him to a knife fight, while the gang taunts Jim as a ""chicken."" Jim reluctantly takes part in the fight and wins, subduing Buzz by holding his switchblade up to his neck before discarding both knifes off a railing. Both Jim and Buzz get slight injuries during the knife fight. Not to be outdone, Buzz and his thugs challenge Jim to a ""Chickie Run"" with Buzz and Jim racing stolen cars towards an abyss. The one who first jumps out of the car loses and is deemed a ""chicken"" (coward).That evening, the ""game"" is held with Judy and several students in attendance to watch. But the race ends in tragedy for Buzz when a strap on the sleeve of his leather jacket becomes looped over a handle on the car door, preventing him from jumping out before the car goes over the cliff.Jim runs home and tries to tell his parents what happened, but quickly becomes frustrated by their failure to understand him and storms out of the house. Jim goes to the police to find the sergeant who took his statement the previous night to tell him about the accident involving Buzz's death, but learns that the police officer is not there. Jim refuses to speak to any policeman and will speak only to the sergeant and he leaves. But Jim is spotted leaving the station by three of Buzz's friends, Crunch (Frank Mazzola), Goon (Dennis Hopper), and another one of Buzz's gang members whom is not named. Mistakenly thinking that Jim told the police about the ""Chickie Run"", they decide to hunt Jim down to ""silence him""... permenently.Jim meets up with Judy and they go to an abandoned mansion to hide out. Plato finds them there (he was the one who told Jim about the house). There they act out a ""fantasy family,"" with Jim as father, Judy as mother and Plato as child. However, Crunch, Goon, and the other boy soon discover them, and terrorize Plato who finally brandishes his mother's handgun that he took from the house, shooting Crunch, and at Jim, and a police officer who investigates, in a clearly unstable state.Plato runs and hides in the Observatory, which is soon besieged by the police. Jim and Judy follow him inside, and Jim convinces Plato to lend him the gun, from which he silently removes the ammunition magazine. When Plato steps out of the observatory, he becomes agitated again at the sight of the police and charges forward, brandishing his weapon. He is fatally shot by a police officer as Jim yells to the police, too late, that he had already removed the bullets. Plato was wearing Jim's jacket at the time, and as a result, Jim's parents (brought to the scene by police) think at first that Jim was shot. Mr. Stark then runs to comfort Jim, who is distraught by Plato's death. Mr. Stark promises to be a stronger father, one that his son can depend on. Thus reconciled, Jim introduces Judy to his parents and they drive off together as dawn starts to break."

tt0048651,"['History', 'Thriller']","The film was made after a real-life affair which shook the Austro-Hungarian realm at the eve of the Great War.
Oberst (Colonel) Alfred Redl (Balser) heads the military intelligence department of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. He leads a rather lavish life - more than than he would be able to afford from his salary, and even has a young male all-too-close friend (Werner), whom he supports; the young officer even blackmails the colonel by the threat to create a huge scandal by revealing their affair to extract even more money from him.
A series of letters from the Russian Empire, sent poste restante to somebody in Vienna, alerts the Police.
In fact, the real-life Redl had revealed Austrian army's mobilization and deployment schemes to Russia and had cashed in sums about ten times as high as his regular pay, causing huge damage, which would cost thousands of lives of Austro-Hungarian soldiers just a little more than a year later.
Finally a shadow of suspicion falls on the high officer, who is in such an important and knowledgeable position. But the Police miss the person, who picks up the latest letter from Russia, by the blink of an eye. Redl, however, gives himself away by a silly lapse in the ensuing chase.
As this is an affair of state and in those class-conscious days a higher officer is not just an ordinary citizen, the case is not left to the police; instead, a delegation of high-ranking officers turns up at Redl's hotel room and places a pistol in his hand, indicating, ""you know what you have to do""."

Set in 1955, when the Cold War is rapidly heating up, SAC has been formed to provide the ultimate deterrent to World War III. By building up a powerful force of nuclear-armed bombers and keeping them on a war-ready status at all times, SAC's leader, Gen. Hawkes (Frank Lovejoy) hopes to keep the ""enemy"" from starting another devastating conflict. Unfortunately, he is forced to recall reserve pilots and crew from their private lives in order to fill his needs.Holland, promoted to Lt. Colonel, grudgingly accepts the assignment, along with some other equally unhappy airmen, many of whom are old acquaintances from bomber missions flown over Tokyo in 1945. Holland's wife Sally (June Allyson) is less than pleased with the turn their life has taken, and isn't happy about her husband being sent out on dangerous missions when there isn't even a war going on. Also, she soon discovers that she's pregnant, and though she tries to support her husband's efforts to do his job, Holland is soon torn between his sense of duty to his men and country, and his responsibilities to his wife and family.Holland flies missions in the massive B-36 ""Peacemaker"" bomber, a plane that can take off from its base in Texas and fly non-stop to Alaska and back while carrying a crew of a dozen men and more destructive power than a thousand WW-2 bombers. Over the next few months, Holland helps form SAC into a tightly run, well oiled machine, but it means long stretches away from Sally; she's come to dread the sound of the phone ringing, fearing it will be terrible news about Dutch.Holland is flying a cold-weather test mission over Greenland at -40 degrees when his plane's fuel tank seals fail, and the fuel sloshing around in the left wing starts a fire. Nothing they can do will extinguish it, and Holland orders the crew to bail out. Realizing he's too low to bail out himself, he rides the big plane down to a belly landing on the snow, and spends days trapped in the plane's wreck before rescue arrives. Meanwhile, Sally has given birth, and is overjoyed to hear that her husband is alive with only a twisted shoulder for an injury.Returning to duty, Holland is shown the newest addition to SAC's inventory: the futuristic B-47 Stratojet, a sleek, swept-wing jet plane that looks like nothing Dutch has ever seen before. Gen. Hawkes wants Col. Holland to head up the new Stratojet bomber force, but Sally has different plans. Wrangling an opportunity from Dutch's old boss with the Cardinals that she knows he will take, he can finally leave the Air Force behind. Joyfully presenting this to Dutch that night, she is dismayed to see that he has been thinking about his duty to SAC, and has decided to stay. He tries to explain his reasons, his belief that he's doing something far more important than he's ever done, his desire to serve his country and protect his family by staving off war, but Sally is heartbroken, and Dutch must leave on yet another mission.Still bothered by his shoulder injury, Holland leads a massive deployment of the entire wing to Japan, a tremendous undertaking designed leave no doubt in an enemy's mind about what SAC can accomplish. It will also stretch SAC to its limits, and push everyone to the breaking point. Sally tries to speak to her husband one last time before he takes off, but she's too late. Flying non-stop to their base in Japan, Dutch keeps track of all his planes and people, and manages to get everyone there safely, but when it's his turn to land the field is socked in with fog, and Dutch can barely move his right arm. With the help of his co-pilot, he manages a hair-raising blind landing, and collapses from exhaustion.Grounded by his shoulder, Gen. Hawkes is finally forced to release Holland from the Air Force. But before he leaves, he tells Dutch just how much good he has done for SAC. The example he set for his men, staying in even when he had every reason to leave, has done more good for the force than he can imagine.

Still, when the police arrive at Bertani's restaurant, Foussard's teenaged daughter Danielle (Brigitte Auber), who has apparently enjoyed flirting with Robie in the past, spirits him across the bay in a motorboat to the safety of a Cannes beach club.Robie enlists the aid of an insurance man of Bertani's acquaintance, H.H. Hughson (John Williams) of Lloyds of London, in order to prove his innocence. Robie's plan is to catch the new cat burglar in the act.

After Arnie rushes off to get his mother, retired seaman Captain Albert Wiles, who has been unsuccessfully hunting rabbits, cleans his rifle. Having shot a beer can and a ""no shooting"" sign, Capt. Wiles is lamenting his luck when he stumbles across the corpse. Fearing that his third shot killed the man, who has a wound on his forehead, Capt. Wiles searches his pockets and finds a letter identifying him as Harry Worp of Boston. As Capt. Wiles is dragging Harry away to bury him, he is stopped by spinster Miss Ivy Graveley, who calmly asks him what the trouble is. Miss Graveley, who was out for a walk, is unperturbed by Capt. Wiles's situation, and agrees with him that he should bury Harry without involving the authorities, as the death was accidental.Miss Graveley leaves after inviting Capt. Wiles for tea later that day, but before Capt. Wiles can begin digging, Arnie returns with his mother, Jennifer Rogers. The captain quickly hides behind a tree, and is pleased to hear Jennifer, who recognizes Harry, express delight that he is dead and instruct Arnie to forget that he saw the body. After Jennifer and Arnie leave, Capt. Wiles is forced to continue hiding when Dr. Greenbow, engrossed in a book, wanders by but does not see Harry, and a tramp also comes by and steals Harry's shoes.While the captain falls asleep, in the village, eccentric painter Sam Marlowe cheerfully reprimands Emporium store owner Mrs. Wiggs for not being able to sell his abstract paintings at her roadside stand. While the pair are inside the store, however, they ignore a millionaire, who has stopped while driving by and wishes to buy the paintings.Soon after, Sam walks through the woods with his sketchbook and comes across the dead body, of whom he draws a portrait. The captain wakes up and explains his situation to Sam, who reluctantly agrees to help him bury the corpse, provided that Jennifer does not intend to notify the police. Capt. Wiles decides that Sam is right and goes off to dine with Miss Graveley while Sam introduces himself to Jennifer, whom he has admired from afar. Jennifer calmly takes Sam's unusual manner in stride and explains that after her first husband, Arnie's father, died shortly after their marriage, she learned that she was pregnant. Harry, the older brother of Jennifer's husband, decided that it was his duty to marry her, and although she did not love him, Jennifer agreed for the sake of her child. On their wedding night, however, Harry never came up to their hotel room, and Jennifer learned that he had read an ominous horoscope, advising him not to undertake any long-term projects. Repulsed, Jennifer left Harry, changed her name and moved to Vermont. That morning, however, Harry found her and insisted that she return to him because he was lonely. Refusing, Jennifer hit him over the head with a milk bottle and the dazed Harry wandered off. Theorizing that Capt. Wiles's shot finished off Harry, Sam asks if Jennifer minds a quiet burial for Harry, and Jennifer gives her assent.Meanwhile, the flirtatious captain is enjoying his luncheon with Miss Graveley when Arnie arrives with a dead rabbit, which Capt. Wiles happily realizes he shot that morning. Capt. Wiles then joins Sam in the woods, where they bury Harry in a huge hole. After they are done, however, Capt. Wiles deduces that he could not have shot Harry if his third and last shot felled the rabbit instead, and persuades a tired Sam to dig up Harry so they can examine him. Upon looking closely, Sam decides that Harry died from a blow to the head and wonders if Jennifer killed him. Determined to protect Jennifer, Sam and the captain again bury Harry.Later that afternoon, Capt. Wiles talks with Miss Graveley, who confesses her fear that she killed Harry during her morning walk in the woods. She describes how the addled Harry, believing that she was his wife, dragged her into the bushes, and she stunned him with a blow to the head with her sturdy hiking shoe. Despite the captain's misgivings, Miss Graveley insists that she must tell the authorities, and they go to the woods, where they dig up Harry.Meanwhile, Sam is at Jennifer's house, where the couple admits that they are comfortable together, despite having known each other for only a short time. Their conversation is interrupted by Capt. Wiles and Miss Graveley, who arrive covered with dirt and tell them of Harry's latest dis-internment. The group then concludes that Harry should be re-buried, so that the details of Jennifer's marriage to him will not become public.After burying the body yet again, the quartet is returning to the village when Mrs. Wiggs tells them that the millionaire has come back and wants to buy Sam's paintings. In the store, Sam refuses the millionaire's offer of money and instead asks his friends what they want. Upon agreeing on fresh strawberries every month for Jennifer, a chemistry set for Arnie, a cash register for Mrs. Wiggs, shooting clothes for Capt. Wiles and a hope chest for Miss Graveley, Sam whispers his own request to the millionaire. After the millionaire and his chauffeur leave, Calvin, Mrs. Wiggs's son and a deputy sheriff, arrives with the news that he found the tramp with the stolen shoes. The quartet beats a hasty retreat, but after they depart, Calvin finds Sam's sketchbook with the portrait of Harry, which matches the tramp's description of the corpse.Meanwhile, at Jennifer's house, Jennifer agrees to marry Sam, which delights everyone until they realize that she cannot legally marry again until she proves that Harry is dead. Dragging themselves back into the woods, the friends dig up Harry and are startled by the sudden appearance of Dr. Greenbow, who believes that they have just come across Harry and agrees to examine him at Jennifer's house. There, the friends are attempting to clean Harry so that the doctor will not suspect that he has been buried several times already when they are interrupted by Calvin. They quickly hide Harry in the bathtub and scatter his clothes around the house, after which a suspicious Calvin interrogates Sam. Sam casually manages to alter his drawing so that it no longer resembles Harry, and as the doctor arrives, Capt. Wiles steals Harry's shoes out of Calvin's car so that Calvin will not have any other evidence.After Calvin finally leaves, the friends are astounded when Greenbow announces that Harry died from a heart attack. Once the doctor departs, the friends decide to take Harry back to the woods and have Arnie, who has a tenuous grasp of the passage of time, discover him again, so that they can alert the police. In the morning, the quartet watches as Arnie finds Harry, then rushes off to get Jennifer. Before they disperse, however, Capt. Wiles questions Sam about his request from the millionaire, and Sam happily reveals that he asked for a double bed.The film closes with the text proclaiming: ""The Trouble with Harry is over""."

By 1984, London, with its bomb-proof ministry, was designated as the capital of Airstrip One, a province of Oceania.In the spring of 1984, as the sound of air raid sirens wail above the London streets, Winston Smith (Edmond O'Brien), a member of the elite Outer Party, takes cover in a doorway and there encounters Julia (Jan Sterling), a woman he suspects may be a member of the Thought Police. After the air raid sirens abate, Winston goes to his apartment, where an electronic surveillance eye examines the contents of his briefcase. Smuggling a small black diary past the eye, Winston begins to write down the subversive thoughts he fears to say aloud. Winston's reverie is interrupted when Selina Parsons (Carol Wolveridge), the little girl who lives next door and is training to become a spy for Big Brother, enters his apartment to practice denouncing him as a traitor. After his daughter heads off for her spy indoctrination, Parsons (Donald Pleasence), Selina's father, invites Winston to join him at the local Chestnut Tree caf√© for some tea.At the cafe, Winston and Parsons spot Rutherford and Jones, two traitors who have been rehabilitated by the government's Ministry of Love. After Big Brother impulsively orders Rutherford and Jones's re-arrest, Winston, rattled, goes to a junk shop to wonder at the beauteous objects of yesteryear that are now deemed worthless. As the elderly proprietor (David Kossoff) shows Winston his wares, Julia enters the shop, sending Winston scurrying into the street, where he is stopped by the police and ordered to report to Administration the next morning.At the Administration the next day, a party officer reprimands Winston for mixing with the common masses (the Proles). Winston then proceeds to his job at the Records Department, where he revises history to vindicate Big Brother's pronouncements. When Winston discovers a photo that would prove Jones and Rutherford innocent, O'Connor (Michael Redgrave), Winston's superior and a minister of the exclusive Inner Party, instructs him to destroy it.That evening, at a political rally to foment hate against Eurasia, Julia passes Winston a note professing her love to him. Later, they arrange to meet Sunday in a meadow, far from the prying microphones and monitors of Big Brother. There, they touch each other, an act prohibited by the Anti-Sex League and proceed to make love (off-camera).Two weeks later, Winston and Julia meet clandestinely at a bell tower, and Winston proposes renting a room at the junk store, one of the few places free of the omnipresent monitors. The elderly proprietor honors their request and sets up a cozy bedroom and kitchen for them. In the sanctity of their quarters, after Julia removes her austere party uniform and dons a frilly blouse, Winston confides that he believes O'Connor may be a member of the Underground.One night, while leafing through his diary, Winston finds a note written in O'Connor's hand that reads ""down with Big Brother."" The next day at work, O'Connor tells Winston to come by his apartment that evening to pick up some documents. Convinced that O'Connor represents their only hope to break free of the tyranny of Big Brother, Julia and Winston go to his apartment and declare that they want to join the Underground. After drinking a toast to the demise of Big Brother, O'Connor asks if there is anything they would not do for the Underground and Julia replies that she would not be separated from Winston. O'Connor then instructs Winston to carry an empty briefcase with him at all times.During a rally to launch Hate Week, a man in the crowd switches briefcases with Winston, and when Winston opens the case, he finds a copy of a treatise by Calidor, the alleged leader of the Underground. Back in their secret room, Julia muses that only love can defeat Big Brother and thus provide hope for the future. At that moment, a telescreen hidden behind a mirror breaks its silence to condemn Julia's sentiments, after which, the police, accompanied by the elderly proprietor, burst in to arrest them.At the Ministry of Love, Winston is confined in a pit-like room for hours (and probably days). Soon after, Parsons is thrown into the pit, his daughter having denounced him for muttering in his sleep ""Down with Big Brother."" Under O'Connor's direction, Winston is subjected to a brainwashing campaign. Still resistant after a series of electroshock treatments, Winston declares that the party will never eradicate his love for Julia. O'Connor then ushers Winston into the dreaded Room 101, where each prisoner must confront their own personal terror. Having ascertained that Winston's worst fear is being eaten alive by rats, O'Connor confines him in a room filled with the squealing rodents, after which he breaks down and begs them to feed Julia to the rodents instead. His will broken, the door opens and Winston falls sobbing into O'Connor's arms.After O'Connor authorizes his release, Winston mindlessly wanders through the streets, where he spots Julia, her eyes vacant as his, seated on a bench. After they confess their mutual betrayal, Big Brother broadcasts that the Eurasian army has been routed.

tt0048947,"['Biography', 'Drama', 'History', 'Romance']","This is an example of a weak British play turned into a much-admired Oscar and Bafta winning movie by screenwriter Arthur Laurents, director Anatole Litvak and composer Alfred Newman. Russian emigres living in Paris and Copenhagen ten years after the Tsar was executed during the First World War were historically drawn into an extortion scheme to draw on one of the family's unclaimed ten million pound bank accounts in the form of war reparations. .Yul Brynner is a player in the extortion scheme. As the group's window of opportunity to cop the lolly is drawing to a close, he boxes homeless woman, Ingrid Bergman, into being the claimant asking for fiscal executorship to draw on the ten million pound bank account. Because the players and their sycophants do not seem to be able to generate the legal paperwork to prepare the civil suit to claim the lolly, the second half draws into it a recluse widow played by Helen Hayes, whom they believe will be able to sort it out. What none in the group, least of all Yul Brynner, expects is that two of Hollywood's most admired stars, Ingrid Bergman and Helen Hayes, are given character blocking to exhibit loose cannon personalities who purposefully blow everything up at every turn, and also light up the screen with heart-rending performances as foils to Brynner's charismatic presence and powerful gut determination to extort money. Following their powerful confrontations which take up much of the second half, Bergman and Hayes disappear from the action to prepare, offscreen, a formal diplomatic reception to which the press will be invited to witness Hayes' proclamation of support for Bergman's civil suit petition to cop the ten million pound lolly so Brynner can distribute some of it to each cohort. Everyone gets a surprise when Bergman and Hayes slyly reveal their own counterplan to spoil everything and carry it off with aplomb, even if the denoument was not very well written in the play. Bergman quietly disappears into anonymity because her identity as a homeless woman is not yet established. Hayes informs her sycophants that she merely plans to make a grand entrance, then curtly command everyone to go home because there is no civil suit."

His love remains strong, and so does hers; after one more attempt to resist him, she agrees to drive down to Mexico with him and get married overnight.They honeymoon for a week, and soon Millie becomes concerned when some details that Burt mentions about his past begin changing. Those concerns are minor compared to the arrival of his first wife, Virginia, whom Millie did not know existed. Since Burt is not there, Virginia asks Millie to have him sign the final documents from their divorce making Millie realize she is a party to bigamy-- and alludes to his troubles with compulsive lying. She also mentions Burt's father, who is not dead as Burt claimed but visiting L.A. at the time.Millie goes to visit Burt's smarmy father, who further alludes to his son's frustrating mental troubles, but can not explain them. Millie does not know, however, that Virginia is also staying in his hotel room, and the two of them are clearly carrying on a long-term sexual relationship.Millie confronts Burt about his lies, and as she moves on to discuss his father, he grows more irate. She nonetheless convinces him to go visit his father at the hotel, and secretly follows him. There, Millie sees that Burt's father and Virginia are in fact canoodling, but she is too late to stop Burt from seeing they are sharing the same room.Millie brings Burt back to their apartment, and he is understandably devastated. Burt's dad and Virginia soon arrive and Millie confronts them with the truth of their terrible deception and disregard for Burt. Millie realizes that they are trying to coerce Burt into the divorce so that he will sign away his deceased mother's valuable property to the two of them.After sending away the scoundrels without their desired legal documents, Millie tries to explain the situation to Burt. Alas, Burt escalates to such a level of anger and paranoia-- believing that Millie is in cahoots with his dad and ex-wife in the scam-- that he slaps Millie and ultimately tries to slam her typewriter on her, which lands on her hand.While Millie seeks treatment for her injuries from the beating, a doctor recommends that she should consult a psychiatrist about Burt. She goes to visit the pompous shrink, who insists that Burt needs months of institutionalization, regardless of whatever the hell is wrong with him. Millie remains faithful that somehow she will not need to make that choice.Within a short time though, Burt has such terrible episodes that Millie signs for him to be committed, and two guys in white jackets come to forcibly take him away to an asylum. While he is there, the authorities subject him to multiple shock treatments and force abundant drugs into him, and Millie waits for months with a guilty conscience, worrying that Burt will not be cured, and accepting that if he is, he will no longer want to be married to her.After the many months go by, Millie is ordered to pick up Burt at the sanitarium, but she only wants to appear briefly to release him and wish him well as he moves on. When they meet, Millie blathers on again for some time about how she is too old for him, and now that he is well he can get on in life with a younger woman. As she walks him off the grounds, he asks her to show him the hand that he smashed with the typewriter-- an incident he had repressed in his previous mania. She lifts her hand and he kisses it, then they deeply kiss each other. Someone walking by gives them a long critical look, which they notice, but they agree they do not care what other people think.They walk off into the falling autumn leaves (with Nat King Cole singing along)."

tt0048977,"['Drama', 'Horror', 'Thriller']","Lovely, well-to-do Christine Bravo Penmark has everything: a loving, well-paid husband with a respectable career (as an Air Force colonel, no less), a swank apartment in a respectable part of town, and an adorable, cherubic eight-year-old daughter. But as Col. Kenneth Penmark leaves for an assignment in Washington, DC, the strains that have lurked beneath the surface of the Penmark household now begin to manifest. For example, her daughter Rhoda gives every indication of being a grasping, greedy child, whom their landlady, Monica Breedlove, indulges with extravagant presents that Rhoda gives some indication of not being satisfied with. For another, Rhoda protests loudly and resentfully when reminded that she had lost a penmanship competition, saying that she ought to have won first place, and the medal that goes with that honor.The apartment-house handyman, Leroy, presents another complication. Though an adult, he seems to have an eight-year-old mind himself. He is also mean and spiteful, and regularly spars with Rhoda.Rhoda leaves for a school picnic, wearing two shoes that have been modified with iron plates to make them sound like tap shoes. As she leaves, Leroy sprays her shoes with the garden hose, earning a stern reprimand from Monica. Leroy nurses resentment of Mrs. Breedlove, a lustful attitude toward Christine, and a clear enmity toward Rhoda.At the picnic, Christine tries to sound out Claudia Fern, the headmistress of Rhoda's school, about how Rhoda is fitting in and getting along. Miss Fern at first is effusive in her praise of Rhoda but then becomes evasive and abruptly excuses herself. Christine confesses at this point that Rhoda seems overly mature for her age, in a ""disturbing"" manner.That afternoon, Christine entertains her ""psychiatry club,"" at which Monica fairly boasts of having been under analysis by some of the most droppable names in the profession of psychiatry. (That she could actually have been a patient of Sigmund Freud, as she boasts, is a stretch, and her fellow clubbers seem to know it.) Then, as the club starts to discuss a case of a recently convicted serial murderess, Christine finds the conversation disturbing, prompting Monica to tease her about it. The conversation then continues onto the case of one Bessie Denker, a name that Christine recognizes but won't elaborate on.In the middle of this conversation, someone turns on the radio, and the announcer gives a shocking report: that Claude Daigle, a fellow student of Rhoda's, has drowned on an old, rickety pier that the students had been forbidden to play on or near. As expected, the school bus brings Rhoda home early--and Rhoda, far from being in any to-be-expected state of shock, seems to care nothing about the death of her classmate, and casually asks for a peanut-butter sandwich and a glass of milk, and then goes out roller-skating. The one adult who takes the most notice of Rhoda's casual attitude is the handyman, Leroy. He says flat-out that she's not even sorry that he died, and Rhoda half-innocently, half-sardonically asks why she should feel sorry. As she skates away, Leroy forms a resolve to find something to scare her with, thinking only as an eight-year-old thinks, to ""take her down a peg.""A few days later, Claudia Fern comes to visit Christine, and to reveal some startling information: that Rhoda was the last student to see Claude Daigle alive, and that Claude's penmanship medal, which he had worn to the picnic, was now missing. Miss Fern also reveals that Rhoda had been pestering Claude all morning, trying to snatch his medal from him. Furthermore, Miss Fern reveals that a lifeguard had shouted a warning to a girl answering to Rhoda's description, as she was coming off the wharf.Christine now remembers that Claudia Fern and her sisters never asked Christine to pay for a share of the flowers for Claude Daigle's funeral, and Miss Fern states that she thought that Christine would prefer to send flowers individually. Now Christine asks flatly why Miss Fern would take that attitude, and ask Christine Penmark about the missing medal. In reply, Miss Fern reveals what she had earlier not wanted to discuss with Christine: that Rhoda has no sense of fair play, is a sore loser, and has earned the enmity of all the other pupils in the school. Furthermore, Miss Fern announces that Rhoda will not be welcome when school takes up again in the following fall. This prompts Christine to ask Miss Fern flat-out whether she supposes that Rhoda had anything to do with Claude's death. Shocked, Miss Fern disclaims any such suspicion, but her behavior indicates that, whether she harbored such a suspicion or not, her sisters do.Their conversation is interrupted when Hortense Daigle, the dead boy's mother, stumbles into the apartment, drunk and barely able to walk in a straight line, followed closely by Henry Daigle, her embarrassed husband. Mrs. Daigle sarcastically observes that Christine is her social superior, an ""honor"" that Christine hastily disclaims, and then comes to the point of her visit: she demands to know what became of the penmanship medal, and what Miss Fern, concerned as she probably is with liability issues, won't reveal. Mrs. Daigle also reveals that Claude, when found, had bruises on his hand and a crescent-moon-shaped wound on his forehead. In the end Mrs. Daigle becomes terrifically angry, and then almost collapses in tears, allowing her otherwise-ineffectual husband to lead her away. After Hortense leaves, Christine and Miss Fern have a tearful parting. Shortly after this, Col. Penmark calls to ask about the accident, and to reveal that his Washington assignment will last at least another four weeks.When Monica calls and asks Christine to lend her a locket that she had given Rhoda, so that she can have its gemstone changed, Christine is horrified to find the penmanship medal in Rhoda's little ""treasure chest."" She then shows the medal to Rhoda and demands that Rhoda explain how she came by the medal. Rhoda at first tries to change the subject, then denies that she had had the medal, then tells a variety of stories that Christine recognizes as false almost at once, and finally says that she had somehow persuaded Claude to let her hold the medal, and then had gone out onto the pier and fallen in later on. In between these activities, Rhoda indulges in a bit of flattery that now seems anything but flattering. Then Christine recalls a fatal accident that had happened to a neighbor in Wichita, KS, an accident by which Rhoda came into possession of a keepsake belonging to the neighbor. Christine finally announces her intention to call Miss Fern, intending to surrender the medal, but Rhoda, in a frightened tone, begs her not to, saying that the school officials don't like her and were persecuting her. Miss Fern is not available, and Rhoda seems to care most of all about retaining the medal, insisting that she, not Claude, had actually earned it.Back in Washington, Col. Penmark buys an expensive children's tea set for Rhoda and has it shipped to Rhoda, packed in excelsior. Rhoda goes out to play with it, and takes the packing material with her. Leroy sees her at play, and begins his scare campaign by accusing her of beating Claude Daigle with a stick and saying that she could never clean a murder weapon enough to remove all trace of blood, that the police have ""stick bloodhounds"" that can find a thrown-away stick in any forest, and that the police laboratory will sprinkle ""blood powder"" on a blood-soaked stick and make it turn blue. Rhoda, for her part, gives Leroy the excelsior, saying that she knows about the bed of excelsior that Leroy has made for himself so that he can sleep on the job in the furnace room without being caught. Nor is she afraid of Leroy's accusations, saying that he made them all up. Christine catches Leroy talking to Rhoda and warns him never to speak to Rhoda again, or she will report him to Monica Breedlove.When Rhoda comes back into the house, she asks her mother about police tests for blood. Christine offers to ask Miss Fern about it, but again Rhoda does not want Christine to ask Miss Fern any such thing. Christine instructs Rhoda to go up to Mrs. Breedlove's apartment for dinner, while the famous psychiatrist Reginald Tasker dines in the Penmark apartment with the local ""psychiatry club."" Mr. Tasker reveals that he has great respect for Christine's father, Richard Bravo, who had been quite an authority on crime and criminals in his younger days. Tasker and Bravo engage in good-natured professional sparring, and also discuss Christine Penmark's own dreams of writing a murder mystery. Christine asks Tasker whether children ever commit murder, and Tasker says that they do, and even that many adult criminals begin their careers in childhood. Christine insists that criminals are made in bad environments, but Tasker insists that some criminals are born that way, that they are ""bad seeds,"" possessing atavistic, consciousless minds, and even that one might inherit a tendency to criminality. Richard Bravo refuses to accept such a theory, but Tasker politely stands by his theory, and even states that a child criminal would not present a sour countenance at all, but would instead present a quite convincing ""normal"" and ""innocent"" manner.Then the conversation turns to the case of Bessie Denker, one of Richard Bravo's own case-history subjects. Bravo wants to avoid the subject, but Christine insists, and Tasker reveals that Ms. Denker vanished without a trace before the authorities could make an arrest. Tasker even remembers that Ms. Denker left a child behind, a part of the story that Bravo hastily denies. Shortly after making this revelation, Tasker leaves.Now that Christine and her father are alone together, Mr. Bravo challenges Christine with the worry that shows plainly on her countenance. Now Christine starts to talk freely of her fear of having been an adopted child, and not the actual daughter of Richard Bravo and his wife. Christine also says that her concerns about Rhoda have prompted a return of her old fear. She mentions a recurring nightmare that she had always talked to Richard about, but Mr. Bravo clearly does not want to discuss it, and especially does not want Christine to lend credence to the inherited-criminality theory.But now Mr. Bravo reveals that he did find Christine in ""a very strange place."" Then Christine reveals her recurring nightmare, about living in a farmhouse with her brother and a very beautiful lady, then not having a brother anymore, then being terrified of being in the room, then being outside in an orchard. Finally she remembers the name she originally had: her name was not Christine Bravo at all, but Ingold Denker, Bessie Denker's daughter.This, then, is the truth: Richard Bravo found Ingold Denker, whom he renamed Christine, in the orchard on the Denker farm after Bessie Denker had died. But Christine now feels that she would have done better to die, because she is afraid that she inherited a tendency to extreme criminality from her real mother, Bessie Denker--and passed this on to her own daughter, Rhoda Penmark.At this moment, Monica Breedlove returns with Rhoda. Rhoda greets her grandfather cheerfully, but now Richard Bravo takes a long, hard look at his granddaughter, though he will not explain his misgivings. Bravo agrees to stay in a spare room in Monica's apartment overnight.Later, Christine catches Rhoda trying to dispose of something in a paper bag. Rhoda doesn't want to reveal the contents of the bag, so Christine struggles with Rhoda and forces her to reveal what she had been trying to dispose of: her shoes with the iron half-moon reinforcements. Now Rhoda knows the horrible truth and extracts a confession from her: that Rhoda killed Claude Daigle by beating him with her toe shoes, after he had refused to let her handle his penmanship medal. After the first blow, Claude surrendered the medal, and then tried to escape, and Rhoda struck him again, and again, until he fell in the water. When he tried to climb back onto the wharf, Rhoda beat the backs of his hands with her shoes to make him let go, and so he drowned. Rhoda also confesses something else: that she had in fact deliberately caused their neighbor in Wichita to fall on some ice. Christine, totally distraught, instructs Rhoda to throw the shoes into the incinerator slot and say nothing to anyone. Rhoda again asks about the medal, and Christine half-promises not to give the medal back to Miss Fern.The next morning, Richard Bravo leaves, and Leroy again tries to tease Rhoda. This time Leroy says that if the police find the stick with which she killed Claude Daigle, they'll sentence her to death in the electric chair, and even that the police have his-and-her child-sized electric chairs. Next, Leroy says that he hasn't seen her in her tap shoes, and now says that he knows that she hit Claude Daigle with the shoes, and even that he has retrieved them from the incinerator. That last boast causes Rhoda to take alarm and demand that Leroy return the shoes. At last Leroy has found something to scare her with, and he presses his point--and finally realizes that she really did the deed, and that's the reason why she is scared and is demanding the return of the shoes.In fact, Leroy did not retrieve the shoes when he said he did, but after Christine chases Leroy away from Rhoda a second time, Leroy opens the incinerator and finds the shoes, but is now too afraid to say anything. Christine, for her part, reprimands Rhoda for talking about this subject after they had agreed never to speak of it to anyone.When Monica calls to give Rhoda the locket, after it has been modified, Rhoda asks permission to catch the ice-cream man and buy a popsicle. On her way, Rhoda tries to steal several matches. Christine tells her to replace them, but manages to hide two of them. When Rhoda leaves, Monica probes Christine, knowing that something is troubling her, but not knowing what. Monica offers to give Christine some sleeping pills to help her sleep. Christine collapses in a pool of tears, but still is afraid to tell Monica anything. At that moment, Hortense Daigle, drunk as before, returns to the apartment, seeking yet another confrontation, not only with Christine, but this time also with Rhoda. Hortense has by now tried to talk to Miss Fern a dozen times without result, and has also spoken to the lifeguard from the fatal picnic. What she now knows makes her firmly suspect Rhoda of something, though she is not even sure herself what she suspects. Hortense does not succeed in getting the information she seeks, or in scaring Rhoda (because Monica hastily takes Rhoda away on a pretext). But she does succeed in frightening Christine very badly before her husband finally shows up to take her home again.After Hortense leaves, Christine starts to call Col. Penmark, but despairs of having anything constructive to tell him. Monica returns and reveals that she allowed Rhoda to go out and buy another popsicle. Rhoda then comes back into the apartment, crosses to the music room, and starts again to play her favorite tune, ""Au clair de la lune,"" on the piano over and over--slowly at first, and then faster and faster until she is playing it at break-neck speed. While she is playing, Christine hears a man's voice from below, screaming at the top of his voice for someone to let him out. She then hears a desperate knocking from inside the sloping cellar door, and then sees a cloud of smoke emanating from that cellar. Monica's brother Emory and Mr. Tasker, who is still staying in the house, try desperately to break the cellar door open, but before they can get in, the screams rise to a blood-curdling crescendo and then stop. The owner of that voice was Leroy, who has, quite simply, burned to death.Christine now suffers a nervous breakdown and starts to strike the dining-room table with her right hand and babble about being blind, and finally screams at Rhoda to stop playing that piano tune over and over. When Rhoda does come out of the room, Monica has to restrain Christine from striking Rhoda. Christine then collapses in tears as she confronts the realization that Rhoda has killed yet another person. But Christine blames herself, not Rhoda, because Christine is now fully convinced that Rhoda inherited her murderous tendencies from Christine herself.That night, she induces Rhoda to confess to killing Leroy, which Rhoda does, all the while insisting that the fault was not hers, but Leroy's, because Leroy shouldn't have scared her with his loose talk about police investigations, evidence, and little blue and pink electric chairs for children. Christine reveals at this point that she has dropped Claude Daigle's medal onto the pilings at the pier where he drowned.Finally, Christine gives Rhoda what she says are ""new vitamins,"" but are actually sleeping pills, in an amount that is obviously an overdose. After putting Rhoda to bed, Christine shoots herself with Col. Penmark's revolver that they keep in the apartment. Two days later, Mr. Bravo and Col. Penmark, both returned from their respective cities, discuss the apparent attempt at murder and suicide. Rhoda recovers completely, but Christine must stay in the hospital to recover. Col. Penmark takes Rhoda home, but Richard Bravo asks the hospital doctor whether Christine had mumbled anything while he was attending to her. The doctor remembers that she kept repeating the phrase ""bad seed"" over and over. Mr. Bravo says that Christine was about to write a book about inherited criminality, but the doctor, as Mr. Bravo had done, totally rejects the theory, saying that no one would dare bear or adopt children if that were the case.Col. Penmark puts Rhoda to bed and then waits up. He takes a call from the hospital, as Christine desperately wants to confess to Kenneth that she has ""sinned a great sin."" The colonel says that whatever the problem is, they will face it together.Rhoda, meanwhile, has put on her raincoat and sou'wester and gone out of the house. She walks all the way to the Fern school grounds, and onto the wharf where Claude died. Rhoda wants, quite simply, to retrieve the medal. Using a flashlight, she spots the medal underwater, and takes an old fishing net to try to snag it. Lightning strikes her and knocks her into the water.The movie, as such, ends here--but then a casting-call sequence appears in which the actors playing the various parts introduce themselves. Rhoda appears next to last, and finally Christine--but then Christine steps toward Rhoda, seizes her, turns her over her knee, and gives her a sound spanking. The last frame is a plea to the audience not to reveal the ""unusual climax."""

Before heading for home waters Captain Langsdorff of the Graf Spee decides on one final raid on a convoy leaving from the River Plate in South America. But this move has been anticipated by Commodore Henry Harwood and his squadron of three Royal Navy cruisers Exeter, Ajax & Achilles.The Graf Spee has the much heavier guns and the faster engines so despite explicit orders against engaging with any warships, Langsdorff decides to join battle, hoping to add the sinking of a Royal Navy cruiser to his other achievements. The Graf Spee should have blown the three cruisers out of the water before they landed a shot on her, or just ran away. But with superior tactics the Royal Navy ships do enough damage to the Graf Spee to force her to take refuge in Montevideo, Uruguay. One of the three cruisers, HMS Exeter, is so badly damaged that she limps off to the Falkland Islands to be repaired.Then the diplomatic battle begins. The British want to keep the Graf Spee in Montevideo until enough forces can be mustered outside to attack and sink her. Various diplomatic tricks are used to keep the Graf Spee in the harbour while the two remaining cruisers patrol outside. But when it is clear that the Graf Spee is about to set sail, by a clever bit of deception the British convince the Germans that there is already a large Royal Navy force waiting for her and that the Graf Spee is doomed. Not wanting the ship to be captured they scuttle her in the River Plate."

tt0049013,"['Horror', 'SciFi']","The picture opens with narration over a black screen. Basil Rathbone tells us, ""The ancients who wrote in the sensory tongue made first mention of the strange drug they called Nind Andhera. This drug was first introduced into the city of Lahore in the Punjab in the 703rd year after the death of the Prophet, praise his memory. This drug has the power to place a mans body and limbs into helplessness and his soul sleeps. Nor does he feel pain. He is as a dead man, yet he is not of the dead."" Title and credits follow.A wide shot of Newgate Prison in London in the year 1872 is followed by two guards and Sir Joel Cadman (Basil Rathbone) going to see a prisoner. Dr. Gordon Angus Ramsay (Herbert Rudley) is a condemned man, scheduled to hang the next morning. Cadman was his medical school teacher. Ramsay is chained to the wall. He complains that he was convicted on circumstantial evidence of killing a man named Curry. Ramsay does admit to some of the facts, but does not remember most of what occurred. Most distressing to Ramsay is the fact that after being hanged his body is to be delivered to a medical school for dissection, instead of a proper burial. Cadman assures his student that will not happen. He has interceded with the Lord Chief Justice to get that provision of his sentence rescinded. Cadman is to get Ramsay's body and will be buried properly. Cadman pops the top on his walking stick and pours a small amount of powder into a cup. He instructs Ramsay to take a drink in the morning before the guards come for him. He explains it is only a sedative to help him cope with the ordeal. The next morning in his cell, while the crowd outside gets restless, three men stand next to the dead body of Ramsay. The prison doctor pronounces time of death at approximately 5:00 a.m.Odo the Gypsy (Akim Tamiroff) escorts Dr. Cadman to a room containing a coffin containing the body of Dr. Ramsay. Cadman prepares a syringe and inject the antidote into the arm of Ramsay, which shows signs of rigor mortis. Cadman and Odo hold the body down. Ramsay begins to revive, his body racked with spasms and labored breathing. Cadman informs his student, ""You're dead Dr. Ramsay."" He then reads the Death Certificate to Ramsay. Odo and Cadman lift Ramsay out of the coffin. Cadman reveals that the antidote must be administered within twelve hours or death occurs, and his reason for the rescue from the hangman. Cadman objects to state sponsored murder and that he needs the help of a skilled surgeon. Ramsay voices his appreciation.At St. Griffins, an old abbey on the east coast of England, Cadman and Ramsay arrive by carriage. Casimir (Bela Lugosi) answers the door and takes their hats and coats. An immediate commotion ensues. Laurie Monroe (Patricia Blair as Patricia Blake) runs screaming to Dr. Cadman followed her tormentor, Mungo (Lon Chaney) formerly Dr. Monroe. Mungo approaches dragging one foot and is unresponsive to Dr. Cadman's orders to stop. Mungo pushes aside the two medical men and attacks Laurie. Daphne (Phyllis Stanley), Cadman's nurse appears. She is the only person who has any influence over Mungo. Mungo releases Laurie and takes Daphne's hand then limps away. Cadman escorts Ramsay to his room. Daphne tends to the comatose body of Cadman's wife, Angelina (an uncredited Louanna Gardner). She brushes her hair and takes her temperature. Cadman enters and is briefed on his wife's condition. Cadman tells his nurse he must operate soon. He plans brain surgery to cure the paralysis and coma.The next morning the two medical men have breakfast and discuss the Mungo mishap. Ramsay thinks Mungo looks familiar and is informed that Mungo was a lecturer at the medical college, Dr. Monroe. He suffered a brain disease and Cadman promises to cure him. Cadman then shows Ramsay a diagram of the brain and explains the areas and their functions. The full nature of Ramsay's task is explained, ""The work is too complex for one man. You, doctor, you shall help me complete my chart."" Cadman leads Ramsay through a door at the back of a large, open, fireplace. The secret door leads to an old part of the abbey tower Cadman now uses for his surgery. Daphne and Laurie are already present and preparing a cadaver for surgery. Cadman and Ramsay wash their hands while Daphne finishes shaving the head of K6, a sailor (George Sawaya). Ramsay is under the impression that the sailor is a cadaver, but will soon learn to the contrary. Cadman marks the skull for surgery then begins. He opens a section of the skull and applies electrodes to parts of the exposed brain. The body responds by lifting his right arm, next by trying to speak, and finally by opening his eyes. Cadman cuts a section of brain away which results in the leakage of cerebral fluid. Ramsay now realizes the cadaver is actually a heavily sedated man. Cadman explains that K6 is under influence of Black Sleep and feels nothing. Ramsay is shocked and horrified and expresses his surprise at the callous disregard for human life Cadman shows.Ramsay is in his room when he hears a knock at the door. A note is shoved under the door. He hears Laurie scream in the hall and goes to investigate. Mungo is attacking the woman. Ramsay tries to help and is attacked by Mungo. Daphne appears from her room and saves Ramsay. Returning to his room, Ramsay reads the note and heads for the kitchen. He hides when Casimir appears carrying a bed warmer. In the kitchen, he meets with Laurie. Laurie explains that Mungo is Dr. Monroe, her father. Casimir interrupts the couple to get coals for the bed warmer. Ramsay comforts Laurie, he explains that Cadman will help and operate on her father. Laurie informs Ramsay that Cadman has already operated. Prior to surgery Dr. Monroe was paralyzed on one side of his body, but otherwise normal and kindly towards her, but after surgery the paralysis was cured, except for the foot dragging, but his personality was completely changed. Laurie tells Ramsay there have been other surgeries but she does not know where the bodies have gone.The next morning Ramsay is finishing his notes on the previous surgery. Cadman expresses his appreciation to have a colleague and trained man to assist in the work. Cadman reviews the notes. Ramsay asks Cadman about the surgery on Dr. Monroe. Cadman finally admits that he damaged the reasoning section of his brain. He also admits the sailor is recovering, but there have been changes. Odo makes a call on Cadman to inform him that he is having trouble obtaining another surgical candidate--a woman, the mistress of Curry. Ramsay is tormented by his work and sleeps fitfully.In London, a woman calls on Odo at his studio. Carmona Daly (Claire Carleton) has come in regards to some work. Odo explains that he is in need of a model, but she expresses reluctance to prostitute herself. Odo assures her that he only wishes to sketch her face. He drugs her, but before he can make transportation arrangements the police pay a call on the studio. Sgt. Steele (an uncredited Peter Gordon) and Roundsman Blevins (an uncredited Clive Morgan) search the studio, with Odo's permission. They are looking for Miss Daly in regards to the Curry murder case. She had provided some information and is needed for further questioning. Odo decides not to revive Carmona Daly and disposes of the antidote.At the abbey, Cadman informs Ramsay that a final experiment, a dual surgery, is to be performed the next day. Ramsay asks Laurie where the post-surgical recovery area is located. She tells Ramsay she does not know. He asks about Curry, but she tells him names are never used, but, ""Dr. Cadman pointed at the big man and said Curry powder comes from India and so does the black sleep, they ought to hit it off."" Ramsay confides his secret and explains he needs to find Curry and alive to free himself. They walk behind the fireplace, but open the wrong door. That passage takes them down into the basement, instead of up to the tower and the surgery. Ramsay opens a locked door and the pair explore. This basement room is the recovery area. They first encounter a very thin man with very long hair. He is named Borg (John Carradine), but he calls himself Bohemond, a crusader. He rambles about the Holy Land. They walk on and find the sailor identified as K6. His face is contorted, one eye closed and skin lesions covering the right side of his face. He begs for help, then tries to kill Dr. Ramsay. Their third discovery is a woman, young Nancy (Sally Yarnell), who laughs maniacally. She is covered in patches of tufts of hair all over her arms and back. Finally, Laurie and Ramsay find Curry (Tor Johnson). Like all the others he is chained to the wall. Curry is now bald, blind and mute. Cadman, Mungo, Daphne and Casimir appear. Ramsay and Laurie are taken out of the basement by force. Curry finds the keys to the chains that Ramsay dropped in his niche. Cadman accuses Ramsay, ""You've been very foolish Dr. Ramsay. Foolish and very ungrateful. I saved your life."" Ramsay demands to be allowed to leave. Cadman refuses. Odo arrives with the dead body of Carmona Daly. Odo suggests Laurie substitute for Miss Daly and Cadman agrees. He will use her during the operation on his wife to avoid sensitive areas of her brain. The police arrive and Casimir is sent to delay their interference. Sgt. Steele presents himself along with Det. Redford (an uncredited John Sheffield) to Cadman. They inquire as to the location of Carmona and Odo, then depart the abbey after Cadman satisfies their questions. Cadman goes to retrieve his wife while Ramsay tries to escape with the now sedated Laurie. He decides to drug Mungo and carry Laurie out. Daphne is attacked behind the fireplace by Borg and the other three basement escapees. Daphne catches fire and runs away. The former surgical patients go up to the surgery. Ramsay administers the antidote to Laurie. Mungo recovers from his anesthesia as Laurie recovers from the Black Sleep. The four former patients enter the surgery and attack Mungo. They dispatch Mungo then turn their attention on Cadman, who arrives with his wife in his arms. Laurie and Ramsay slip past the crowd and escape the room. Cadman is not so lucky. He is chased out of the room and fall off the stairs (no guardrails, remember this is a 10th century abbey). The police are there to greet the pair as they exit the fireplace door. Odo is placed under arrest and taken away. We close with Laurie and Ramsay walking arm in arm away from the abbey."
tt0049019,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'Not', 'Rated']","Written and made in response to the execution by hanging of Ruth Ellis at Holloway Prison, London, England. Miss Ellis was the last woman to be hanged in the UK. The public outcry following her execution helped lead to the eventual abolition of judicial execution in the UK and this film, by keeping the public consciousness alive, in no small way assisted this process.
In the film the Diana Dors character, Mary Hilton, shoots her lovers girlfriend, whereas in real life Ruth Ellis shot her lover. Apart from that the details are almost identical between the fictional and non- fictional lives.
The background is told in flashbacks from the condemned cell as Mary recounts her life of abuse and betrayal of trust by the men in her life. Finally she meets a man that she can really love and trust, but when she discovers his long term girlfriend she shoots her. Tried at the Old Bailey Mary suffers from a poor defense and is sentenced to hang.
The bulk of the story focuses on the psychological effects of her impending execution and the traumas of meeting with family and her failed appeal. This is an inward study and still has the power to upset today, even though there are no scenes of execution.
Looking at the critics appraisals this was Diana Dors' best movie. Although best known for more risque rolls this film shows her true talent and apart from a few TV appearances and a bit of Shakespeare viewers were denied a repeat performance.
PS It is a shame that in some places the film was re-titled from 'Yield to the Night'' to 'Blonde Sinner'. Not only does the poster give the wrong impression of the films content, but the lead character, Mary, recites parts of this titular poem throughout the film, creating some of its most moving moments."
tt0049030,"['Drama', 'Family']","On the day of his wife's funeral, Rafael Rosillo is ordered by Vargas, the chief accountant for Rafael's boss, millionaire ranch owner Don Alejandro Videgaray, to return a cow owned by the ranch. Despite the protestations of Rafael's ten-year-old son Leonardo, who states that Alejandro gave them the cow in gratitude for saving his life, Vargas insists that the ranch owns the cow and its soon-to-be-born calf. That night, a storm awakens Leonardo, who rushes outside to rescue the cow. Although he is too late to save her, he brings back to his bed her newborn calf. While his father and sister Maria admire the calf for his bravery, Leonardo names him ""Gitano,"" meaning gypsy. The boy soon develops a strong bond with the similarly motherless youngster. In school, where he will be the first Rosillo ever to graduate, Leonardo learns about former Mexican president Benito Juarez, who rose from the lower classes but never forgot his roots. After class, the boy asks his teacher, Se√±orita Sanchez, to help him write a letter to Alejandro, reminding him that the cow was a gift. Over the next months, Gitano grows into a fine bull who loves to fight. One day, Rafael spots Leonardo using a red cape while playing with Gitano, and warns the boy not to train the bull to enjoy the cape, or he will become a killer in the bullfighting ring. Leonardo begs his father not to sell Gitano to the ring, but Rafael ignores him, confident that Leonardo will outgrow his childish attachment. Soon after, Vargas insists that Gitano be branded with the rest of the Videgaray herd, and Rafael is forced to assent. When Leonardo hears the news, he rushes to the ranch, shaming Rafael with his tears. Days later, however, Se√±orita Sanchez reveals that a letter has arrived from Alejandro that once again grants Gitano to the Rosillos. On the next holy day, Leonardo brings Gitano to be blessed by the priest, and after the bull kneels before the clergyman, he receives a double blessing. When Gitano is two years old, he is entered in a public test of bravery at Alejandro's ranch. Before the ceremony, Rafael promises Leonardo that if the bull proves himself courageous, the boy can keep him. Meanwhile, Alejandro invites the famous bullfighter Fermin Rivera and an American starlet, Marion Randall, to attend the tests with him. As they drive through the ranch, Gitano attacks their car, impressing them with his spirit. They are shocked when Leonardo, showing no fear of Gitano, forcibly pulls the bull away from the car, then rides away on his back. At the ceremony, Maria frets for the safety of her boyfriend, Manuel, who wants to be a bullfighter. As Alejandro tries to explain to Marion why bullfighting is noble rather than cruel, he is distracted by the sight of Gitano in the ring, easily outsmarting the matadors. Too strong for the local bullfighters, Gitano cannot be contained, and soon tramples Manuel. Leonardo is heartbroken, but as Manuel recovers, and Maria thanks her brother for curing him of his desire to be a matador. Over the next months, while Rivera wins the hearts of the Mexican people with his courage and grace in the ring, Alejandro wins trophies at his hobby, car racing. On the day of Leonardo's graduation, however, as Rafael celebrates in drunken pride, they learn that Alejandro has died in a car crash. The ranch possessions are soon put up for auction, and Vargas, who was impressed by Gitano in the ring, declares that the bull belongs to the ranch, as he bears the Videgaray brand. Leonardo searches for the letter from Alejandro but, unable to find it, is forced to let Vargas return Gitano to the herd. Late that night, Leonardo sneaks into the ranch and calls Gitano to him, then takes the bull back home through the woods. When he stops to sleep for the night, a mountain lion attacks, but Gitano kills it, saving the boy. At home, Rafael chastises Leonardo and convinces him to return the bull to Vargas, who sells Gitano at auction to businessman Dr. Gajona. Upon learning that the bulls will be driven to Mexico City, Leonardo secretly hitches a ride on one of the trucks. In the city, he is amazed by the culture and people, and horrified at the sight of the arena, where Gitano will surely be killed. Leonardo searches throughout the city for Gajona, to no avail. Desperate, the boy stops by a statue of Juarez and, remembering his teacher's words, is inspired to speak directly to El Presidente. He heads to Juarez's home, only to learn that the current president lives in the National Palace. As the fights begin in the Plaza de Mexico, an exhausted Leonardo finally reaches the palace and is allowed to see the president. After hearing the boy's story, the president agrees to write a letter asking Gajona to release the bull. A police escort rushes Leonardo to the arena, but he is too late; Gitano has entered the ring and now fights against Rivera. The fight is long, the bull performing bravely and Rivera fighting valiantly. The matador lances Gitano several times, but cannot kill him, as the bull holds his head too high to allow a stab to hit its mark. The crowd is soon entranced by Gitano, whom the announcer calls ""the noblest bull ever,"" and begins to call for his release. Although no bull has been spared in the ring since 1937, the chant gains momentum, and the officials finally agree. Thrilled, Leonardo hops into the ring and runs toward Gitano. The crowd is horrified, certain that the furious beast will kill the boy, but Gitano approaches his friend peacefully. As Leonardo hugs Gitano, promising him that ""now we can live,"" the crowd roars its approval. AFI"

tt0049083,"['Action', 'Drama', 'War']","In March of 1942, Royal Marine Captain Hugh Thompson reports for duty at the Portsmouth Marine Barracks. Later that day, Marine Acting Major Stringer reports for duty and introduces himself to Thompson. Stringer will command a special unit assigned to travel by canoe up the Gironde River in occupied France to Bordeaux and there to blow up several German supply ships in the docks.Forty-three men arrive to contend for places on the team. All are volunteers for hazardous service, the sort of man of which Thompson is openly skeptical. Stringer begins by interviewing the men, one at a time, asking, ""Why did you volunteer for hazardous service?"" He throws out many obvious rejects and then tests the rest by dropping them by parachute 300 miles north, dressed in German uniforms with neither money nor ID, and telling them to get back to barracks in 48 hours. Eight of the men make it back, and they are the final selection.Stringer now has his crew--but the friction between him and Thompson only grows, because Stringer's methods grate on Thompson's professional sensibilities. The appalling lack of discipline of the men irk Thompson even more, but Stringer insists on doing things ""his"" way.Then comes an exercise to attempt to penetrate the Thames--and not a man reaches his objective, and all of them get picked up within hours. Stringer humbles himself before Thompson, who delivers a bracing lecture on the meaning of command, leadership, and discipline. Stringer takes the hint and retrains his men far more rigorously, with promising results.The operation is approved, and when Stringer and Thompson receive their orders, Thompson suggests that they go get drunk. Alone in a dining room with a bottle of brandy between them, Thompson confesses that he had been disgraced in the Battle of Cambrai and lost his chance to make things up when the war ended. He tells Stringer that he has his chance to be a hero, and not to muff it. Their men take their own liberty in a local pub, and start a brawl with Royal Navy men during which one of them (Marine Ruddock) slips out unnoticed. He is missed the next morning. Thompson, thoroughly angry, confines the other men to barracks and goes after Ruddock personally. He sees for himself that Ruddock's wife is cheating on him, and then finds Ruddock in another pub and tells him to take fifteen minutes and ""do a good job of it; that's an order."" Ruddock, of course, obeys--and his fight with the ""other man"" takes place entirely off-screen, with Captain Thompson and a London ""Bobby"" looking on and agreeing, like gentlemen, to take no official action.Finally Stringer, Thompson, and their men board a Royal Navy submarine and set out for the mouth of the Gironde River. On the last night, a depth-charge attack causes Marine Lomas to injure himself fatally by bumping his head against a metal strut. Thompson pleads with Stringer to let him take Lomas' place rather than idle a canoe, and Stringer reluctantly agrees.The canoes are launched, and the men begin paddling toward the mouth of the Gironde. The heavy seas of the tide race swamp one of the canoes; its crew swim to shore and are captured by the Germans.The leading sergeant has his crewman shot dead at another point on the river; the sergeant takes his revenge by tossing a fast-detonating mine into a patrol boat so that the other three canoes can escape.A third canoe is about to be captured when its crew detonates its fast-detonating mine and blows up all the other mines that they carry.Now two canoes remain, manned by Stringer and Marine Clarke, and Thompson and Marine Ruddock. They reach Bordeaux and attach twelve limpet mines to the hulls of several ships. Thompson and Ruddock are captured by the Germans and interrogated, and tell them nothing. Eventually Thompson, Ruddock, and the original crew who had gotten swamped in the tide race, are shot by a firing squad.Stringer and Clarke are rescued by French fishermen and given disguises in which they start to make their way out of France--after having the chance to witness all those mines blowing up and sinking all those cargo ships. Thus Operation Cockleshell is a success, though at the cost of nine lives. As Stringer and Clarke walk up the road from Bordeaux, nine ghosts briefly join them."
tt0049096,"['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Musical']","During the main titles, Danny Kaye, dressed as a jester, sings the clever song, Life Could Not Better Be, with lyrics that are apropos to the actors or technicians who are being introduced. A narrator introduces the film while the audience sees a cadre of horsemen riding along the English coastline: ""This is the story of how the destiny of a nation was changed by a birthmark, a royal birthmark, on the royal posterior of a royal infant child."" Roderick the Tyrant had killed all of the royal family except for a baby boy who survived and has been cared for by a group in the forest. This band of loyalists to the throne is lead by a Robin Hood-type outlaw, the Black Fox (Edward Ashley). The scene changes to the castle where King Roderick (Cecil Parker) is considering an alliance with Griswold of McElwaine in which the King would offer his daughter, Gwendolyn (Angela Lansbury), as Griswold's bride. Gwendolyn is completely opposed to this arrangement. Back in the forest, the audience is led to believe the Black Fox is singing ""(You'll Never) Outfox the Fox."" He is assisted by a band of midgets, all in Black Fox outfits. However, soon the real Black Fox arrives and we learn that the person who was impersonating the Black Fox is Hubert Hawkins (Danny Kaye), a former carnival entertainer, and the midgets are his pals from the carnival. When the Black Fox reprimands Hawkins for wearing his clothes, he responds that he is only trying to improve the morale of the troops. Maid Jean (Glynis Johns), who is a Captain in the Black Fox's band of outlaws, enters to announce that a group of recruits is arriving. The Black Fox orders Hawkins to get the child - the royal child. Hawkins retrieves the infant and holds the baby on his shoulder to reveal the royal birthmark - the purple pimpernel - for the recruits to see so they will know the Black Fox and his gang are fighting to restore the rightful heir to the throne. The Black Fox orders Hawkins and the Captain to transport the baby to the Abbey in Dover for safekeeping. Hawkins disguises himself as an old man, while Jean transforms from the Captain into a lovely young maiden. They conceal the baby in a fake wine cask. When the King's men stop them on the road, Hawkins claims he is Foutzingdale, the wine merchant, and Jean is his granddaughter. After safely eluding the King's forces, a thunderstorm forces Hawkins and Jean to spend the night in a woodman's hut. Hawkins sings ""Baby, Let Me Take You Dreaming,"" as a lullaby for the baby. Since there is only one straw bed, Hawkins and Captain Jean share it. Hawkins has always been attracted to Jean and she now warms to him. They kiss, but Jean resists. She says, ""We daren't think of ourselves until our fight is won."" Jean reveals to Hawkins the existence of a secret tunnel leading from the forest to the castle. The problem is it is locked at both ends and the key is in the King's possession. However, if they could get someone inside the castle that could access the King's chambers and retrieve the key, it could be opened so the Black Fox's forces could launch a surprise attack against King Roderick. Suddenly, their planning is interrupted by a stranger entering the hut seeking shelter. He introduces himself as Giacomo (David Carradine; Giacomo is pronounced ""Jockamo""), ""King of Jesters and Jester of Kings."" He is headed for King Roderick's court to become his jester. Jean knocks out Giacomo so Hawkins can become the jester. The wicked Sir Ravenhurst (Basil Rathbone) has hired Giacomo as jester because he is also an assassin. So Hawkins assumes the identity of Giacomo and heads for the castle, while Jean and the infant king continue their journey to the Abbey. However, Giacomo's wagon loses a wheel, so he is delayed on the road and Jean runs afoul of the King's men who are scouring the countryside for the fairest wenches in the land. Therefore, Jean and the wine cart with the precious baby hidden inside arrive at the castle before the new Giacomo has finished repairing his cart. Once at the castle, Jean whistles a secret signal. A blacksmith responds to the signal and takes the child to safety. When Giacomo finally arrives, he sings ""My Heart Knows a Lovely Song,"" which includes the whistle signal. When Giacomo hears the signal returned, he thinks it came from Lord Ravenhurst. Meanwhile, Princess Gwendolyn is fretting to the witch, Griselda (Mildred Natwick), about being forced to marry Griswold. Griselda reassures her that she is destined to wed someone else. When Griselda witnesses the arrival of Giacomo, she tells Gwendolyn he is her intended. Ravenhurst introduces Giacomo to the King. Their conversation about the Italian court is a classic Danny Kaye tongue-twister that ends with, ""Yes! The Duchess dove at the Duke just when the Duke dove at the Doge. Now the Duke ducked, the Doge dodged, and the Duchess didn't. So the Duke got the Duchess, the Duchess got the Doge, and the Doge got the Duke!"" The King is on his way to select a wench from those who have been recently rounded up by his men. Ravenhurst convinces the King to allow Giacomo to make the appropriate selection. During all of this, the blacksmith is desperately trying to identify himself to Hawkins as his contact. Shortly after Giacomo is shown to his room, the blacksmith comes there, but is interrupted by the arrival of Griselda. Using her evil eye, she hypnotizes Giacomo. He can be brought in and out of this trance by the snap of a finger. She sends him to make love to the Princess. The blacksmith, who has been hiding behind a curtain, has overheard everything. Meanwhile, Jean has made her way to the King's chamber and has found the key to the secret tunnel. As she is leaving, she runs into Giacomo, who is under Griselda's spell. Jean, unaware of the trance, gives the key to Giacomo. When the King arrives, he thinks Jean is Giacomo's choice from the wenches and immediately takes a fancy to her. Giacomo continues to the Princess' chamber. Gwendolyn discovers the key and assumes he has secured it for their escape from the castle. She keeps the key and gives him her silk handkerchief. In several instances, finger snaps bring Giacomo in and out of the trance with comic results. When he leaves Gwendolyn, Giacomo goes to Ravenhurst's chamber, where again finger snaps cause hilarious results. At one instant he is Ravenhurst's assassin-for-hire, at another he is in Griselda's trance as the super confident romancer, and at another he is Hawkins, the scared former carnival performer. When he leaves Ravenhurst, he returns to his room where Griselda puts him to sleep. Meanwhile, Jean is being dressed by ladies-in-waiting for her presentation to the King. She sends the attendants away when she hears the whistle signal from the blacksmith. She tells him to take the baby to the jester. Once Giacomo awakens, he is the jester again. When he arrives at the King's banquet room, he sees Jean seated next to the King. During this sequence, there is great deal of confusion: the blacksmith delivers the baby to Giacomo in a basket, Ravenhurst confuses Giacomo by talking about Plan 1 and Plan 2 in the assassination attempt, and Gwendolyn tells him to meet her at midnight at the north gate. When he finally realizes that the infant king is in the basket, he diverts everyone's attention away from the basket by singing ""The Maladjusted Jester."" During his performance, Griselda puts poison pellets in three flagons. Just as Jean retrieves the basket and is stopped by some guards, Giacomo proposes a toast to the King. As the guards turn to participate in the toast, Jean gets away. Sirs Brockhurst, Finsdale and Pertwee fall over dead when they drink from the poisoned flagons. Ravenhurst is very impressed by Giacomo's tactics. A page announces the arrival of Sir Griswold (Robert Middleton) at the castle. Jean hands the baby off to the blacksmith again. Griswold enters and accepts the terms of the alliance, but Gwendolyn tells her father she loves someone else and refuses to marry Griswold. She has presented her loved one with her silk handkerchief. Giacomo is arrested and they find Gwendolyn's silk handkerchief stuffed in his blouse. The King throws Giacomo, or whoever he is, in jail. When Ravenhurst learns that Giacomo is an impostor, he suspects he is the Black Fox. He recommends the King knight the jester so he can legitimately joust Sir Griswold. The winner, which should be Griswold, would marry Gwendolyn. The King quickly agrees. It usually takes years to attain knighthood, but Giacomo is rushed through the tests with comic ease. Jean approaches the King in his chamber while his dressers are grooming him. She gets him to dismiss his attendants and while she combs his hair, she retreives the key to the secret tunnel. The King also reveals to her the plans to knight the jester so he can be killed in the fight with Griswold. As soon as she gets away from the King, Jean gives the key to the blacksmith to get it to the Black Fox so he can attack. Just before the knighting ceremony, Jean warns Giacomo/Hawkins about the plot and urges him to run. He doesn't get away, however, and the ceremony begins. It is speeded up with hilarious results to allow the tournament to commence before it can be delayed by a storm that is brewing. Immediately upon being knighted, Hawkins is challenged to a duel to the death by Griswold. Gwendolyn expects Giacomo to be killed, so she warns the witch that if he dies, she dies. Therefore, Griselda puts poisonous pellets in the vessel with the pestle. One of Griswold's men overhears the plot and informs his master. In a scene full of tongue-twisting confusion, the ""Vessel with the Pestle (or The Pellet with the Poison)"" routine begins. Lightning hits Giacomo's suit of armor making it magnetic. During the hilarious joust, Griswold's weapon sticks to Hawkins' shield, so Hawkins pulls him off his horse and wins the joust. When he is proclaimed the winner, Ravenhurst accuses him of being the Black Fox and Jean as being his accomplice. They are arrested and taken to the castle for judgement. In the forest, the Black Fox and his men prepare to sneak inside the castle, but the secret passage collapses. The Black Fox immediately summons Hawkins' midget friends to infiltrate the castle first. As Hawkins and Jean stand trial, the midgets attack. Jean runs to raise the drawbridge so the Black Fox and his men can attack. Hawkins engages Ravenhurst in a sword fight. Griselda hypnotizes him again into believing he is a great swordsman. In the hilarious scene that follows, finger snaps cause him to alternate between a cowardly carnival performer and a master swordsman. Eventually, with the help of Jean, Hawkins bests Ravenhurst. Once the usurpers of the throne are defeated by the Black Fox and the army of midgets, the rightful King is revealed by the distinctive birthmark - the purple pimpernel. Hawkins embraces Jean and sings a reprise of ""Life Could Not Better Be."" As the film ends, Gwendolyn and Griswold can be seen in the crowd holding hands."

We see a montage of UFO sightings including Air force pilots, farmers and civilians. After collecting and examining these reports the military decides they are a threat and orders a shoot on sight orderThenDr. Russell Marvin (Hugh Marlow) and his recently married wife Dr. Carol Marvin (Joan Taylor) are driving through the desert to a rocket testing ground - Project Skyhook, when they are buzzed by a UFO. Although they don't realize it at the time, a recorder used to dictate research notes has picked up and recorded the UFO encounter.General John Hanley (Morris Ankrun) arrives at the rocket range and begins trying to postpone the launch. However Marvin and other scientists advise it is too late to abort the launch. During this conversation we discover that Carol Marvin is his daughter, and although pleased for the couple was unaware of their recent marriage.Rocket 11 launches without incidentThat evening over dinner the General discusses with the Marvins the failure of the previous 10 rockets launched in the program. Dr. Marvin surmises that UFOs might have shot the rockets down; he then reveals the recording he made during his encounter with the UFO. As dinner is finishing the three of them see glowing lights in the sky, Carol explains they are fog lights, and no one knows what they are. A few seconds later the wreckage of rocket 11 enters the atmosphere and burns up.Against everyone's better judgment, it is decided to launch rocket 12. During preparations for the launch a UFO is seen buzzing the rocket range before landing in the middle of the facility. Three suited occupants emerge and are fired upon by soldiers. The aliens retaliate, as one of their group is killed. Returning to their ship with their fallen comrade the aliens take off and begin to systematically destroy the rocket test area, kidnapping General Hanley in the processTrapped below ground by fires started during the attack, the Marvins begin to consider rescue unlikely. With their air running out, they decide to make a recording of the events that led up to the alien attack. The tape recorder they are using starts to lose power slowing the playback down. Rewinding the tape the Marvins realize the noise they heard was greatly sped up message from the aliens asking them to meet at the rocket installation. Dr. Marvin understands that a terrible mistake has occurred and fears what might come of it.To their surprise the Marvins are rescued and race to Washington to reveal what they have learned. The authorities expressly forbid Dr. Marvin from making contact with the aliens. Ignoring this, Marvin does contact them and gets new instructions for a meeting place: a beach on the California coast.Carol and Major Huglin (Donald Curtis) discover his plan and try to stop him, racing to the rendezvous point, where the aliens have already landed. Marvin ignores them and approaches the ship. A voice explains it is safe to enter, which they do.Once inside the ship a disembodied voice explains the aliens' mission. They come from a dying star and need to find a new place to live. They demand that Earth surrenders and let them control of the planet. The aliens then admit they have Carol's father onboard and have sucked all memories out of his brain, reducing him to a zombie-like state. Finally, they give Earth an ultimatum of two lunar months to surrender or they will attack with their fleet. Once this is understood, the humans are released, except General Hanley.Back in Washington, the group is debriefed over events on the ship. Further debate breaks out over exactly how to handle the situation. Dr. Marvin explains given his interactions with the aliens he might have an idea for a weapon that could stop the attack. The military embraces the idea of a weapon that uses sound to disorientate UFOs causing them to crash. With only sixty days to the attack the military begins talking to other nations to help speed up and build enough weapons to fend off the attack.Weeks pass and the development is better than expected. During a final test of the weapon a spy drone sent by the aliens is spotted. During a final test of the weapon, an alien spy drone is spotted observing the area, the scientists destroy the drone, but fear the aliens now have valuable information regarding the weapon and its location.The scientists evacuate but during the final stages of the process an alien ship arrives. Seeing an opportunity the weapon is deployed against the ship. The ray works and the aliens are driven off, but not before one of them is killed and left behind.Opening the alien's suit reveals a highly atrophied corpse, it is thought that the aliens are quiet fragile and need the suits to survive. In a matter of minutes the corpse rots and disappears to nothing. Before any more can be done the UFO returns and destroys the installation where the weapon had been housed. As the UFO leaves after the successful attack, two bodies are seen falling from the craft. One of them is Carol's dead father, General HanleyThe next day further examination of the suit reveals a communication device, with which the military is able to interpret the attack plan of the aliens. It also appears to be able to amplify both sight and hearing. Examining how the attack succeeded the day before, a disadvantage is discovered in that the ray only has a range of 1500 yards.The aliens interrupt the discussion with a worldwide broadcast threatening to manipulate the sun in such a way as to cause severe meteorological convulsions in eight days . The aliens insist that all the world leaders should meet in Washington to discuss surrender termsThe military believes rather than discussing anything the aliens intend to destroy Washington. As predicted, the solar eruption takes place. It is further realized that there are only nine days to prepare, and those preparations are going to suffer due to worsening weather conditions.We now see a montage of the increasing disruption by the weather. This causes delays evacuating civilians, and there is still 60% of the population still in the city when sirens begin to sound indicating the attack has begun.The aliens brush past a combined aircraft and artillery attack and three crafts begin to assemble over Washington. Dr. Marvin fires the sound weapon and downs one of the alien craft. Artillery batteries open fire again to distract the remaining ships as Dr. Marvin repositions his weapon to attempt a further attack.The aliens respond by opening fire on various buildings around the White House and Capitol building. Dr Marvin races with their team to re-deploy and defend the White House. A second ray unit is destroyed and the aliens land. Local soldiers attempt to slow down the invaders as the second machine deployed.The two remaining ships are brought down in quick order. On the other side of Washington more ray units deploy and yet another ship is brought down crashing into the Washington monument. A running battle breaks out around the Supreme Court trapping the Marvins amid the wreckage.An emergency broadcast announces that more saucers are landing in front of the Capitol building. A battle intensifies as more ships appear and the aliens leave their craft in one final assault. This is beaten back with a combination of ray machines and infantry. Suddenly everything goes quiet and slowly the realization comes that the battle is over and the aliens have been repelled.Some time has passed and we now find the Marvins relaxing on a beach. Mrs. Marvin reads a newspaper article that her husband has been placed in charge of rebuilding Project Skyhook and that the United Nations is going to award him a gold medal.The two go for a swim in the ocean as the final credits roll."

Morbius goes on to explain he requires nothing, no rescue is required and he can't guarantee the safety of the ship or its crew.Adams confirms that Morbius was a member of the original crew, but is puzzled at the cryptic warning Morbius realizes the ship is going to land regardless, and gives the pilot coordinates in a desert region of the planet. The ship lands and security details deploy. Within minutes a high speed dust cloud approaches the ship. Adams realizes it is a vehicle, and as it arrives the driver is discovered to be a robot (Robby). Robby welcomes the crew to Altair 4 and invites members of the crew to Morbius' residence.Adams, Farman and Doc Ostrow (Warren Stevens) arrive at the residence and are greeted by Morbius. They sit down to a meal prepared by Robby's food synthesizer and Morbius shows the visitors Robby's other abilities, including his unwavering obedience. Morbius then gives Robby a blaster with orders to shoot Adams. Robby refuses and goes into a mechanical mind lock, disabling him until the order is changed.Morbius then shows the men the defense system of the house (A series of steel shutters). When questioned, Morbius admits that the Belleraphon crew is dead, Morbius and his wife being the only original survivors. Morbius's wife has also died, but months after the others and from natural causes. Morbius goes on to explain many of the crew were torn limb from limb by a strange creature or force living on the planet. The Belleraphon herself was destroyed when the final three surviving members tried to take off for Earth.Adams wonders why this force has remained dormant all these years and never attacked Morbius. As discussions continue, a young woman Altaira (Anne Francis) introduces herself as Morbius daughter. Farman takes an immediate interest in Altaira, and begins to flirt with her.Altaira then shows the men her ability to control wild animals by petting a wild tiger. During this display the ship checks in on the safety of the away party. Adams explains he will need to check in with Earth for further orders and begins preparations for sending a signal. Because of the power needed the ship will be disabled for up to 10 days. Morbius is mortified by this extended period and offers Robby's services in building the communication facility.The next day Robby arrives at ship as the crew unloads the engine to power the transmitter. To lighten the tense moment the commander instructs the crane driver to pick up Cookie (Earl Holliman) and move him out of the way. Quinn interrupts the practical joke to report that the assembly is complete and they can transmit in the morning.Meanwhile Cookie goes looking for Robby and organizes for the robot to synthesize some bourbon. Robby takes a sample and tells Cookie he can have 60 gallons ready the next morning for him.Farman continues to court Altair by teaching her how to kiss, and the health benefits of kissing. Adams interrupts the exercise, and is clearly annoyed with a mix of jealous. He then explains to Altair that the clothes she wears are inappropriate around his crew. Altair tries to argue till Adams looses patience and order Altair to leave the area.That night, Altair, still furious, explains to her father what occurred. Altair takes Adams advice to heart and orders Robby to run up a less revealing dress. Meanwhile back at the ship, two security guards think they hear breathing in the darkness but see nothing.Inside the ship, one of the crew half asleep sees the inner hatch opened and some material moved around. Next morning the Captain holds court on the events of the night before. Quinn advises the captain that most of the missing and damaged equipment can be replaced except for the klystron monitor. Angry, the Capt. and Doc go back to Morbius to confront him about what has occurred.Morbius is unavailable, so the two men settle in to wait. Outside Adams sees Altair swimming and goes to speak to her. Thinking she is naked, Adams becomes flustered and unsettled till he realizes she wants him to see her new dress. Altair asks why Adams wont kiss her like everyone else has. He gives in and plants one on her. Behind them a tiger emerges from the forest and attacks Altair, Adams reacts by shooting it. Altair is badly troubled by the incident; the tiger had been her friend, but she can't understand why it acted as if she was an enemy.Returning to the house, Doc and Adams accidentally open Morbius' office. They find a series of strange drawings but no sign of Morbius. He appears through a secret door and is outraged at the intrusion. Adams explains the damage done to the ship the previous night and his concern that Morbius was behind the attack.Morbius admits it is time for explanations. He goes on to tell them about a race of creatures that lived on the planet called the Krell. In the past they had visited Earth, which explains why there are Earth animals on the planet. Morbius believes the Krell civilization collapsed in a single night, right on the verge of their greatest discovery. Today 2000 centuries later, nothing of their cities exists above ground.Morbius then takes them on a tour of the Krell underground installation. Morbius first shows them a device for projecting their knowledge; he explains how he began to piece together information. Then an education device that projects images formed in the mind. Finally he explains what the Krell were expected to do, and how much lower human intelligence is in comparison.Doc tries the intelligence tester but is confused when it does not register as high as Morbius. Morbius then explains it can also boost intelligence, and that the captain of the Belleraphon died using it. Morbius himself was badly injured but when he recovered his IQ had doubled.Adams questions why all the equipment looks brand new. It is explained that all the machines left on the planet are self repairing and Morbius takes them on a tour of the rest of the installation. First they inspect a giant air vent that leads to the core of the planet. There are 400 other such shafts in the area and 9200 thermal reactors spread through the facilities 8000 cubic miles.Later that night the crew has completed the security arrangements and tests the force field fence. Cookie asks permission to go outside the fence. He meets Robby, who gives him the 60 gallons of bourbon.Outside, something hits the fence and shorts it out. The security team checks the breach but finds nothing. A series of foot-like depressions begin forming leading to the ship. Something unseen enters the ship. A scream echos through the compound.Back at the Morbius residence he argues that only he should be allowed to control the flow of Krell technology back to Earth. In the middle of the discussion, Adams is paged and told that the Chief Quinn has been murdered. Adams breaks off his discussions and heads back to the ship.Later that night, Doc finds the footprints and makes a cast. The foot makes no evolutionary sense. It seems to have elements of a four footed and biped creature; also it seems to be both a predator and herbivore. Adams questions Cookie, who was with the robot during the test, and decides the robot was not responsible.The next day at the funeral for Chief, Morbius again warns him of impending doom facing the ship and crew. Adams considers this a challenge and spends the day fortifying the position around the ship. After testing the weapons and satisfied all that could be done has, the radar station suddenly reports movement in the distance moving slowly towards the ship.No one sees anything despite the weapons being under radar fire control. The controller confirms a direct hit, but the object is still moving towards the ship. Suddenly something hits the force field fence, and a huge monster appears outlined in the energy flux. The crew open fire, but seem to do little good. Two of the crewmen forward but are quickly killed. The pilot Farman runs forward and is also killed.Morbius wakes hearing the screams of Altair. She's had a dream mimicking the attack that has just occurred. As Morbius is waking up, the creature in the force field disappears. Doc theorizes that the creature is made of some sort of energy, renewing itself second by second.Adams takes Doc in the tractor to visit Morbius, intending to evacuate him from the planet. He leaves orders for the ship to be readied for liftoff. If he and Doc don't get back, the ship is to leave without them. They also want to try and break into Morbius' office and take the brain booster test.They are met at the door by Robby, who disarms them. Altair appears and countermands the orders given to Robby by her father. Seeing a chance, Doc sneaks into the office. Altair argues with Adams about trying to make Morbius return home; she ultimately declares her love for him.Robby appears carrying the injured Doc. Struggling to speak and in heavy pain, Doc explains that the Krell succeeded in their great experiment. However they forgot about the subconscious monsters they would release. Monsters from the I.D.Morbius sees the dead body of Doc, and makes a series of ugly comments. His daughter reminds him that Doc is dead. Morbius' lack of care convinces Altair she is better off going with Adams. Morbius tries to talk Adams out of taking Altair.Adams demands an explanation of the I.D. Morbius realizes he is the source of the creature killing everyone. The machine the Krell built was able to release his inner beast, the subconscious monster dwelling deep inside his ancestral mind.Robby interrupts the debate to report something approaching the house. Morbius triggers the defensive shields of the house, which the creature begins to destroy. Morbius then orders Robby to destroy the creature; however, Robby short circuits. Adams explained that it was useless; Robby knew it was Morbius himself.Adams, Altair and Morbius retreat to the Krell lab and seal themselves in by sealing a special indestructible door. Adams convinces Morbius that he is really the monster, and that Morbius cannot actually control his subconscious desires.The group watch as the creature beings the slow process of burning through the door. Panicked, Morbius implores Altair to say it is not so. Suddenly the full realization comes, and he understands that he could endanger or even kill Altair.As the creature breaks through, Morbius rushes forward and denies its existence. Suddenly the creature disappears but Morbius is mortally wounded. With his dying breath he instructs Adams to trigger a self destruct mechanism linked to the reactors of the great machine. The ship and crew have 24 hours to get as far away from the planet as possibleThe next day we see the ship deep in space. Robby (now piloting the ship) and Altair are on board watching as the planet brightens and is destroyed. Adams assures Altair that her father's memory will shine like a beacon."

tt0049259,['Drama'],"This film by the director Ren√© Cl√©ment was adapted from a novel, ""L'Assommoir,"" by the celebrated French writer, Emil Zola. It examines the working class life in 1860s France, including its problem with alcohol abuse that transcends time and culture. Unfortunately, its distribution in the United States seems to have been rather limited, which is most regrettable because of the film's historical and social significance, excellent production, and outstanding cast.Like a Greek tragedy, ""Gervaise"" is a tale of inevitable destruction. The heroine, Gervaise (Maria Schell), is a Parisian working-class woman during the Second Empire (1860s) who attempts to improve her social status. Her efforts are doomed, however, by a couple of selfish alcoholics-- her first lover Lantier (Armand Mestral), and her husband Coupeau (Francois Perier). The fascination of the character of Gervaise is her courage against all odds and the tragedy of her inevitable downfall and destruction, given the social dictates of the era.1852. Gervaise's lover of eight years, the disreputable Lantier, abandons her and their two children. She learns of his departure at the central laundry where she is busy washing clothes. Gervaise is a ""blanchisseuse,"" a laundress. Virginie (Suzy Delair), a friend of Lantier, taunts her, humiliating her in front of the other workers. This in turn, provokes a spectacular brawl, which results in a no less spectacular smacking of Virginie's derri√®re with a washerwoman's battledore.In order to raise the children, Gervaise decides to go it alone, but soon she realizes it is not possible and she marries Coupeau, a roofer by profession, a serious, good-humored fellow. Soon after their marriage, a third child, Nana, is born. Gervaise's dream is to establish herself in her own laundry shop, and she starts saving her wages for that purpose, until Coupeau falls from a roof. Gervaise refuses to send him to the hospital, preferring to tend to him herself at home. In so doing, she spends her savings to the last penny to nurse him back to health. For Coupeau, now somewhat crippled and embittered, this is the beginning of the end, a slow but inexorable descent into alcoholism.After some reservations, Gervaise accepts a loan from Goujet (Jacques Harden), a blacksmith and her husband's friend, and acquires her own laundry shop. Everything is going well, until Virginie, now married to Mr. Poisson (Lucien Hubert), a gendarmerie sergeant, settles again in the neighborhood. She schemes revenge for her earlier humiliation against Gervaise, using Lantier, who has also reappeared on the scene.Gervaise, surrounded by all of her friends, is having her birthday dinner in her shop. Lantier is loitering about just outside the shop, waiting for an opportunity to crash the party. This chance arrives when Coupeau, drunk as usual, invites Lantier to come in and join the dinner, and extends to him hospitality for the night in his small lodging at the rear of the shop. Soon, to Gervaise's despair, Lantier becomes a permanent fixture. Gervaise cannot turn for help to Goujet, who has since been thrown in jail for leading a workers' strike. The inevitable happens: Lantier, taking advantage of one of Coupeau's drunken episodes, drags Gervaise into his room and forces himself on her. Goujet, now out of jail returns to meet Gervaise, but suspecting that she is involved in some kind of ""m√©nage a trois,"" is so disappointed, he leaves for the north region of France, taking along Gervaise's oldest son, Etienne, to be an apprentice.From there on, Gervaise has nowhere to turn for help, and loses all hope. She has become the slave of two drunks who steal her money and live at her expense. Her shop is going down the drain, and her employees abandon her, one after another. Coupeau's health worsens. Lantier thinks this is the opportune moment to suggest she sell her laundry. It just so happens he has a prospective buyer, in the person of Virginie. At last, Gervaise realizes the deviousness of Virginie and of her accomplice, and chases them out.Coupeau, during a violent episode of ""delirium tremens,"" wrecks the shop, after which he is taken to the hospital, where he dies. Virginie then takes possession of the ruined laundry and reopens it as a confectionery, while Lantier re-settles in the back of the shop, as the gigolo he has always been.Gervaise, totally bewildered and alone, sinks deeper and deeper into depression and alcoholism. Her young daughter, Nana, left to her own devices, is on her way to becoming a streetwalker and later on a high class ""cocotte."""
tt0049261,"['Drama', 'Western']","In the 1920s, Jordan ""Bick"" Benedict, Jr. (Rock Hudson), head of a wealthy Texas ranching family, travels to Maryland to buy War Winds, a horse he is planning to put out to stud. There he meets and courts socialite Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), who ends a budding relationship with English gentleman Sir David Karfrey (Rod Taylor) and marries Bick after a whirlwind romance.They return to Texas to start their life together on the family ranch, Reata, which is owned and run by Luz (Mercedes McCambridge), Bick's older and grumpy sister. Leslie doesn't get along with Luz for Luz scorns Leslie's wealthy background while Leslie thinks that Luz is rude. Jett Rink (James Dean) is a local ranch hand who works for Luz and hopes to find his fortune by leaving Texas; he also has a secret love for Leslie despite the fact that she is married to his boss.One day during a cattle roundup, Luz expresses her hostility for Leslie by cruelly digging in her spurs while riding Leslie's beloved horse, War Winds. Luz dies after War Winds bucks her off, and as part of her will, Jett is given a small plot of land within the 595,000-acre Benedict ranch. Bick tries to buy back the land, but Jett refuses. Jett keeps the fenced off waterhole as his home and names the property Little Reata.A few years later, Leslie eventually gives birth to twins, Jordan ""Jordy"" Benedict III (Dennis Hopper as a teenager and young adult) and Judy Benedict (Fran Bennett as a teen and young adult), and a younger daughter named Luz II (Carroll Baker as a teen and young adult).One day, Jett discovers oil in a footprint left by Leslie and develops an oil drilling well on his property. Bick is annoyed with Jett's prospecting and tries to deny him access to his land. Finally Jett hits his first gusher, he drives into the Benedict yard (covered in crude oil) proclaiming in front of the entire family that he will be richer than the Benedicts. After Jett makes a rude sexual remark to Leslie, Bick and Jett have a fist fight.Shortly after, in the 1930s, Jett starts an oil drilling company, named 'JetTexas' that makes him enormously wealthy. But Bick resists the lure of drilling for oil on his much larger part of the cattle ranch, preferring to remain a rancher to maintain the legacy of his family's original business.During the 1940s, tensions in the Benedict household revolve around how the parents want to bring up their grown-up children. Bick stubbornly insists that Jordy must succeed him and run the ranch, just like his father and grandfather before him, but Jordy wants to be a doctor. Leslie wants Judy to attend finishing school in Switzerland, but Judy loves the ranch and wants to stay in Texas for her education (and to her high school boyfriend).After World War II breaks out, Jett visits the Benedicts and tries to convince Bick to allow oil production on his land to help the war effort. Bick finally realizes there is no one to take over the ranch after him, and concedes. During this visit, Luz II, now a teen-aged girl, starts flirting with Jett. Once oil production starts, the wealthy Benedict family becomes even wealthier, depicted by the addition of a swimming pool next to the house. Jordy gets married to a young Mexican-American woman and they have a son. Judy gets married to her long-term high school boyfriend and they too have a son.The Benedict/Rink rivalry continues however, and it comes to a head when the Benedicts find out that Luz II and the much older Jett Rink have been dating. At a huge gala Jett organizes in his own honor, an irate Jordy tries to fight him, after realizing he and his Mexican American wife, Juana (Elsa C√°rdenas), were invited just so Jett's employees could turn Juana away. Jett has his goons hold Jordy and punches him out in front of the crowd. Fed up, Bick then takes Jett to a kitchen room, about to fight him, but realizes that Jett is now just a drunken shell of a man, who has only his money. He tells him, ""You're not even worth hitting. ... You're all through,"" and leaves, but not before symbolically and quite noisily caving in Rink's wine cellar shelves domino style. The party ends when Jett, completely drunk, slumps down in front of everyone before his big speech. Luz II sees him afterwards, once everyone has left the ballroom, and discovers that he is a lonely, pathetic wreck who can only repeat how much he still loves Leslie.The Benedicts, all except Jordy, drive down an empty road to a diner. An altercation develops between the racist diner owner Sarge (Mickey Simpson) and Bick after he refuses to serve a non-English-speaking Mexican family that just walked in who have no dollars but pesos. Bick intervenes on behalf of the Mexican family. A fist fight ensues when Bick stands up for the immigrant family against the racist Sarge, leaving Bick the loser who collapses over a table of pies. Sarge throws all of them out of the diner saying that it is his American free right to refuse service to people he does not like, including paying customers.Later, in the final scene back at the ranch, Bick and Leslie watch their two grandchildren, one biracial (Jordy and Juana's son), play in a crib and reflect on their life. Leslie tells Bick that she considered him to be her hero for the first time in her life after the fight in the diner, something he always tried to do with his ranching heroics. Reflecting on the Benedict family's legacy, Bick views it as a failure because their lives didn't turn out the way he planned, but Leslie considers their version of the family to be a success. The final shot pans to the face of each child, one white, one Hispanic, but both Texans."

tt0049366,"['Drama', 'Horror', 'SciFi']","An apparently delusional and paranoid Dr. Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) has been arrested on a California highway and taken to a local hospital's psychiatric ward. There he tells a psychiatrist, Dr. Hill (Whit Bissell), and the attending physician, Dr. Bassett (Richard Deacon) his fantastic story.Several days earlier, Miles had been called home to Santa Mira from a medical convention. His nurse, Sally Withers (Jean Willes) told him that several patients had come in frantically insisting that their relatives and friends were not who they seemed to be. On the way to the office, Miles and Sally nearly ran over young Jimmy Grimaldi (Bobby Clark) who was fleeing from his mother (Eileen Stevens). Mrs. Grimaldi says Jimmy simply didn't want to go to school. Miles was sad to see that the Grimaldis had shut down their vegetable stand because it was too much work.Later, at his office, Miles learned that many of the patients begging for his return claimed they no longer needed his services. A former girlfriend, Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter) stopped by. She told him that her cousin, Wilma (Virginia Christine), insisted that her father, Ira (Tom Fadden), wasn't who he seemed to be. Miles agreed to visit Wilma later. Miles and Becky chatted, revealing that they both had recently divorced. After lunch, Jimmy Grimaldi was brought to Miles's office by his grandmother. He insisted that his mother was not really his mother. Suspicious, Miles gave the boy a sedative and told his grandmother to keep the boy at her house that night.Miles and Becky visited Ira and Wilma. Miles admitted his examination of Ira led him to conclude that it was indeed Ira. Wilma insisted that although nothing physically or mentally seemed different about him, his emotional connection to her was wrong. Wilma agreed to see a psychiatrist to discuss her concerns. That night, Becky and Miles went to dinner and encountered the town psychiatrist, Dan Kauffman (Larry Gates), in the parking lot. He mentioned that he too had seen many perplexing cases of people claiming that loved ones had somehow changed.Before they could eat, Miles and Becky were called to the house of Jack and Teddy Belicec (King Donovan and Carolyn Jones). They had found an inert, featureless humanoid creature in their poolroom. Teddy was disturbed by it, and the creature seemed to be taking on Jack's features. It even bled from a hand as Jack did when he cut it on a piece of glass. Miles took Becky home to her father's house. Her father (Kenneth Patterson) seemed normal but Miles was disturbed by something. Returning to the Driscoll house later that night, he broke into the basement and found another humanoid transforming itself into Becky. He snuck upstairs and rescued Becky.Miles and Jack called Dan Kauffman to see the bodies at the Belicecs' and Driscolls'. Both were missing. Dan suggested that they found a real dead human in Jack's poolroom and that its cause of death had been too small for Miles to notice in his examination. He also suggested that Miles saw Becky's double because he had been so unsettled by the mysterious body at the Belicecs'. Becky's father had called the police when he heard Dan, Jack and Miles in his basement. When Police Chief Grivett (Ralph Dumke) arrived, he informed them that a burning body matching the description of what the Belicecs found had been discovered burning outside of town.In town the next day, Miles encountered Wilma who told him she felt better about Ira and didn't need to see Dan. Based on Miles's demeanor she realized he knew something, and told Becky's father, who was hiding in her antique store. At his office, Miles saw Jimmy smiling next to his mother in the waiting room, apparently unconcerned about her anymore. That night, Miles, Becky and the Belicecs planned to barbeque. But Miles found enormous seed pods in his greenhouse. The pods opened up and inert bodies fell out. They quickly began to take the form of Miles and his guests. Miles tried to call the FBI in Los Angeles, Sacramento and Washington D.C. but was told by the operator that the lines are dead. Miles destroyed the creatures, then he and Becky and the Belicecs split up, hoping to get out of town. Miles and Becky stopped for gas. When Miles went to a phone booth to try to reach the FBI again, the gas station attendant placed two pods in the trunk of his car. Miles realized this and destroyed the pods later. He drove to Sally's house. Sneaking up to a window, he saw that she too had been transformed into a pod person and coolly planned to place a seed pod in the crib of her newborn. Miles was discovered by another police officer. Miles and Becky escaped, pursued by the police and other pod people.Miles and Becky hid out in Miles's office. Realizing that the pods were most effective at replacing people when they were asleep, they took amphetamines to stay awake. The next morning, they saw police officers detain people just arriving to town, and watched as transformed citizens accepted pods to take to their relatives in nearby cities. Jack, Dan and Chief Grivett arrived. Miles and Becky were horrified to learn they'd all been transformed. Jack and Dan explained that the pods had arrived from outer space and that the transformation was painless. Soon everyone would be reborn into a better way of life, evolved beyond human emotions like hate and love. Jack and Dan brought pods into Miles's waiting room and locked Miles and Becky in the office. Miles filled three syringes with a sedative, then created a diversion that brought Dan and Jack back into the office. Miles struggled with them but drugged them, with Becky taking care of Grivett.Hoping to pretend to have been transformed by appearing emotionless, Becky and Miles made their way out of the office and into the street. But Becky saw a truck nearly hit a dog and called out in fear. Alerted, the pod people chased Becky and Miles into the hills around Santa Mira. They hid in an abandoned mine. Miles left Becky to try to find help. When he returned, he found Becky asleep. He tried to carry her to safety but learned when he kissed her that she had been transformed too. With other pod people in pursuit, Miles ran to the highway. He pleaded with motorists to stop but they considered him crazy. He saw a truck full of pods headed to Los Angeles. Miles wandered the highway, telling people that ""They're already here! You're next!""Drs. Hill and Basset consider Miles insane and plan his treatment. Then an ambulance brings in a truck driver who had been in an accident. His truck was full of unusual pods, and had been on the road from Santa Mira. Realizing Miles is telling the truth, Dr. Hill immediately calls the police and the FBI."

Despite her threat to leave, Anna reluctantly disembarks with Louis and the Kralahome.Once inside the Royal Palace, Anna demands to see King Mongkut and is allowed by the Kralahome to enter the Throne Room. A pleased Mongkut ignores her objections as he introduces her to his numerous wives - who include head wife Lady Thiang and a graceful girl from Burma named Tuptim. King Mongkut then presents the fifteen children she will tutor, aside from the other sixty-seven - among them his eldest son and heir Prince Chulalongkorn. Anna agrees to stay and tutor the King's children, prompting formality to break down. Later that night, Lady Thiang and the other wives assist Anna in unpacking, and when an old photograph of her late husband Tom is discovered, the wives start to deride the unhappy Tuptim because she is in love with another man named Lun Tha, the same man who brought her to Siam.Anna refuses to give up on the house and teaches the children about the virtues of home life, to the irritation of King Mongkut, who contemplates how he craves truth and wonders why the world has become so complicated, with different cultures saying different things. Meanwhile, Anna starts to form a relationship with the children as getting to know people is her favorite thing to teach. The lesson, however, creates disorder when the children refuse to believe in the existence of snow, which they have never seen. The King enters a chaotic schoolroom and, upon noticing Tuptim has a copy of the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, engages in a slightly heated conversation with Anna about slavery - an institution embraced by all his people.That night, Anna is summoned to the King's private chambers where he says that after reading the Bible, he believes that the world was not created in six days, but after many centuries. The King disregards her explanation and orders her to take a letter to President Abraham Lincoln, in which he will send male elephants to America to help with the Civil War, forcing her to sit on the floor due to an ancient custom that nobody's head should be higher than his. She is left to finish the letter herself when she tries to explain that the elephants will not last long if only male elephants are sent. Anna goes outside, only to come across Lun Tha and learn that he has been meeting Tuptim in secret. He asks her to arrange a rendezvous and she refuses out of fear, but eventually relents after remembering her past with her husband. The lovers meet under the cover of darkness and Lun Tha promises he will one day return to Siam and they will escape together.The next day, King Mongkut becomes troubled by reports of spreading British imperialism. He bursts into the schoolroom after hearing Anna's pupils persist in singing ""Home Sweet Home"". Anna stands her ground, threatening to leave Siam, despite pleas from the children. King Mongkut asserts that Anna is his servant, only to see her repudiate the term and leave the room. Lady Thiang visits Anna later that night and explains that Mongkut is apprehensive over rumors that the British regard him as a barbaric leader, intending to turn Siam into a protectorate. Anna is shocked by the accusations, but is reluctant to give him advice after their argument. Lady Thiang convinces her that the King deserves support, and convinces Anna to go to the King. Anna learns the King is also anxious for reconciliation, and learns that the British are sending an envoy to evaluate the situation in Bangkok. Upon learning that the envoy consists of Ambassador Sir John Hay and her old lover Sir Edward Ramsay, Anna persuades the King to receive them in European style by hosting a banquet with European food and music - after which it is announced that the envoy is arriving in one week. The King promises to give Anna a house of her own in return for her help.On the night of the banquet, Sir Edward reminisces with Anna about old times in an attempt to bring her back to British society. The King however walks in on them dancing and irritably reminds them that dancing is for after dinner. After impressing the guests with his intellectual observations, the King presents Tuptim's version of Uncle Tom's Cabin - which is presented as a traditional Siamese ballet. However, the King and the Kralahome are not impressed, as the play involves the issue of slavery and shows the slaveholding King dead after drowning in the river. By the time Sir John calls for the play's author, Tuptim has left the room to run away with Lun Tha.After the guests have departed, Anna talks with the King and is presented with one of his rings in appreciation of her efforts. He then explains he is not pleased with Tuptim, and reveals she is missing. Anna parries his inquiry by explaining she is unhappy because she is just another woman in his eyes. The King retorts that men are entitled to a plenitude of wives although women must remain faithful. Anna explains the reality of one man loving only one woman and recalls her first dance before teaching the King how to dance the polka, but the touching moment is shattered when the Kralahome bursts into the room with news that Tuptim has been captured. For her dishonor, the King prepares to whip her despite Anna's pleas. She implies that he is a barbarian with no heart and that she will stay to watch the King's actions. The King then crumples, puts his hand over his heart and runs out of the room. The Kralahome blames Anna for ruining him: now he can never be the king he was before. Tuptim meanwhile is led away in tears when she learns that Lun Tha is dead, his body discovered in the river. This causes Anna to return the ring, sever all ties as a governess and leave on the next boat from Siam.On the night of her departure, Anna is prepared to leave Siam with Louis when Lady Thiang says that the King is dying. He refuses to eat or sleep, isolating himself from everyone since the night of the banquet. Lady Thiang gives Anna an unfinished letter from the King that states his deep gratitude and respect for her, despite his harsh differences with her. This prompts her to go to his bedside in tears moments before their ship departs for Britain. The King gives Anna his ring, insisting that she wear it as she has always spoken the truth to him, persuading her and Louis to stay in Bangkok. King Mongkut then passes his title to Prince Chulalongkorn, who then issues a proclamation that brings an end to slavery and states that all subjects will no longer bow down to him. Satisfied that he is leaving his kingdom in capable hands, the King quietly dies. With the attention of all present fixed on Chulalongkorn, only Anna and the Kralahome immediately realise and mourn King Mongkut's passing."

On her way to work, the young woman Eva M√∏ller (Helle Virkner) stops by a clothes store to speak to B√∏rge (Holger Juul Hansen), who has broken their engagement in a brief letter. She finds him with another girl and agitatedly tells him off. Eva works as a seamstress and chats with a co-worker (Caja Heimann) about having too little money and her desire to find a rich man to ease her worries. Their supervisor shouts at Eva for being late and talking too much. After work, Eva is left alone as her co-worker is picked up by her boyfriend. As she walks through the streets she comes across a store with a beautiful gown in the window. As she stands there looking at it, she appears to have an idea and rushes to the house where she lives with her older brother (Ove Sprog√∏e) and his wife (Lis L√∏wert). She changes her clothes and picks up her bankbook and is out the door again. She goes back to the store intending to buy the dress, but the saleswoman tells her it's already been sold, and Eva realizes that it would have been too expensive for her anyway. When the saleswoman (Inger Lassen) goes into another room, Eva sees the dress in a corner and goes to look at it, and when the saleswoman locks up and leaves the store moments later, she doesn't realize that Eva is still inside. Eva puts the dress on and dances around the room imagining it's her own. Suddenly a man appears. He turns out to be the dress designer, Marcel (Angelo Bruun), and instead of being upset he is stunned by her graceful appearance. He has her stay at the store all night to wear his fabrics as he draws new designs. In the morning, shocked by the dull appearance of her usual clothing, he allows her to have the dress from the window as a gift.Eva has to go straight to work and changes into her work clothes in the lavatory. Not having slept all night, however, she falls asleep, dreaming of colourful scenes of love and adoration (including a singing Poul Reichhardt). She is fired, but only has smiles to offer in return. Eva goes home in her dress and faces her brother's questions, but she has her own ideas about what to do. One night she goes out to a bar wearing the dress. Men pay attention to her like never before, but the other women are less pleased. When she runs out she breaks a heel and stumbles, but a young and well-dressed man, Jakob (Henning Moritzen), helps her and offers to drive her home. To appear wealthier than she is she gives him an address in a fancy neighbourhood and ends up hitchhiking home, but at least she has a new date with the dashing man. Meanwhile, Jakob returns his expensive car to the garage, and we learn that he is a student who works odd jobs and not the rich gentleman Eva thinks he is.The next day, Jakob wakes up in a good mood at the pension he lives in, and he loans money from his landlady (Gerda Madsen). At the dress store, there is a commotion as the sold dress has disappeared, until Marcel arrives to tell them that he has simply given it away. Meanwhile, at the house of the fake address that Eva gave Jakob, the young lady who actually lives there, a popular actress named Elizabeth (Nina Pens Rode), is chatting and rehearsing lines with her older husband (Gunnar Lauring). She soon hurries to a dress fitting at Marcel's, where the rich ladies of town are gossipping and inspecting his latest creations. It turns out that it was Elizabeth who had bought the dress Marcel gave to Eva, but Marcel persuades her that it wasn't right for her.At night, Eva and Jakob meet for dinner. She is frightened when it turns out they are going to the restaurant where her brother works as a waiter, but it is her brother who is most ill at ease. Then they go to the theatre to see The Taming of the Shrew, and just as the dialogue mentions a fancy dress, the actress on stage - Elizabeth - notices Eva in her dress in the first row and freezes. After the show in the dressing room, Marcel somes to see Elizabeth, and they argue about the dress. When Marcel implies that she is being ungrateful and that he is solely responsible for her celebrity status, she challenges him to bring Eva to her party the next night and prove his abilities in elevating a young lady to grace and nobility. Meanwhile, Eva and Jakob dance in a night club, and they confess their love to each other.The next day, Eva tells her sister-in-law that she thinks she might marry Jakob. At Elizabeth's house, a love letter arrives from Jakob, who still thinks Eva lives there. When Elizabeth's husband opens it, he assumes it is for Elizabeth. A little later, Jakob arrives at the house, intending to tell Eva the truth about about his financial status, but instead he learns the truth about Eva. Eva, in turn, is left waiting for Jakob in town when Marcel's saleswoman, Jokum, arrives to whisk her off to a dress fitting and then Elizabeth's party. When Jakob also comes to the party on Elizabeth's invitation, the guests are given the impression that the two have a relationship. Elizabeth's husband is disheartened, as is Eva. She confronts Jakob, who in a heated scene finally tells her the truth. She is destraught and leaves the party disillusioned. Meanwhile, the morning papers arrive, and a critic (Olaf Ussing) leaves the party before the present actors and theatre staff can read his scathing review of their play.The morning after, Eva's sister-in-law cheers Eva up, but when her brother, Max, sees them wearing the fancy dresses, he takes the dresses to the store to return them and tell Marcel off for introducing such luxury into his working-class home. But Marcel doesn't pay much attention, and when he later pays a visit to Eva to offer her work he ends up designing a dress for Max's wife, who eventually forces Max to take a different stance. Eva meets Jakob in the street, but they end up arguing again, and she proceeds to Marcel's fashion show, where she appears as a mannequin. But Jakob turns up at the show, and when he sees Eva dressed in a lavish wedding gown, he resolutely walks on stage, tells Eva he wants to marry her and carries her off stage and out the room.

tt0049429,['Horror'],"Someone is killing women in Paris. Four have died in the past six
months, all of them young, with the same blood type, and drained of their
blood. The newspapers have dubbed the killer a ""vampire."" When it seems
that dancer Nora [Ronny Holiday] has become victim number 5, journalist Pierre Lantin [Dario MIchaelis] is on the story, much to the annoyance of police Inspector Chantal [Carlo D'Angelo], who
thinks of Pierre as a meddler looking for publicity.Pierre learns that one of the murdered girls used to attend Ecole
Jean d'Arc, so he heads over to the school to interview her classmates.
All they remember (that they haven't already told the police) is that they
were followed by a dazed-looking man in a trenchcoat just days before the
murder. Pierre finds this interesting because the one picture he has of
Nora also shows a strange man in a trenchcoat walking behind her. The next
day, as Pierre drops off Lorette Roberts [Wandisa Guida], one of the students at the school, he notices the man in the trenchcoat. Pierre follows him to his apartment but, when Pierre returns with
Inspector Chantal, he goes to the wrong apartment (they all look the
same), and the Inspector is duly unimpressed.Knowing that he's being tailed, Joseph Signoret [Paul Muller] (the man in the
trenchcoat) goes straight to the Clinica Salus to see Professor Julien du
Grand [Antoine Balp√™tr√®], for whom Joseph works in return for drugs. It's been Joseph's job
to kidnap young girls for du Grand's experiments, but now he wants out. Du
Grand's assistant gives him an out by strangling him. Du Grand, knowing
that Joseph might have attracted the police, fakes his own death and goes
into hiding on the advice of his cousin and benefactor, the duchess
Margherita du Grand . Reduced to working in secret now, du Grand hitches up
Joseph's body to a machine that circulates his blood and keeps his organs
working, while the duchess Margherita demands that du Grand complete his
experiments because she is giving a ball tomorrow evening and wants her
niece Giselle [Gianna Maria Canale] to attend. Giselle, considered the most beautiful woman in
Paris, has the hots for Pierre, but Pierre prefers to keep a wide berth
around Giselle and her aunt Margherita, because Margherita destroyed
Pierre's parents with her selfish love for Pierre's father. Still, Pierre
is ordered by his editor to cover the ball for the society page, and
Pierre reluctantly agrees.Meanwhile, Lorette is stopped on the way home from school by a blind
man asking her to deliver a letter to an address next to the Church of the
Sacred Heart. When Lorette goes there, however, she is chloroformed and
taken to the du Grand castle, where she is slated to become du Grand's
next victim. When Lorette doesn't show up for dinner that evening, Pierre
and her parents go to the police. The police find the blind man and get the address of the
apartment, but the apartment has been abandoned.The next evening, Pierre attends the du Grand ball. He fends off
Giselle's attempts to interest him and leaves, but Pierre's partner Ronald
Fontaine [Angelo Galassi], who is lusting after Giselle, remains after hours and scales the
castle wall to get into her bedroom. When Giselle irately refuses his
advances, her resulting anger shows in her face as she rapidly ages,
turning into old Margherite. Now that Ronald knows Giselle/Margherite's
secret, he cannot be allowed to live, so Margherite shoots Ronald and
steps up her demand that Prof du Grand complete his treatment on her, even
if it is not yet perfected. Reluctantly, du Grand prepares Lorette for the
treatment, which involves hooking her and Margherite to the blood machine.
After three hours on the machine, Margherite turns back into the beautiful
Giselle and Lorette falls into a deathlike sleep.The next day, Pierre runs into Giselle on her way into an art store.
He watches as she writes a check using her left hand. This catches
Pierre's attention because Lorette is also left-handed. When Pierre finds
out that Ronald never returned from the ball last night, he puts 2 and 2
together and attempts to get Inspector Chantal to investigate. Chantal
refuses to search the castle until Pierre provides with proof, so Pierre
goes to the castle alone. There, he runs into Joseph, who has mysteriously
awakened from his death and is lumbering around the castle grounds trying
to get away. Pierre takes Joseph to the police, Joseph confesses his part
in the murders, drops dead...again, and Inspector Chantal finally agrees
to pay a visit to the castle.The police search the castle but find nothing. Just as they are about
to leave, Giselle reverts into Margherite before their eyes. This time a
fevered search finds a passage they missed before. It leads to a hidden
room where they are surprised to discover Professor du Grand alive and
well just before they shoot him. Looking in du Grand's coffin, the police
find Lorette, weak and in need of medical attention, but well enough to
reveal her attraction to Pierre. While the ambulance takes Lorette to the
hospital, Pierre and Chantal go out for coffee together. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

An international incident is avoided when Louis Bernard (Daniel Gelin), a Frenchman, intercedes on the McKennas' behalf. While Ben is happy to tell Louis all about his family and their planned excursions in Marrakech, his wife Jo is suspicious of the Frenchman's constant questioning.That night, Louis meets the McKennas in their hotel room for dinner, but suddenly cancels their supper plans when Rien (Reggie Nalder), a hired assassin, appears at the McKennas' door. Later, at an Arab restaurant, Ben and Jo meet a British couple, the Draytons (Bernard Miles and Brenda de Banzie), who claim to be fans of Jo, who was a well-known singer prior to her marriage to Ben.The next morning, the McKennas and Draytons meet at the local marketplace. The usual frivolity of the market crowd is broken when a man being chased by the police collapses in Ben's arms, having been fatally stabbed in the back. It is Louis, disguised as an Arab, who, with his dying breaths, tells the physician that there is a plot to assassinate an unnamed statesman in London. With his final breath, Louis tells Ben to get to London to contact the authorities to tell them to ""try Ambrose Chapel"".While the McKennas are taken to the police station for questioning, Mrs. Drayton agrees to care for Hank in their absence. A police detective reveals that Louis Bernard was a spy working for the French government. Just then, Ben receives a telephone call from a mysterious man who informs him that Hank has been kidnapped and threatens to harm him unless the McKennas say nothing to the police about Bernard's last words. After arriving back at the hotel, Ben learns that Mrs. Drayton never arrived back with Hank, and that her husband, Mr. Drayton checked out a half-hour ago.After giving the high-strung Jo a sedative, Ben informs his wife that their only son has been abducted. Aware that the Draytons left Marrakech on a private plane, Ben and Jo decide to go to London and search for Hank there. Greeted at the airport by both Jo's fans and the police, the McKennas are interviewed by Inspector Buchanan (Ralph Truman) of Scotland Yard, who tells them that he is well aware of the reason why their son was kidnapped. Despite his wife's pleas, Ben refuses to tell the inspector what Louis said to him, claiming that the British secret agent had spoken to him in French. Jo then receives a phone call from Mrs. Drayton, who allows the McKennas to briefly speak to Hank.Checking into a London hotel, the McKennas attempt to call Ambrose Chapel, the name Louis told Ben, but they are interrupted by the arrival of Jo's old acquaintances: Val and Helen Parnell (Alan Mowbray and Alix Talton), Jan Peterson (Hillary Brooke) and Cindy Fontaine (Carolyn Jones). While Jo stays behind with her friends, Ben sneaks out through the hotel's service entrance to meet Chapel. At the Ambrose taxidermy shop, Ben is slow to realize that neither Ambrose Sr. nor Ambrose Jr. is involved in his son's kidnapping, and is forced to make a quick escape before the police arrive.Meanwhile, at the hotel, Jo realizes that ""Ambrose Chapel"" is a place, not a person, and she is soon met there by Ben. Inside the church, Hank is being held captive by the Draytons, whom are the leaders of an international anarchist group. An assistant named Edna is assigned to watch over Hank. Also there is Rien, who is being instructed by the Draytons as to the exact moment during an Albert Hall concert that he is to commit the assassination: at a climactic cymbal crash in the performance of a cantata.The McKennas enter the chapel just as the service, administered by Mr. Drayton, is about to begin. While Ben stays inside, Jo leaves to call the police, so the Draytons cut short the service. Hearing his son's voice, Ben rushes to Hank's aid, only to be knocked unconscious by one of Draytons' henchmen. By the time the police arrive at the chapel, the Draytons have made their escape with Hank. Refusing to enter the locked church without a search warrant, the police leave, so Jo calls the police station, begging for help. She asks to speak to Buchanan, but is told that he is at an important diplomatic function at a concert at Albert Hall. When the policeman refuses to contact Buchanan, she heads off alone to Albert Hall to find him. When Rien sees her there, the assassin reminds Jo that Hank's safety depends on her silence.Meanwhile, Ben escapes the locked chapel by climbing the church bell's rope and also makes his way to the concert. Realizing that Rien is about to shoot a visiting foreign prime minister, Jo screams, causing the startled assassin to merely wound the dignitary in the arm. Ben then jumps Rien, and in his attempt to escape, the assassin falls from the balcony to his death.At the embassy, the Draytons hide out there where are informed by the ambassador (Mogens Wieth) (who hired them for the assassination job) that their assassination attempt on the prime minister has failed.

Jo is asked to perform for the guests, and her singing voice is soon recognized by Hank. Under Mrs. Drayton's instruction, the young boy whistles along with her singing, guiding Ben to the room in which his son is being held. Mr. Drayton then appears, but rather than killing them, he decides to use Ben and Hank as human shields during his escape from the embassy.

tt0049509,"['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Romance']","This sentimental film about World War II was made ten years after the war ended. It opens in 1942, when timid Ruth Wood (Jane Wyman) is accosted by boisterous GI Art Hugenon (Van Johnson) on the street. Despite her protestations, he cheekily invites himself to dinner with her and her mother. Ruth's mother is in a state of permanent depression. Years ago, her husband left her for another woman and abandoned her and Ruth. She's held a grudge against men ever since, even though she's carefully preserved all her husband's possessions and continues to carefully mend the clothing he left behind. She definitely has issues. Needless to say, she cowers at the sight of Art. Art makes her even more miserable when he finds some music her musician husband wrote before he left. Art sits down at the piano and plays it and starts to make up words to go with the music. Ruth's mother is terrified that Ruth will abandon her the same way her husband did. We can see the kind of pressure Ruth is under to please her mother and how desolate her life was before she met Art.Art and Ruth have a whirlwind courtship that consists of enjoying the city. They go to an auction and Ruth buys Art a supposedly old Roman coin for two dollars. Art says he'll punch a hole in it and wear it around his neck to remind him of her. Art loves New York, and after the war he wants to move to the city and be a reporter for the New York Times. He even manages to sell the paper a story about a down and out, once famous and wealthy, boat designer he and Ruth meet in Central Park. They also have dinner at a French restaurant where Ruth's dad (unbeknownst to her) plays the piano for the diners. Her father recognizes her, laments his failures as a husband and father to the bartender, and his ultimate response is to knock down some drinks at the bar and then creep out the door.As to be expected, Art's unit is called overseas. He and Ruth have an emotional farewell. Art asks Ruth to marry him and gives her his mother's engagement ring. Considering how emotionally neglected Ruth has been her whole life, this is earthshaking. She gets a scrapbook with his name embossed on it and carefully cuts out his article from the Times and pastes it in. She writes him every day, but he never writes back. Then, she gets a letter from one of his Army buddies. Art has died in combat and his last words were of his love for Ruth. Ruth is heartbroken naturally, and she goes off the deep end into strange behavior and a crippling depression.Her friend Agnes takes her St. Patrick's Cathedral to see if sitting quietly in the church will help her come out of her grief. Instead it makes Ruth's behavior even stranger. Ruth (who's not Catholic) becomes obsessed with lighting candles and putting them directly in front of a statue of St. Andrew so that he won't be ""alone in the dark."" A young priest tries to help her, but to no avail. Ruth's also coughing all the time, she's starting to get sick. Her sleazy, womanizing boss takes her out to the same French restaurant she went to with Art and tries to hit on her. Her dad is there to play the piano, but he turns on the radio and hears the music he wrote at home (and now including Art's words) being played. Art had had a musician friend Dixie Dooley and he innocently gave Dixie the music to evaluate before he went overseas. Ruth's dad figures his wife must have sold the composition and, despite all the years he's spent away from her, casually decides to call her on the phone. He doesn't see Ruth. She leaves her creepy boss and walks out of the restaurant while he's in the phone booth. A coward again, he hangs up when his wife answers the phone.Now Ruth is really sick. She has pneumonia. Her mom actually comes to life and starts to take care of her daughter instead of her usual moping around their shabby apartment. Ruth's mother falls asleep on the divan in the living room and Ruth climbs out of her sickbed and walks out into into the rainy New York night. Her father, who has been lurking around the building trying to work up the courage to see his wife, doesn't see her. He finally makes it upstairs to the apartment and apologizes to Ruth's mother for what a heel he's been. Ruth's mother comes to her senses (somewhat) and then realizes Ruth is gone. She shrieks to her husband that he must find Ruth. He leaves to find her.Ruth wanders in the rain to St. Patrick's. In her delirium, she sees Art. He bounds across Fifth Avenue and gives her a hug and tells her he loves her. It's a genuinely affecting scene. He presses the chain with the Roman coin on it into her hand, reaffirms his love, explains that he had not been able to write to her, and says he has to go. She collapses on the steps of the church, alone in the rain. The priest and an altar boy find her. Agnes shows up too. They notice something in her hand. It's the chain with the coin on it. Agnes exclaims that Art took wore it when he went overseas and she can't understand how Ruth has it now. That's the miracle in the rain the film's title refers to.The movie basically ends with Ruth on the floor in the vestibule of the church attended by the priest and Agnes, waiting for the ambulance to arrive. The curious viewer is left with the open question as to whether or not Ruth actually survived her pneumonia considering that the story was set in 1942."

When he walks nearer to the camera and we see his face in closeup, we hear the words ""Call me Ishmael,"" He is the narrator (Richard Basehart), a young man who has experience in the merchant marine but has recently decided to see a different world by signing on to a whaling ship. By nightfall he arrives at the Spouter Inn in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and agrees to share a bed with a then absent stranger. He enjoys drinks at the inn and as he waits for night he is told of the rules for seeking work on whaling ships by Stubb (Harry Andrews). He is questioned, and after his answers are deemed satisfactory he is accepted by a group of seamen and he joins in drinking songs with them. During the storm, they spot the mysterious Captain Ahab (Gregory Peck) walking in the rainWhen his room and bed mate, a heavily tattooed Polynesian harpooner named Queequeg (Friedrich von Ledebur), returns very late and discovers Ishmael in the bed under the blankets, both men are alarmed, but the two quickly become close friends and decide to sail together on a whaling ship.The duo signs on with the Pequod, a whaling ship that is soon to leave port. Two owner partners make the hiring decisions and negotiate the compensation, which is a fraction of the profit from the voyage. They are suspicious of Queequeg but he shows his marksmanship with the harpoon and they gladly accept him at 1/300 fraction, where Ishmael only gets 1/600. The ships captain, Ahab, is nowhere to be seen; nevertheless, the owners speak of his solid reputation and legendary experience.On a church near the ships, townspeople and seamen gather for a Sunday service. The pastor, Father Mapple (Orson Welles) gives a sermon based on the story of Jonah and how after his earnest prayer he was saved from the great whale.The two pals encounter a man on the dock as they walk to board the Pequod, a man seeming either crazed or drunk (Royal Dano), and he makes a prophecy, that the day you smell land where there is no land, that day Ahab will meet his death, and after he will return and beckon others save one to follow him. When asked his name, he answers ""Elijah"".The ships second rank officers direct the first part of the voyage while Ahab stays in his quarters. The chief mate is Starbuck, (Leo Genn) a serious, sincere Quaker and fine leader; second mate is Stubb, happy-go-lucky, cheerful and forever smoking his pipe; the third mate is Flask (Seamus Kelly), a thoroughly reliable man who bullies anyone bigger than him. Each mate is responsible for a whaling boat, and each whaling boat of the Pequod has its own pagan harpooneer assigned to it.Some time after sailing, Ahab finally appears on the quarter-deck one morning, an imposing, frightening figure whose haunted visage sends shivers over the narrator. One of his legs is missing from the knee down and has been replaced by a prosthesis fashioned from a whale's jawbone. A long vertical scar from his hairline down to his chin gives his face a special character.Ahab orders the crew to gather, and in a rousing speech promises a Spanish ounce of gold to the crewman who first sights Moby Dick. His single, secret purpose for the voyage is hunting down and killing Moby Dick, an old, very large sperm whale, with a snow white hump and mottled skin, that crippled Ahab on his last whaling voyage. The gold coin is nailed to a mast in plain view as a reminder.In a scene in the Captain's quarters, Ahab explains to Starbuck that over the years he has gathered information on whale presence and migrations from many many whaling ships, and he has fashioned a map that he can use to predict where the whales might be at any time of year. According to his map, Moby Dick should be at Bikini Atoll by the following March.In another sequence, a whale is sighted, pursued in three small boats, and harpooned. The whale swims away towing the boats, and dives. One of the boats might be towed downwards into the deep, so the rope is cut. The whale eventually weakens as it bleeds, and it is killed. The carcass is cut into pieces, the blubber sliced and the oil rendered in large vats on the vessel. At the end of the work, the seamen celebrate.Eventually a day comes when Ishmael is given the opportunity to be the lookout from the top of the main mast. It isnt long before he sights a whale, in fact, a large group of whales. The whales are chased, and five of them are killed. The seamen, who will share in the profits from the value of the oil, are happy.However, Ahab hears from another passing ship that the white whale has been sighted. Immediately he orders a stop to the harvest work, and full sailing in the direction that he believes Moby Dick is traveling, much to the dismay of Stubb and the other seamen, who are shocked that the profit from the whales killed is abandoned.Only Starbuck offers any resistance to the charismatic but obsessed captain. The first mate argues repeatedly that the ships purpose should be to hunt whales for their oil, with luck returning home profitably, safely, and quickly, but not to seek out and kill Moby Dick in particular and especially not for revenge, as revenge is only for the Lord to take.Starbuck even dares to show to the other mates a book in which it is clearly written that if a Captain diverts resources to a private matter and neglects the commercial purpose of the enterprise, the other officers are justified in removing the Captain from his duties. However, Stubb and the other mates refuse to go along with even the planning of such an act. Eventually even Starbuck acquiesces to Ahab's will, suppressing his instincts.The custom of visiting with other whaling vessels met in the open sea is illustrated when the Pequod meets the Samuel Enderby. Captain Boomer (James Robertson Justice) has lost an arm to the whale, comes on board the Pequod for a friendly visit and interchange of news. For Ahab, however, there is but one relevant question to ask of another ship: Hast seen the White Whale? Captain Boomer is stunned at Ahab's burning need for revenge and soon ends their brief interchange.In another incident that emphasizes Ahabs obsession, when a man accidentally falls off the ship from a great height, he is unusually quick in making the decision that the man is dead and will not resurface. Ahab insists on resuming course without delay, to the dismay of Stubb and the seamen.Another day, Queequeg is throwing bone pieces on deck in what is evidently a fortune telling ritual. Suddenly, he stares at his bones, says Ah!, and insists on calling the ships carpenter. He places an order for a very long coffin with special carvings, a coffin that is to be pitched and caulked so as to be waterproof. He pays the carpenter, gives the rest of his money, his harpoon, and other property to Ishmael, and stops talking to anyone while just staring vacantly ahead.Queequeg persists in his catatonic state until much later. When a fight breaks out and Ishmael is in danger of being knifed to death, Queequeg jumps out of his stupor to protect him, and resumes his normal behavior.Next they meet the Rachel, from which Moby Dick has been seen very recently. As a result of the encounter, one of its boats is missing. The captains youngest son had been aboard. The Rachel's captain begs Ahab to aid in the search for the missing boat, but Ahab is resolute; the Pequod is very near the White Whale now and Ahab will not stop to help. He reasons that he will kill the whale that killed the captains son, and revenge should be the priority.The man at the mast sights the white whale, and Captain Ahab organizes a ceremony where the man is handed his Spanish doubloon.In the next sequence the Pequod goes right into a dangerous storm, as the captain refuses to take any course of evasion that would divert him away from Moby Dicks path. Despite extreme danger from strong winds, the captain insists on leaving full canvas on, even trying to replace a torn sail in the middle of the storm. Starbuck begs Ahab one final time to desist on his quest for vengeance, but to no avail. As the ship leaves the storm area, St. Elmos fire appears on the masts, and Captain Ahab shows that he can dominate the elements by his will as he extinguishes the glow from a harpoon he is holding.The next day, the Pequod meets Moby Dick. The Pequod's crew pursues the whale, which wreaks widespread destruction. Ahab ignores Starbucks pleas one more time, and continues with his ill fated chase. All three boats set out to harpoon him.Ahab harpoons the whale, but the harpoon line breaks. Moby Dick then rams the Pequod itself, which is heavily damaged. As Ahab harpoons the whale again, the unfolding harpoon rope catches him and he is entangled with other ropes hanging from harpoons that have remained stuck into Moby Dick from previous encounters.Even stuck to Moby Dick, Ahab stabs and stabs with all his energy trying to kill the whale while it thrashes about, upending the other boats, and diving deep into the sea. After Moby Dick returns to the surface, the crew still on boats see the dead Ahab stuck on the side of the whale, and one limp arm seems to wave, beckoning, even in death, thus fulfilling the mysterious prophecy of Elijah.Moby Dick destroys all boats. As the seamen struggle to stay on the surface, Moby Dick swims around and around the Pequod creating a whirlpool that catches the ship and draws it down slowly.Ishmael is on the surface, still swimming, when Queequegs special coffin bobs up from the deep. Ishmael is able to climb on top of the coffin and cling to it for a day and a half, at which time the Rachel comes upon the scene and he is rescued.Only Ishmael has survived to tell the tale."

tt0049646,"['Horror', 'SciFi']","The rocket, to a design reminiscent of every pulp comic book, ends up nose down in a field. Creating a wave of interest, the uniforms soon arrive, followed by our interpid hero (Prof Bernard Quartermass, Brian Donlevy) and his helpers in a early model VW people carrier. Also on board is an 'Astronauts Wife', and a man from the ministry (Blake, Lionel Jeffries).After some interplay between the uniforms and the scientists, the door to the rocket (amazingly visible just above ground level) is opened remotely. (Pity the poor fireman who seemed to be suffering a lack of pressure with his hose pipe - screen left at this critical moment). A single Astronaut rolls out of the door, and is greeted by his wife and Quatermass.He is whisked off in an ambulance (classic!) after Quatermass tries to glean some information from him about the rest of the crew, for by now it appears that there is no-one else on board - just two empty space suits.Headlines shown the next day indicate a mystery - and of course this leads to police involvement (they fingerprinted the poor bloke in the ambulance) led by Lomax of the Yard, played by that old stalwart copper, Jack Warner. The running gag here is that he is always trying to shave - watch toward the end of the film when the pressure builds, and he has a 9 o'clock shadow! Anyway, it appears that the Yard feel this is a murder enquiry, and Lomax's mood is not helped by the arrival in his office of Quatermass - a brusque initial exchange leads to an agreement of sorts, as Quatermass leaves full information on the three spacemen.Quatermass visits Victor Caroon (Richard Wordsworth) at the lab, and is disappointed to see that he still is not talking, although there are some strange marks appearing on his shoulder. The Wife arrives, and helps lead him to bed, to be monitored by the Professors able assistant.Inspector Lomax reappears in the Professors office, issuing the classic line ""no one wins in a cold war"", and shows that the fingerprints taken from the Astronaut in the ambulance are totally different from those provided by the Professor. The Professor indicates that '.... these are not human....!'At this stage, the Professors helper convinces him that he can no longer look after Caroon. He needs to be in a hospital, closely monitored and cared for. The professor concedes this point, so we next see the Wife and a helper outside the hospital in the rain, obviously trying to spring the poor bloke from his hospital bed. At one point, when the helper goes to get the lift, Caroon hits an innocent cactus plant so hard that the pot goes flying over the room - this has a bearing on subsequent events. After some light repartee, the helper, who seems to indicate that he is a PI of sorts, gets Caroon in the lift. All seems well, until the helper wants to know what he is hiding under his coat - and ends his role in the film for his trouble. Caroon leaves with his wife, and the body of the helper is found by a nurse with suitable screams.Caroon is seen with his wife, who thinks nothing of smoking and driving. She is rambling on about how she will look after him, when she also notices his hand under the coat, and pulls the car over. After Caroon shows her (but not the audience) his hand, she screams fit to burst whilst he makes his escape.Meanwhile, back a the hospital, all the main actors have arrived. The helper has had his skull caved in and is drained of blood.The police put out an APB for the missing man, whilst Quatermass tries to figure out what is going on. About now, a film from the space ship is finally processed, and in what is another key point in the film we are able to share with all the main actors some excellent effect work showing the three space men at work and play. It is obvious that something disabled the craft, finished off two of the Astronauts, and left Caroon with the mother of all problems.Caroon then proceeds to stumble around various locations; the chemists shop (with the actor who was to become Sam Pearson in Emmerdale Farm, Toke Townley) being erased; a young Jane Asher missing out on a similar fate whilst Caroon struggles with his metamorphis; and then London Zoo, where as we subsequently discover a number of animals do not manage to escape.As the creature mutates, it starts to leave a trail (evident at the Zoo) like a snail, but it seems that this is too obvious for the Police to follow. At the Zoo they discover a fragment of the creature, and back in the lab this seems to be self sufficient and develops in its own right. The danger is that the 'creature' can self procreate, and that within 24 hours London will be a morass of slithering life draining aliens.A young Thora Hird entertains as bag lady in the police station, but she is coherent enough to ensure that that Police arrive at the latest sighting point. This after mobilisation of the armed forces, all police, and the now disbanded Civil Defence units, who could find no trace. Good old Thora.It then seems that the 'trail' leads to Westminster Abbey, where we see the BBC Outside Broadcasting unit set up and about to give a live broadcast on the restoration work then being undertaken. The producer is played by Gordon Jackson (Upstairs, Downstairs (1971), The Professionals (1977)), and eventually the cameras focus on the Thing - how it managed to get onto that scaffolding remains a secret - but its there is all its gruesome glory. No trace of the astronaut remain - just scales, and eye, and thorns from the cactus.Some discussion takes place about the best way to terminate the creature without releasing spores all over London - eventually it is decided to route the entire elctricity grid to the Abbey to a cable that will be attached to the scaffolding. A great shot here of Battersea Power station (I wonder if that was the actual interior?), and when all the lights in old London town are dimmed and go out, the creature meets its maker. Frazzled.Quatermass ends by saying that he will 'start again'; Lomax hopefully gets the shave he has been after all through the film; and we have been wonderfully entertained in a classic of British mid-50's cinema. Enjoy."

His son is building a clubhouse with whatever lumber he can find and he admits to taking the slats. Dave offers to buy lumber but Andy says the fun is in finding it. So Dave promises to leave work early that day and bring some scavenged lumber. Edith hurriedly finds a clean shirt for Andy since it is time for school. Andy attends the exclusive Covey Lane Day School. Dave and his brother Al do not agree on how to run the company, but overall their relationship is good.

Edith sees the school bus stop down the street but it passes their house. Just as they are getting worried, the school calls to check on Andy. That morning a nurse from Dr. Gorman's office took Andy from school because the doctor needed to see him. Edith and Dave are mystified and telephone the doctor. He did not send his nurse for Andy and has no idea what they are talking about. At that point Andy's parents realize he has probably been kidnapped.The police are notified and arrive to set up a special phone for when a ransom call comes in.

Dave identifies the shirt as Andy's. The story leaks and the Stannards are overrun with reporters. They park outside the house, along with spectators who tear pieces from the fence for souvenirs. After careful soul-searching and believing he has little chance of getting Andy back whether he pays or not, Dave takes the money and goes to the local TV station. He spreads the money on a table and makes a public broadcast that no ransom will be paid for his son. Instead he offers it as a bounty on the kidnappers. A man sitting in an armchair next to a TV is partially shown, listening as Dave asks that the kidnappers do the right thing and set his son free.Back home, Dave is greeted by an hysterical Edith. She demands that he retract his statement and tries to go outside to talk to the reporters. But Dave won't allow it. He tries to explain why he reached that decision but Edith is not able to listen.

Musashi comes back to apologize and even kneels. The other man refuses to accept the apology and attacks with his kama-yari. Musashi grabs the long polearm and it becomes a struggle of wills. The old man who a year earlier had said Musashi lacked chivalry comes up and warns the opponent who he is facing. He stops the fight and declares Priest Agon the winner.Later, Musashi has dinner with the old man, a monk, who congratulates the samurai on his development.

Later in the day, Otsu arrives, and plans to follow.Edo is the most crowded city in Japan. Many samurai come to Edo looking for employment. Sasaki is having an audition match against a man Okaya, wielding a yari/spear. He confidently tells the other to remove the safety pad from the sharp end, and will use a wooden bokken himself.

Aaron is a little wary of Ethan, who has not been seen since the surrender of the Confederate Army, but his children -- Lucy, Ben and Debbie -- are all overjoyed to see him. So is Martha (Dorothy Jordan), Aaron's wife; she and Ethan clearly are in love though they cannot act on it. Aaron and Martha's adopted quarter Cherokee son Martin arrives for dinner. He greets Ethan but Ethan is very unhappy in his presence despite the fact that he is the one who found him abandoned as an infant. Martin and everybody else can see Ethan's dislike for him. As the night draws in,Martin sits outside on the porch feeling distant from the family in Ethan's presence. He goes to off to bed as do the other kids, and Aaron and Martha soon discover that Ethan is in possession of newly minted Northern money. Aaron agrees to hide the money for Ethan and tells him he is free to stay as long as he likes. Ethan knows his welcome is tenuous, however, and after everyone else goes to bed, sits alone on the porch.The next morning, the Reverend Captain Samuel Clayton (Ward Bond), the area's minister and captain of the Texas Rangers, comes with a posse to the farm. Someone has run off Lars Jorgensen's (John Qualen) cattle. Clayton deputizes Aaron and Martin to join the Rangers' posse. Ethan tells Aaron he is not to go but instead to stay close to home in case the cattle rustling was in fact a diversionary ploy by aggressive Native Americans. Clayton is glad to see his former compatriot in the Confederate Army but also mentions that Ethan matches the description of a lot of wanted criminals. Ethan agrees to go with the Rangers to search for the cattle but refuses to swear an oath to the state of Texas, believing that his oath to the Confederacy is sufficient.They ride off and follow the trail and it isn't long before Marty tries to share his concerns about what they are following with Ethan, but Ethan is dismissive because of Marty's biracial heritage. After several hours of riding, the posse finds Jorgensen's cattle slaughtered in the desert. They realize that a band of Comanche Indians have lured them away from their farms. Because Jorgensen's farm is closest, most of the posse rides there. Ethan, Marty and the slightly demented Mose Harper (Hank Worden) decide to ride for Aaron's farm. But Marty wants to ride off straight away and Ethan knows that the horses won't make it. They need resting for a while. Martin doesn't care and angrily rides off anyway. As dusk sets in,Aaron becomes suspicious at his farm as he hears noises in the distance.Fully aware of what Mose was saying about the Comanches, he and Martha try to stay calm in front of the kids while Aaron picks up a shotgun to pretend he's going to do some hens.Martha starts to close the windows and put out the lights.Lucy realises what is going on and starts to scream in terror.Martha slaps her and tries to calm her and comfort her. They get Debbie out of the window so that she can go off to safety while they prepare for the inevitable.Debbie runs off and sits by an headstone. A shadow looms over her. it is the chief of the tribe, Scar. He blows his horn to call his tribe. Early in the morning,Ethan and Mose ride along and see Martin stood wanting a ride from them. His horse has failed to make the journey but Ethan rides along passed him and Mose follows. Ethan sees that the ranch is burned down and rides down to try to find any survivors from the attack.Aaron, Martha and Ben have been slaughtered, and Lucy and Debbie are missing.As the funeral takes place and the people sing an hymn, Ethan becomes frustrated and just what's to get on with taking revenge. He tells Clayton to cut the prayer short so that they can go searching for Debbie and Lucy. They find a partially buried Indian corpse,who has died apparently from from been wounded during the attack. Ethan shoots the warrior's eyes out to further mutilate the corpse and prevent it from reaching the afterlife. Soon Ethan finds the Comanches setting up camp near a river 20 miles away from where the rest of the posse are.He returns to them and tells them they'll wait until nightfall and attack them. Clayton doesn't think it's a good idea because it could result in Lucy and Debbie been killed. Instead they slowly sneak in but find that they are gone.As they travel along the desert,the Comanches try to get the posse into a trap. They manage to make it to the other side of the river and fend them off in a gun battle,which results in one of them been wounded. As the Comnahces try to collect their dead and injured members,Ethan tries to shoot more of them but Clayton stops him. Full of rage, Ethan angrily tells them that he's going on alone to pursue them.Marty and Lucy's boyfriend Brad Jorgensen (Harry Carey, Jr.) want to join him.Ethan agrees on the condition that he's in charge.The three of them separate from the rest of them,who return home with the wounded member of the group.Soon Brad the Indians encampment one night, he believes he sees Lucy's distinctive dress. Ethan tells him that he found Lucy's defiled corpse in a canyon when the three men had split up to follow different trails. Insane with rage, Brad rides wildly into the Indian camp on his own.Marty tries to stop him but Ethan grabs him to prevent him following.Gunshots are heard in the distance and Brad is soon killed.Ethan and Marty continue on their search but as winter sets in, they lose their trail. They return to the Jorgensens' ranch. Marty has a tenuous romantic relationship with the Jorgensens' daughter, Laurie (Vera Miles). Mrs. Jorgensen gives Ethan a letter from a trader named Futterman who says he might have information about Debbie. Ethan arranges for Marty to stay with the Jorgensens but Marty wants to go with him. However in the morning, he discovers that Ethan has taken off on his own. Fearing that Ethan will kill Debbie if he finds her, he still takes off after him much to Laurie's displeasure.At Futterman's trading post he tells them that he purchased a swatch of calico print dress from an Indian band led by a war chief named Scar. Marty recognises it as Debbie's. Futterman tells them that she was taken by Scar,the chief of the Nawyecka tribe.Ethan pays Futterman part of the reward. He tells him he'll get the rest when and if they find Debbie.Futterman asks them if they want to stay the night but Ethan refuses. He knows Futterman is after his money.Later that night, Futterman and two accomplices follow Ethan and Marty for the rest of the money. But Ethan knows what they are up to. He leaves Marty by the camp fire to sleep while he goes to hide with a rifle,ready to take the men out. He shoots all three men in the back and retrieves his money from the dead body.Marty is angry that Ethan just left him for bait but Ethan just calmly tells him to get ready to move on.By now, the search for Debbie has continued for a year or more. Marty writes a letter to Laurie detailing his and Ethan's attempts to find Debbie.Charlie McCory delivers the letter and she reads it out loud to the family and narrates the next part of their journey.Ethan and Marty have traveled out of Texas into Colorado and parts north. Laurie is outraged to learn that Marty accidentally acquired an Indian bride, Look (Beulah Archuletta) while trying to trade for blankets with a different band of Comanche. Marty tried to drive her away but Ethan finds the situation amusing. When Look learned they were tracking Scar, she abandoned them in the night. They later found her in a Comanche camp that had been slaughtered by the American calvary. Marty and Ethan visited a local fort where white women who had been with the Comanche are, having been rescued by the cavalry. Ethan and Martin tell them that they are looking for a girl who was taken and will be around the age of 14 now. They are taken to three girls of that age,who appear to be deranged from their experiences but none of them are Debbie. One of the girls snatches Debbie's doll from Marty's hands and as she rocks with it back and forth, Ethan looks her horrified,thinking of what Debbie will be like if they find her.Laurie finshes reading the letter by telling everyone that Ethan and Marty are heading for the new territory. Laurie swears she will give up on Marty, which delights Charlie, who begins to serenade her.Five years later, Ethan and Marty are in New Mexico territory, where they find Mose in a cantina. He has met Figueroa, a merchant who trades with Scar's tribe. Figueroa takes them to meet Scar (Henry Brandon). Scar and Ethan are both annoyed to learn each speaks the other's language. In Scar's tent, Ethan and Marty see Debbie (Natalie Wood), now a teenager. They return to their own camp by a creek. Marty asks Ethan if Scar wants to kill them.Ethan reckons so and explains that the only reason he has let them escape with their lives for now is because of the Comanche code of honour. In the distance Debbie comes running down the sand dune to Marty. He begs her to try and remember him. She says she does but the Comanche are her people now and they must leave her. Ethan pulls out his gun and orders Marty to move away from her so that he can kill her but Marty blocks him. Just then, Scar's warriors attack and Ethan is wounded by a poisoned arrow. He and Marty ride off with the Indians in pursuit.They take cover in a cave and fend them off with their pistols.Ethan rests up,while Marty tends to him. Later,Ethan gives him a letter to read. He wants Marty to take all his possessions should he die but Marty isn't happy about it,as Debbie's his next of kin. But Ethan just considers her an indian now and not a relation.Marty refuses to accept it and tells him he hopes he dies.A while later, they return to the Jorgensens just as Laurie and Charlie are about to be married. They are just about to enter the house when Lars tries to stop them and tells them they are wanted for Futterson's death.He tells them to hide but Ethan walks in anyway to greet everyone.His return is met with silence. Marty is upset to find out that Laurie was going to marry someone else and shocked when he finds out it's Charlie.They end up having a fight and although neither man wins, the wedding is called off. Just as Clayton is about to arrest Ethan and Marty, a young calvary officer called Lt.Greenhill (Patrick Wayne) arrives with Mose who had been captured by Scar's tribe but managed to escape once they came close to the Jorgensens' farm. Clayton organizes his Rangers again and, with Ethan and Marty, they ride out to confront Scar.Ethan wants to charge into Scar's camp, hoping that Scar will kill Debbie so he doesn't have to. Marty persuades Clayton (who is in charge) to let him sneak into camp and rescue Debbie before the charge. When he does so, he has to keep her from screaming for help. Scar enters the tent but Marty beats him to the draw, killing him. Clayton, Ethan and the Rangers charge into the camp, killing or scattering the Comanche. Ethan finds Scar's body and scalps it.As he rides out of the tent holding the scalp, he sees Debbie in the distance.Fearing for her life she runs away and Ethan rides after her.Knocking Marty aside, he pursues near a cave. As she cowers, he reaches down and picks her up. Cradling her in his arms, he says, ""Let's go home, Debbie.""Ethan and Marty take Debbie back to the Jorgensens' ranch, where Lars, Mrs. Jorgensen, and Mose (sitting on the porch on a rocking chair) are waiting. They take her inside, followed by Marty and Laurie. Ethan stands outside, then turns and walks away as the door closes on him."

tt0049771,['Comedy'],"This movie was released by London Films, but it is a dinki-di Australian film.
Based on a 1945 novel by Moore Raymond, it is set in the fictional town of Murrumbilla.
We first see Smiley Greevins (Colin Petersen) sitting in a tree, pretending to be ""Captain Cook discovering Australia"".He is a boy with a vivid imagination and a whole world to explore. One of the enduring images of the film is the young boy in checked shirt and shorts racing on bare feet up the grassy hills nearby. He shares a secret waterhole with his friend Joey (Bruce Archer) where they fish and discuss the strange doings of the adults in the small town.
He is determined to buy himself a pushbike he has seen in a catalogue, but it costs four pounds, an impossible sum. But not impossible to a resourceful young lad, who picks up all sorts of jobs, helped by the adults around him.He begins his savings with sixpence from the Reverend Lambert (Ralph Richardson) for reciting some lines of catechism. Later, the reverend offers him the job of bellringer for the Sunday services, at ""one penny a tintinabulation"".The local policeman (Chips Rafferty) gives him a shilling for cutting up wood and splitting kindling and another bob for polishing the horse's bridle and harness. His teacher, Miss Workman (Jocelyn Hernfield) sends Smiley to the Headmaster (Charles Tingwell) for a caning, but after that is done, he gives him a shilling.However, he loses it all when he smashes a church window with a stone during a boys' mudfight. Devastated, he says he will do himself in. But the hotel proprietor, Mr. Rankin (John McCallum) sends him to the local Aboriginal camp on a secret mission for another shilling. Then the police sergeant finds him and Joey jobs at a local sheep station as rouse-abouts and they each earn three pounds. Joey buys a pony with his earnings, but Smiley does not have enough for a bike, because he lost five bob at two-up.His prayer at night is, ""Dear God, please help me to buy my bike before Dad comes home"". His father (Reg Lye) is a drover of cattle and an alcoholic, not to be trusted with money. His mother (Margaret Christensen) is overworked and embittered by her lonely existence. When his father comes home, he gives Smiley the final pound note he needs to buy the bike. But while he is at the Aboriginal camp again, his father loses his own money at two-up, and he takes Smiley's four pounds from under his pillow and loses it as well.Smiley, in his anger, bashes the bed with a cricket bat and accidentally hits his father in the head. Thinking he has killed him, he runs away into the bush. After a night lost in the bush, the town's menfolk form a search party to find him. But Smiley has met an English boundary-rider, and tells him he has a 1000 pounds reward on his head for murder. When Smiley is bitten by a snake, the boundary rider rushes him back to town.The boy recovers and the townsfolk surprise him with a brand new bike. In the final scene of the film, he rides down the street, racing Joey on the pony."

A fight breaks out as the two crews change over.In another part of the installation the main office is informed that mine number 8 has filled with water. One of the engineers Shigeru Kwamura (Kenji Sahara) goes down to investigate; the last survey didnt reveal any problems. When he arrives at the shaft he discovers two of the miners are trapped by the waterShigeru calls for a couple of volunteers and they head down the tunnel to rescue the men. Yoshi is the first one found; he appears unconscious and close to death. Hes quickly rushed to the hospital and the doctors are concerned about a strange head wound they have found.There is no news about the other man, Goro. Some of the miners think Goro tried to kill Yoshi because of the earlier fight in the assembly area. Leaving the hospital Shigeru encounters his girlfriend Kiyo (Yumi Shirakawa) who is also Goro's sister. She fears the stories of his crime are true bit Shirakawa insists that she wait till more information is availableBack in the flooded tunnel the search for Goro goes on. One of the men thinks they hear something and investigate. Getting closer to the source of the noise they hear other strange sounds. Suddenly two of the men are dragged below the water but a third escapes. He tries to phone for help but is killed.Later the bodies of the three men are recovered. They seem to have suffered the same injuries as Yoshi. The doctor seems to doubt Goro could have committed the murders; the strength involved would be beyond anything he was capable of.That night Shigeru goes and comforts Kiyo as rumors spread through the village about her brother. As they sit and talk a huge caterpillar like creature crashes into the house, the couple escape and summon the police. They confront the creature but a forced back.The village is alerted to the danger and the mine workers go to try and stem the threat. They spot the creature climbing a hill outside the village and head off in pursuit. Thinking they have the creature cornered they open fire, with little effect. The creature attacks two of the men and kills them, but in the process it loses its footing and slides down the hill into darkness and escapes.Later it is reported the creature was seen entering one of the older mine shafts. The police begin sealing the entrance as they wait for the military to arrive. A detachment of soldiers arrives and confidently enters the tunnel in search of the creature. Finding Goro's body they set up a machine gun while the creature advances. Despite their best efforts the creature continues to advance. Shigeru hits on the idea of sending one of the mine trains into the tunnel. At first his plan seems to work but the creature revives. The machine gun opens fire again causing a cave in that traps Shigeru and apparently kill the creature.Later Professor Kashiwagi arrives and reviews the evidence. He believes the creature is a ""meganuron"", the nymph of a dragonfly, possibly hatched from an egg buried somehow in the mineAn earthquake hits the area and substantial sections of the local mountains subside destroying the only road to the mines. Amid one of the landslides, Shigeru is found, dazed and with a broken arm. At the hospital Shigeru appears non responsive as if in some kind of shock. A doctor suggests he is suffering from amnesia The doctors try to trigger his memory by showing him images of the monster he may have encountered in the mine.At the same time an air force pilot encounters a UFO and as he is pursuing it he informs his base that the object is performing incredible manuvers. Unfortunately as the pilot is chasing the object it does a sharp u-turn and flies so close that the plane breaks up and the only things recovered are his oxygen mask and bloody helmet. They then are informed that a BOAC flight was also attacked by the UFO and was destroyed leaving no survivors. Soon there are reports of the UFO attacking various cities throughout Asia; including Beijing and Manilla.Back in Kyushu, two honeymooners head off for a trip after being recently married. Both are friends of Sunagawa, the seismologist who first informed Kashiwagi and the authorities of the mysterious new activity at Mt. Aso. They stop at a volcanic crater and begin photographing each other, when suddenly a bird-like creature flies low overhead killing them instantly. The camera the couple where using is retrieved and an image of the creature has been captured.The next day the police and Kashiwagi question Sunagawa about his friend and as they are talking to him one of the lab attendants come out with the freshly developed roll and as they are looking at it they see a mysterious shadow and when they make a print of it they see that it is the wing tip of a gigantic bird. Kashiwagi, who happened to have some pictures with him from his recent visit to Shigeru, takes out the drawing of a pteranadon and compares it to the pic and it is almost identical. However, Kashiwagi knows that Shigeru is the key and he is the one who can tell the authorities what he saw.At the hospital Shigeru has a breakthrough when his girlfriend shows him a nest with eggs hatching. He begins to recall seeing a nest with large numbers of odd creatures as well as one giant egg off by itself. As he watches the egg hatches and a Rodan is born. It immediately begins eating the other creatures in the cave. The scientists return to the mineshaft to try and gather more information, if what Shigeru says is correct they should be in no danger from the caterpillar-like creatures, and they believe Rodan has left the nest. They return to the spot indicated by Shigeru and find a piece of eggshell before having to leave due to a cave in.They study the shell fragment and discover the original egg was massive. At a briefing they give details of the size of a fully grown Rodan. Its wingspan should be upwards of 270 meters and have a body weight in excess of 100 tons. Aside from the danger of being eaten they realize the sonic boom created when the creature flies will be fatal to huge numbers of people.Professor Kashiwagi goes on to explain that he believes Rodan now exists because of atomic tests. He explains that radioactive rainwater may have seeped into the underground caverns and caused a mutation. He then suggests a probable search area based around the two mines that had suffered previous attacksFollowing up on the lead the army sends a team to investigate. They witness Rodan breaking through to the surface and taking flight. His supersonic flight is as dangerous as predicted and he destroys a vehicle trying to fleeThe Japanese Air Force attempt to intercept the creature and a dog fight ensues but Rodan clearly out flies the pilots destroying a number of aircraft in the process.Alarms sound in nearby towns as Rodan flies off and the jets try to keep up. The jets close on the creature and seem to shoot it down. As the pilots go in to confirm the kill Rodan takes flight again, apparently uninjured.
Surrounding towns again set their alarms and people try to make for any shelter they can. The creature lands in the center of the city and begins to level everything with its powerful wings. The army sees a chance and deploys a number of tanks and rocket launchers to fight the animal.After absorbing a frightful barrage from the army units Rodan again flaps its wings cause cyclonic winds to sweep everything before it. A second Rodan arrives and begins circling the city helping to spread the destruction. As quickly as they came they fly off as night fallsLater at a planning meeting, it is agreed that both animals are nesting somewhere in the Mount Aso area, probably close to the volcanoes. A helicopter is dispatched and a sighting of both birds roosting in the crater are confirmedA plan is organized to bombard the crater; the hope is to bury both Rodans in the throat of the volcano. Military vehicles move into position as the remaining population is evacuated. Once everyone is too safety the attack beginsPart way through the attack reports come in that the intense bombardment is weakening the mountain and the volcano may erupt.Ultimately the volcano does explode and the two creatures take flight, one is caught by the eruption and killed.

tt0049833,"['Adventure', 'Drama']","The film covers the life of Moses from his discovery in a basket floating on the Nile as a baby by Bithiah, a childless young widow and daughter of the then-Pharaoh, Rameses I, to his prohibition from entering the land of Israel in the wake of God's judgment on him at the waters of Meribah. In between, the film depicts the early adulthood of Moses as a beloved foster son of Pharaoh Seti I (brother of Bithiah) and general of his armies, his romance with Throne Princess Nefertari (or Nefretiri, as she is called in the film) and rivalry with the Pharaoh's own son, Prince Rameses II.Shortly after Moses' birth, Rameses I had ordered the slaying of all firstborn male Hebrews to prevent the prophecy of the Deliverer from coming true. Moses' mother (called ""Yoshebel"" in the film) had set him adrift on the Nile to escape, with his sister Miriam watching from a hidden spot. Bithiah discovers the Ark while playing with other young women in the banks of the Nile. She orders them to leave, then shows her servant Memnet the baby. Memnet warned Bithiah that the swaddling cloth was Levite, so the baby was placed there to escape Bithiah's father's edict. But Bithiah declared that this baby would be her son, and remembered when the pyramids were dust, and named ""Moses"" because she had drawn him from the Nile (the Hebrew name ""Moshe"" derived from the Hebrew word ""Mashu"", meaning ""to draw""). Despite Memnet's protests about serving a son of Hebrew slaves, Bithiah ordered her to serve him and to swear to secrecy on pain of death. But Memnet hides the cloth under her clothes.As a young general, Moses is victorious in a war with the Nubian people of ancient Ethiopia, loosing captured ibises to combat the serpents (as recorded by Josephus) and further impresses Seti I by being wily enough to enter into an alliance with the conquered Ethiopians rather than subjugate them. Moses then is charged with building a treasure city for Seti's Jubilee, that Rameses failed to complete (probably the Biblical treasure cities of Pithom and Ramases (Avaris)).Meanwhile, Moses and Nefretiri are deeply in love; she is the ""throne princess"", who must marry the next Pharaoh. Rameses wants her for himself, not because of any liking for her but for the throne, but Nefretiri hates him.When Moses assumes control of the project, he rescued an old grease-woman from being left to be crushed; unknown to him it was his birthmother Yoshebel. Moses tells the Egyptian Master Builder Baka, ""blood makes poor mortar"" and asks ""are you a master builder or a master butcher?"" And he frees Joshua the stonecutter who had struck an Egyptian, punishable by death, to try to save Yoshebel whom Joshua didn't know. Moses was impressed with Joshua's bravery and words, and institutes numerous reforms concerning the treatment of the slave workers such as one day in seven to rest and even going so far as to raid temple granaries for necessary food supplies. Moses questions Joshua about his God, and Joshua declares his strong faith but says that God's name is unknown.Rameses uses these changes as proof that Moses is planning an insurrection by currying the slaves' favor, and points out that the slaves are calling Moses the ""Deliverer"" of prophecy. However, when Seti confronts Moses, Moses argues he is simply making his workers more productive by making them stronger and happier. He proves his point with such impressive progress on the project that Seti becomes convinced that Rameses falsely accused his foster brother. Seti promises that Moses will get credit for the new city. Rameses, meanwhile, has been charged by his father with the task of finding out if there really is a Hebrew fitting the description of the Deliverer, and is having no luck.As Nefretiri is joyously preparing for marriage, Memnet informs her that Prince Moses is not a prince at all, but the son of Hebrew slaves. Nefretiri is furious at the accusation, whereupon Memnet produces the Levite cloth and tells Nefretiri to wrap their firstborn in it. Memnet also tells her that a little girl had led her to Yochebel to breastfeed Moses, which she realized must be the real mother. Nefretiri kills Memnet by pushing her over the balcony.Moses learns of this, so asks Bithiah, who dissembles and reminds him of how he never doubted her when he held his hand as he took his first step. When Moses leaves, promising that no matter what he found, he would always love her. She rushes in a chariot to Yoshebel. Bithiah pleads with her not to reveal anything, since she has put the throne of Egypt within his grasp, and also declares how much she loved and cared for him, and promised to free them and make sure they were well cared for. But Moses had followed from a distance, and Yoshebel could not look him in the eyes and deny that she was his mother. And her robe matched the pattern of the much more faded Levite cloth Memnet kept. Then Yoshebel's adult children introduce themselves to Moses as, ""I am your brother, Aaron,"" and ""I am Miriam, your sister."" Bithiah sadly departs.Declaring he is not ashamed (""Egyptian or Hebrew, I'm still Moses""), but curious, he spends time working among the slaves to learn of their hardship, only to be rescued from the mudpits by Nefretiri. Moses then saves Joshua, a Hebrew stonecutter, from being whipped death at the hands of Baka; he kills Baka who was about to whip Joshua to death. Dathan, the devious and ambitious Hebrew overseer who's been charged by Rameses to help him find the Deliverer, watches from hiding. Moses confesses to Joshua that he himself is Hebrew; Joshua excitedly proclaims Moses the Deliverer, and although Moses denies it, Dathan has all the proof he needs. Revealing what he knows to Rameses, Dathan bargains for Baka's house, a post as Governor of Goshen and the ownership of Joshua's betrothed Lilia.Moses is arrested and brought in chains before Seti, who begs him to say he is not the Deliverer. Moses does so, but avows that he would free the slaves if he could. Bithiah confesses to her brother Seti that she took Moses from the Nile knowing by the design on his blankets that he was Hebrew. In a short, impassioned speech, Moses says that it is evil to enslave or oppress people, ""to be stripped of spirit, and hope and faith, all because they are of another race, another creed. If there is a God, He did not mean this to be so!"" Seti is grievously hurt, since he said that he had always loved him as a son, more than his own real son Rameses. So Seti imprisons him and orders his name stricken from all records and monuments, to be unspoken in Egypt forever thereafter. Rameses banishes Moses to the desert, fearing to execute him lest he create a martyr. Meanwhile, Seti proclaims Rameses to be the next Pharoah. Nefretiri as the Throne Princess is required to marry the arrogant prince, to her great distress.Moses makes his way across the desert, nearly dying of hunger and thirst. He comes to a well in the land of Midian. After drinking and eating dates from a nearby palm tree he passes out, to be awakened by the sound of seven sisters watering their flocks. Bullying Amalekites appear, pushing the girls aside, whereupon Moses wakes. Seemingly appearing out of nowhere he thrashes the Amalekites soundly with his staff, forcing them to wait their turn at the well. Moses finds a home in Midian with the girls' father Jethro, a Bedouin sheik, who reveals that he is a follower of ""He who has no name"", which Moses recognized as the God of Abraham. Jethro explains that they are the descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's first-born. Moses later impresses Jethro and the other shieks with his wise and just trading, so Jethro offers Moses one of his daughters as a wife. Moses chooses the eldest daughter, called Sephora in the film (the Greek form of her name), the least flamboyant but wisest, who was previously the one who had stood up to the Amalekites.Back in Egypt, Seti dies heartbroken, with Moses' name on his lips, and Rameses succeeds him as Pharaoh (becoming Rameses II), taking Nefretiri as his Queen. Herding sheep in the desert, Moses finds Joshua, who has escaped from hard labour in the copper mines. Moses sees the Burning Bush on the summit of Mount Sinai; climbing up to investigate, he hears the voice of God. Naming himself ""I Am That I Am"", God charges Moses to return to Egypt and free His chosen people.At Pharaoh's court, Moses comes before Rameses to win the slaves' freedom, turning his staff into a snake to show Rameses the power of God. Jannes and another magician do the same, but Moses's snake eats the others (not shown; the small son of Rameses and Nefretiri tells his mother with alarm). But the Pharaoh decrees that the Hebrews be given no straw to make their bricks, but to make the same tally as before on pain of death. As the Hebrews prepare to stone Moses in anger, Nefretiri's retinue rescues him; but when she attempts to resume their relationship, he spurns her, reminding her that not only is he on a mission, having been touched by God, but that he is also married.As Moses continues to challenge Pharaoh's hold over his people, Egypt is beset by divine plagues. We see the water turned into blood, and hear of others. But Rameses hears of a naturalistic explanation of a mountain beyond the Nile cataract spewing red mud, although this would not have explained what the film showed: the red colour starting from where Aaron's stick touched the river and moving away, or the water in pitchers turning red as it was poured. but given this explanation, Rameses declared it not surprising that fish would die and frogs leave the water, and flies would bloat upon their carcasses and spread disease. So Moses predicts hot hail and three days of darkness; the hot hail comes shortly after and bursts into flame on the ground. Moses warns that the next plague would come from his own lips.Enraged at the plagues and Moses' continuous demands, and at his generals and advisers telling him to give in. Rameses orders all first-born Hebrews to die, but just as Moses had foretold, this intention backfires. Although Nefretiri warns Sephora to escape with Gershom on a passing caravan to Midian, Moses tells her sadly that it is her own son who will die, and he cannot save him. In an eerily quiet scene, the Angel of Death creeps into Egyptian streets in a glowing green cloud, killing all the firstborn of Egypt, including the adult son of Pharaoh's top general, and Pharaoh's own child. Meanwhile, Bithiah is released to Moses.Broken and despondent, Pharaoh orders Moses to take ""your people, your cattle, your God and your pestilence"" and go. Dathan is also ordered out when the Egyptian guards sees the sacrifice lamb's blood on the sides of his door frame, his position as an overseer counting for nothing with the Egyptians, the Hebrews resentful of him and refusing him the privileges he expects. The Exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt begins. Behold His mighty hand!Goaded into rage by Nefretiri in her grief and anger at Moses, the Pharaoh arms himself and gathers his armies to chase the former slaves to the shore of the Red Sea. Held back by a pillar of fire, the Egyptian forces can only watch as Moses parts the waters (""Behold His mighty hand!"") to provide his people an escape route. As the Hebrews race over the seabed, the pillar of fire dies down and the army rides in hot pursuit. The Hebrews make it to the far shore just in time to witness God's closing of the waters on the Egyptian army, drowning every man and horse. Rameses looks on in despair. All he can do is return to Nefretiri, confessing to her, ""His god is God.""The former slaves camp at the foot of Sinai and wait as Moses again ascends the mountain. When Moses delays coming down from Sinai, the Hebrews lose faith and, urged on by the evil Dathan, build a golden calf as an idol to bear before them back to Egypt, hoping to win Rameses' forgiveness. Aaron is forced to help fashion the gold plating. He also orders Lilia to be sacrificed. The people proceed to indulge their most wanton desires in an orgy of sinfulness. Sephora, now re-united with Moses, tells the people that he has gone to receive God's Law, and Bithiah asks, ""Would the God who's shown you such wonders let Moses die before his work his done?"" But their defences are mostly disregarded after Dathan's demagoguery.Meanwhile, high atop the mountain, Moses witnesses God's creation of the stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments. When he finally climbs down, Moses beholds his people's iniquity and hurls the tablets at the idol in a rage. The idol explodes, and Dathan and his followers (such as Korah) are killed, a burning crevasse swallows all who do not join Moses at his side. After God forces them to endure forty years' exile in the desert wandering lost to prove their loyalty, the Hebrews finally are on the eve of arriving in the land of Israel. An elderly Moses then appoints Joshua to succeed him as leader (with Lilia by Joshua's side), says a final good bye to his devoted wife Sephora, and goes forth out of Israel to his destiny."
tt0049844,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'Approved']","Steve Bradford, a wealthy middle-aged businessman, returns to the midwest orphanage where his illegitimate son was given up for adoption twenty years earlier. He wants to find the boy; not to take him from his adoptive parents but to give him all the financial advantages he is now able to offer. Miss Dempster, the orphanage director, explains that this won't be possible since adoption records are sealed. She regrets that he has come all that way for nothing. But Steve doesn't intend to give up. While waiting for Miss Dempster, he makes friends with a sixteen year old girl named Suzie. She is obviously pregnant and cries at the thought of having to give up her baby. Steve asks about her parents and is told they don't know where she is because she didn't want to disgrace them. Steve learns that the boy came to the orphanage a few years ago asking about his birth mother. He decides to find her himself and goes to the nearby college alumni office. The address they have on file is an old one and Steve knows she is no longer there. He recalls that she had a sister and obtains her address, which is out of state. Before leaving on the next plane, he telephones his New York lawyer and orders him to fly out. He finds the sister and she recognizes his name. She tells him that his former girlfriend married, had several children and is now dead. Not even her husband knew she had given birth to a child out of wedlock. She begs Steve to leave well enough alone. Steve's lawyer is shocked to hear the story and warns him that if it ever goes public, he will be disgraced. But Steve doesn't care. He wants his lawyer to work with the local attorney and find a loophole by which he can learn his son's identity. Meanwhile, Steve gets better acquainted with Miss Dempster and learns she was born at the orphanage, which explains her fierce dedication to her job. They discuss Suzie and what will happen to her and her baby. There is a court hearing concerning Suzie the next day and Steve decides to drop in. He learns that everything Suzie told him was a lie. Her parents are dead and her only living relative is an uncle who doesn't want her. The baby's father refused to marry her because he didn't believe the child was his. Steve sees a parallel between them, as he had said the same thing to his girlfriend twenty years earlier. Suzie tells the judge she wants to give her baby up for adoption. He asks if she is sure she knows what she is doing, for that will mean she will never see the child again. She breaks down and cries, but does not waver in her decision.Miss Dempster explains to Steve that the rules are made to protect the child and adoptive parents. If they made an exception for him, they would have to do so for everyone. She even resists Steve's bribe to build a new dormitory for the orphanage if she will bend the rules. Then a phone call changes everything. Steve's lawyer has found a loophole and there is a court hearing scheduled. Miss Dempster turns ice cold and orders Steve to leave her house. At the hearing, Miss Dempster is nearly found in contempt for failing to bring the paperwork concerning the boy's adoption. She is ordered to produce the documents that afternoon. But when court readjourns, she is absent. Her lawyer explains that one of the children at the orphanage was seriously injured and had to go to the hospital. Miss Dempster will be in court as soon as possible. The loophole Steve's lawyer has found is that his client was never notified of the adoption, which is against the rules. The document Miss Dempster produces, which had only just arrived, is the record of an interview between Steve and the welfare board, twenty years earlier. He was quoted as saying he didn't want the child because he didn't believe he was the father. Based on that interview, the judge rules in Miss Dempster's favor.Steve is heartbroken but it's his own fault. He should have told his lawyer about the interview instead of conveniently forgetting about it. There is nothing more he can do. Miss Dempster is waiting for him outside the courthouse. Suzie was hit by a car while crossing the street. She is in serious condition. They hurry to the hospital where the doctor tells them that Suzie might survive if she agrees to have surgery. But she is afraid that the baby will be harmed. Steve convinces her to have the operation and promises to wait in the lobby until it is over.Miss Dempster sees Steve in a new light, taking pity on him at last. After the surgery and the birth of a healthy son to Suzie, he leaves the hospital and stops at a bowling alley. He doesn't notice that he is followed by a young man. They strike up a conversation and the man reveals that he is Mark, Steve's son. Miss Dempster called and told him Steve was in town. They bowl for a few minutes and then go to a coffeeshop. Conversation is stilted and awkward. Mark had always been curious about his birth father. He wants nothing from Steve, who apologizes for running out on him. Mark works as a printer for his adoptive father and next year, when he is twenty-one, he will get a share of the business. Just then a juke box starts playing and it is too loud for conversation. They walk outside and shake hands, knowing that they will likely not meet again. Back at the orphanage, Miss Dempster tells Steve that Mark liked him. He had already called and told her how their meeting went. Then Steve asks about Suzie and is told that adoptive parents have already been found for her baby. There seems to be something Miss Dempster wants to say but she only looks at Steve in a meaningful way. Two weeks later, Steve is packing to leave. He telephones his secretary and orders her to buy a Christmas tree and decorations for his home. Then he takes a cab to the orphanage, ordering the driver to wait. Miss Dempster is smiling and very excited, stating that this is the greatest event the orphanage has ever had. The judge from the court hearing is there, along with Suzie's doctor. Then Suzie come downstairs with the baby. Steve has adopted them both and Suzie won't have to give up her baby. He learns that the baby's name is Steve. The new family gets into the cab and drives away."
tt0049845,"['Drama', 'Mystery']","In Central London in the middle of the night; we see the large premises of Stone and Company, Long Acre. Inside a man is stealthily proceeding towards one of the offices; we don't see his face, but he is carrying an attach√© case and wearing gloves. He enters an office where there is a safe, and he produces a key and opens it.
At Scotland Yard Information Room, a recorded announcement is received by telephone, stating that ""burglars have entered"". A radio message is passed to a police patrol car, and the officers go to the premises. The intruder hears them arrive and hastily removes money and closes the safe. The police don't see anything amiss from the outside, but then a man opens the main door and asks what the trouble is. He says he hasn't seen any disturbance and asks them in. They check the safe and everything seems to be all right. The man gives his name, Leslie Clark, and his address.
The police are satisfied, but call in a technician to reset the alarm; they do this without contacting the management of the premises. He soon completes his work and they all leave.
The next morning, we are in the home of Detective Superintendent Halliday; he has just had breakfast with his wife and young son. The boy is interested in his father's work. Halliday leaves and we see him arriving at Scotland Yard. He is reporting progress on various cases to his chief. The chief tells him that a new detective sergeant, named Ward, has been assigned to assist him. A call comes in about the robbery at Stone and Company; ¬£8,000 was stolen.
Halliday goes to his office and the new man Ward is sitting at Halliday's desk reading through papers concerning current cases. Halliday bristles at this a little. In fact Ward is exceptionally keen and exceptionally well briefed, which makes Halliday slightly resentful.
Halliday and Ward arrive at the offices of Stone and Company, and meet Mr Stone, the proprietor. As they shake hands, Halliday stares intently for a few seconds into Stone's face, disconcerting him. Stone introduces a Mr Creasey who is with him; Creasey represents the Bristol and Birmingham Insurance Company.
The safe is examined; it was locked after the money was taken, and there are no useful fingerprints. Stone says that there are two keys to the safe. Halliday asks Stone to arrange for his staff to present themselves for their fingerprints to be taken, although there are no prints on the safe. While Stone is out of the room, Creasey insists to Halliday that the safe was opened with a key, which Halliday considers already obvious, and there is further ill feeling in the room when Stone and Creasey both imply that the police were excessively slow to respond to the burglar alarm. Halliday tells them that the response was in one minute and thirty seconds, and the antagonism is increased.
Stone is back in the room and mentions that there was more money in the safe than in the past, but that there was no night watchman; he was in hospital. After some time, the police are leaving and Halliday takes the opportunity to challenge Stone; he didn't report the absence of the night watchman.
The police officer who responded at the time of the alarm is at the Criminal Records Office, but can't identify the man who was posing as the night watchman from existing photographs and descriptions.
Halliday invites Ward to join him for a sandwich and a beer for lunch at a pub round the corner, but Ward politely declines; lunch once a week is about the only chance he has to see his girlfriend.
That evening Ward talks to a regular informant; the man says it must have been an inside job because the safe had plenty of money in it; several underworld people had considered Stone's but there was never enough money in the safe to make the risk worthwhile. Ward reports back to Halliday and they agree that Stone himself could be an informant to whoever took the money, so as to claim the insurance money. Halliday agrees there is nothing more they can do that evening; he will go now and catch the 9:48 pm train home to Bromley.
He gets home and his wife is unhappy that he is so late and didn't bother to phone to tell her; their son is excited because Halliday is taking him to Farnborough Air Display the next day, but Halliday now says that he can't do so, because of the Stone's case. The boy is very disappointed, and Halliday tells him an exciting, but imaginary, story about a new case. Halliday's wife and he have a mild argument about the dangers of his job.
Halliday is prompted to think that the safe-breaker was someone unknown to the police, and although the time must now be about 11:00 pm, telephones Chief Superintendent Malcolm, and asks to meet him at the Criminal Records Office in about an hour's time. When they get there, Malcolm searches the records for cases outside London (where Halliday would remember the case) where the safe was opened by unknown means. They find little information of use, until they discover that all the safes in corresponding cases were made by the same company, Rock.
Halliday visits the company's offices in Chester, and gets a list of all the men who have worked on safes at the company. The Managing Director marks some of them as retired, and crosses one through as he has died. In the police offices in Chester, no information on criminal activities by any of the men has come to light.
Halliday and Ward return to London and speculate that their quarry might repeat the theft. In the middle of the night we are outside the Blackwall Shipping Company's premises. A man climbs on to the roof and descends through a skylight. He opens the safe with a key, and climbs the main gates back to the street. Meanwhile a young man has got up early to walk to work; he tells his wife he will be back by 12:30. As he walks, he sees the thief climbing out of the shipping yard, and getting in to a car that is waiting for him. It drives off and the young man tries to stop it, but it runs him down.
In the daytime, the police go to the shipping company; ¬£6,000 was taken. The safe was made by Rock. Halliday is told about the young man, who was knocked down at 4:30 am; he is regaining consciousness in hospital. Halliday and Ward go to the hospital, but the man is very weak. He manages to tell Halliday that he saw a man coming from the shipping office and get into the car, which ran him down. The man isn't able to explain much more.
The man's wife comes and as Halliday is leaving, she asks him what is happening, and she goes to her husband. Back at Scotland Yard, Halliday agrees with his chief that the young man's death, if that happens, will be murder. A policeman comes in then and says that the man has in fact died. At the end of the day, Halliday takes Ward into a pub, and gets sandwiches, and a lemonade for the teetotal Ward. When Halliday gets home very late, his wife has made sandwiches for him, which he can't face.
Next day at a scrap yard, two small boys try to get some money for a car fog lamp. A passing policeman asks them about it, and eventually one of them takes him to another scrap yard where a car has been dumped. The policeman reports it to higher authority, and a Ford Pilot car is found there with damage corresponding to the hit and run collision. There is blood and a fragment of cloth. In examining the car, they discover a woman's powder compact and an old newspaper. They check the registration number of the car, and it belongs to a different model altogether. Back at Scotland Yard they examine the vehicle excise licence disc for the car, and discover a different number, KLX774 has been erased. The car was hired, and reported stolen by a Mrs Elliott.
Halliday looks at the screwed-up newspaper, a ""Daily Mail"", that was found in the car; a pencil mark on the front appears to read ""Grange"", presumed to be the newsagent's delivery instruction.
Ward is sent to the newspaper offices; a manager there examines code markings printed on the newspaper, and can narrow the distribution area down to a relatively limited part of North Wales. Ward is sent to Manchester to find out the distribution; the Manchester newspaper company manager gives Ward a list of wholesalers, and in due course, retailers.
Mrs Elliot has come in to see Halliday and she identifies the powder compact as hers. She is sympathetic about the murdered man and gives Halliday ¬£5 for the widow.
In North Wales a constable is at a newsagent's, and a woman there identifies a photograph of the inscription ""Grange"" on the newspaper as being written by her boss. But the word is ""Garage"", not Grange. The information is phoned through to Scotland Yard. Halliday tells Ward they will have to go to the place where the small garage is located.
Mr Thomas is the owner. He identifies the paper as his, but when he is not direct in his answers, Halliday is rather acid with him. However they look in the day-book, but there was not work done on a Ford Pilot. He didn't do the crossword himself, but surmises that a customer did it; it was a Mr Brotherton, whom he took to the railway junction station. Brotherton had left for good. He caught the 9:50 am train. Halliday looks at the list of locksmiths, but there is no Brotherton. Halliday now surmises that the man supposedly dead, and crossed off the list, was ""Brotherton"".
At the Rock Safe offices, Halliday gets more detail that leads to a man Gilson, who retired a couple of years previously. Halliday and Ward return to London on the night train. Halliday speculates that Gilson had lived quietly all his working life, but he made extra keys for all the safes.
Their train pulls in to Birmingham station, and Ward goes to telephone his girlfriend, and Halliday suddenly thinks he could ring his wife. It is the middle of the night, but she is pleased to hear from him. There is news about their son's schooling, and Halliday nearly misses the train listening to it.
Now in Shepperton, an estate agent is telling Halliday and Ward about the house in Shepperton where Gilson moved to. The man explains how Gilson died of drowning in Cornwall, but the body was never found. Mrs Gilson then left the house to live elsewhere. Halliday goes to the house and speaks to the former maid to Gilson. The woman thinks the Gilsons were mean, but Mrs Gilson had hinted that she expected to come into money.
Halliday now goes to Somerset House, where records of deaths are kept, but there is no record of Gilson's death. The Assistant Commander at Scotland Yard is anxious for the case to be cleared up, and this reminds Halliday about Stone's insurance claim from Creasey. He goes to Stone, who says that Creasey had paid up the insurance claim without much investigation, and also that Creasey knew that the night watchman at Stone's was in hospital. Creasey is now under suspicion as the informant.
Halliday is sure that Gilson will be attempting another safe robbery. It emerges that the Royal Festival Hall (a theatre complex in London) is likely to have large sums in the safe after certain gala performances in the near future. It is probable that Gilson would be interested in robbing their safe. Halliday speaks to the manager there, and he says that Creasey has already spoken to him, but that his company puts its business elsewhere. However Halliday persuades him to see Cressey again and imply that he might put the business to him.
The manager soon rings back and says that he has given Creasey the business, and that he has told him the key nights.
On the first night, Halliday and Ward hide in the room at the Festival Hall where the safe is located, but no-one attempts a robbery. Creasey is being tailed by the police, and eventually we see that he meets with a woman in a department store. The woman is followed to Crispin Court, where Mrs Elliot lives. Back at Scotland Yard Yard and Halliday discuss the matter: Mrs Elliot must be Mrs Gilson; she hired the car, and Gilson came up from North Wales by train and they met up. The compact left in the car by Mrs Elliot was a ruse to establish credibility ""if anything went wrong"".
The maid who worked for Mrs Elliot is brought up to watch at Crispin Court, and when Mrs Gilson came out, the woman identifies her. So Mrs Elliot became Mrs Gilson.
The next day is Halliday's son's birthday, but Halliday has to go to work and leave the son at a children's party. Halliday is at the Festival Hall for the last night of the gala performances. With Ward he is once again waiting in the room where the safe is located. At the end of a long evening, everyone is going home, but a sports car is driven into the forecourt of the theatre. The interior is deserted but a man is quietly making his way towards the office. Halliday and Ward get ready and conceal themselves, and the man stealthily goes to the safe and opens it with a key.
Halliday turns the light on and the man says that he is an assistant manager. Halliday arrests him. The woman waiting in the car outside starts the engine and starts to drive away, and Halliday and Ward and the man come out. The man manages to pull away from them and runs off. The woman derives off in the car, but Halliday jumps on to the bonnet. The woman swerves to try to dislodge him but Halliday smashed the windscreen with a truncheon, and the car crashes; at the same time other police officers catch the man.
Ward drives Halliday home and they rehearse a story to conceal from Mrs Halliday that Halliday was in personal danger."

tt0049944,"['Horror', 'SciFi']","The movie opens with a scene of a small village in the mountains at night. It is the downtown business district of the small town of Mountaincrest (Big Bear, California), lit by street lights and neon signs. A narrator (an uncredited Fred F. Sears) tells us, ""The word lycanthropy is defined as a human being having the power of becoming a wolf, or of having the power of turning another human into a wolf. Some say lycanthropy stems from nothing but myth and superstition. Yet the belief that a human can turn into a wolf has persisted since the Dark Ages to this very day. It is a universal belief. The ancient Romans and Greeks wrote of the phenomenon. There are tales of such happenings in Borneo, Turkey, South America. Everywhere. The American Navajo Indians and other tribes tell stories about wolf-men. The legends have persisted from the beginnings of man's memory of time. Why? Why haven't these tales died? The tales that say wolf-men roam the earth."" A man, Duncan Marsh (Steven Rich) approaches Chad's Place, the local bar and watering hole. He hesitates, then enters the establishment. Titles and credits roll.A woman, Min (Marjorie Stapp), a tall blonde feeds a few coins into a jukebox, then returns to her seat at the bar. Marsh pays for his drink, but Hoxie (George Cisar) the bartender is annoyed that it is a large denomination bill, a twenty. Marsh finishes his drink, ignores his change, and slowly walks over to the fireplace and stares at the roaring fire. Marsh slowly walks to the exit but is reminded by Hoxie he has left his change. A tough looking man, Joe Mitchell (an uncredited Charles Horvath) notices Marsh and his slight build and casual way with money and follows him outside. Joe confronts Marsh and demands his money. He pulls Marsh into an alley and beats him up. An old woman, Ma Everett (an uncredited Jean Harvey), passing by hears and sees the commotion and stops to watch. Growls are heard and the feet of the scuffling men are seen. Marsh is victorious in the exchange, but he has changed physically. While we don't see yet, the woman is horrified by the visage and screams. The patrons and bartender are drawn outside by the woman's screams. She explains what happened to Hoxie. Deputy Sheriff Ben Clovey (Harry Lauter) checks on Joe. Hoxie grimaces and says, ""His throat."" Clovey adds, ""Hoxie, only an animal could do that to a man's throat."" Clovey sends Hank Durgis (Larry J. Blake) to fetch Doctor Jonas Gilcrist.Marsh runs out into the woods, followed by the now well armed Ben Clovey, Hoxie, and Mack Fanning (James Gavin) who follow his footprints. Shoe prints suddenly turn into wolf paw prints. Hoxie gets cold feet and insists any further investigation is the responsibility of the law. Ben sends Hoxie and Mack back to brief the Sheriff, Jack Haines. The two men depart and Clovey remains. Back at the bar, Chad's Place, the patrons discuss events. Mack looks out the window and sees Sheriff Haines and Clovey walking back into town. They exit the bar and notice Clovey has been injured. Sheriff Jack Haines (Don Megowan) tells the patrons, ""I don't want you breathing a word about what happened tonight to anyone. Understand? Nobody."" Jack takes Ben to see Dr. Jonas Gilcrist. Amy Standish (Joyce Holden) answers the door. She is the doctor's niece, and leads the men into a room and starts to tend to Ben's arm wounds. She explains that the man killed earlier, Joe, was dead when they brought him. She gets her uncle. Jack asks Ben about what attacked him. Clovey tries to describe the creature, but admits it was dark and he didn't get a good look at the thing. Dr. Jonas Gilcrist (Ken Christy) enters wearing a bathrobe and complaining about the late hour. The doctor wants information and reminds the sheriff that if he wants to marry his niece he better be more forthcoming. Jonas treats Clovey and leaves the bandaging to Amy. Clovey intimates that it may be a werewolf, but Doc Gilcrist isn't buying, ""Storybook stuff. The things kids get nightmares about."" Sheriff Haines intends to set up roadblocks, ""Nothing's getting in or out of town without us knowing."" Haines kisses Amy goodnight, and he and his deputy leave.The next morning, Marsh wakes up shivering from the cold in a drainage opening. He is in distress and rubs his bare feet. He sees paw prints in the snow and recognizes something familiar, ""I was dreaming! I know I was dreaming!"" He tries to convince himself some animal wandered by and left the tracks. He finds his shoes and socks and puts them back on his feet. Outside the Sheriff's Office, a crowd of men gather to complain about the moratorium on hunting in the woods. The Sheriff checks on the roadblocks. Three reporters are curious about the roadblock and admit that a talkative undertaker in Larken gave them enough information to know a story was worth investigating in Mountaincrest. The Sheriff relents and allows them to come to town. Marsh observes the roadblock from a higher elevation then heads back into the woods. He happens upon Amy outside her home getting firewood from the pile. He tells Amy he came looking for the doctor and asks to see him. Amy leads him into the house. Marsh tells Amy and Jonas he doesn't remember his name, ""I can't remember who I am, or even what I'm doing in this town."" He recalls an automobile accident and seeing two doctors. He asks if a man was killed the night before. When told yes, he asks how and is told it was by an animal. Marsh corrects the doctor and admits he killed Joe. When Amy presents him with a sedative he reacts violently and runs from the house. Amy calls the Sheriff's Office and speaks to Clovey. Jonas and Amy go to the Sheriff's Office and wait for Jack to return. They relay their story to Ben and Jack. Amy tries to dissuade Jack from hunting him down like a criminal because, ""He's not a criminal. He's a sick man."" Jonas and Amy tell the Sheriff he was in an auto accident and he may have brain damage.A man in a lab coat is performing an experiment on a wolf. His name is Dr. Morgan Chambers (George Lynn) and his colleague, Dr. Emery Forrest (S. John Launer) enters the lab carrying a newspaper. Morgan asks, ""You think this is our man?"" Emery replies, ""The paper says they found an animal's teeth marks on the dead man's throat. Morgan, what have you done?"" Morgan, the prototype mad scientist rants about humans destroying themselves with technology. Morgan has a plan to inoculate himself and a few deserving people with his serum and revert to some lower form, but better adapted creature. Morgan knows the side effects of his serum, but is not concerned with Marsh. Morgan tells Emery they must go to Mountaincrest. He casually informs his colleague, ""If the police haven't disposed of the man by the time we get there, it may become our task."" The doorbell rings and Morgan answers. He is distressed to find Mrs. Helen Marsh (Eleanore Tanin). She is inquiring about her husband. Morgan explains that his injuries were slight and he left soon after treatment. She leaves the office and returns to her car. Her son, Chris (Kim Charney) asks about his father. They get in the car and drive home, hoping Marsh will call. Marsh has taken back to the woods, but he has been followed by a large and angry posse. Drs. Forrest and Chambers encounter the roadblock trying to enter Mountaincrest. They identify themselves and indicate they have information that will help the Sheriff. They are allowed to pass. It is getting late and the Sheriff and posse agree to push on for another half mile. Forrest and Chambers are armed and doing their own search. Marsh hears them approaching and hides in the entrance of an old mine. Forrest spotted him and enters the mine. He finds Marsh. Marsh asks for help, but is told nothing can be done. Marsh transforms into a werewolf. Forrest tries to escape, calling for his partner. Forrest is attacked by the werewolf, but a shot by Morgan's rifle scares him off. The Sheriff and his posse arrive, and Haines is very unhappy the interference flushed Marsh from the mine. Dr. Chambers tells the Sheriff that Marsh was a patient of theirs. That night Clovey tells the Sheriff and Amy that Marsh killed a sheep over at the Sanderson Ranch and ate it. Haines, Amy and Jonas meet to discuss the Sheriff's plan, which is to put out bait and use bear traps to catch Marsh.The next morning the Sheriff oversees the preparation of the traps. He returns to the office to talk to the three reporters. The three lawmen exchange information and now know the identity of the man--Duncan Marsh. Mrs. Marsh and son drive to Mountaincrest. Marsh is still in the woods and takes the bait and is caught by the trap. He is able to free himself but is now seriously injured, and transforms back to human form. Forrest and Chambers meet at the bar. Chambers is concerned that now that Marsh's wife is in town the law may try a capture rather than a kill strategy. Chambers wants Marsh dead. Mrs. Marsh and Chris are staying at the home of Jonas and Amy. Mrs. Marsh confronts the Sheriff and is told the facts. She volunteers to join the search and the Sheriff reluctantly agrees.Haines, Clovey, Amy, Mrs. Marsh and Chris begin the search. Helen Marsh tries to get her husband to surrender. Marsh shows himself and his son rushes up to greet him. Helen joins her husband. Amy renders first aid. The posse has gathered at the bar to get drunk and gloat. Duncan Marsh is now in a jail cell at the Sheriff's Office. He meets with his wife and son and implores his family to leave before he changes again. Amy escorts them from the cell. Chambers asks Forrest to find out what precautions the Sheriff is taking to guard Marsh. Jonas Gilcrist, Amy and the Sheriff speculate on Marsh's condition. He notes, ""The thing is, the man who did it to Marsh. What did he have in mind?"" Amy adds, ""And what kind of a future is he dreaming up for everybody else?"" Haines spends the night at the doctor's house.Chambers encounters a very drunk Hank Durgis and persuades him to help him get inside the Sheriff's Office. Forrest knocks Hank out and the two doctors drag their drunk accomplice down to the station. Forrest prepares a sedative of chloroform on a rag for the deputy. When Clovey checks on Hank, the two doctors grab him and administer their sedative. They drag the bodies of both Clovey and Hank back inside the office, then make their way to the cell holding Marsh. Chambers prepares a syringe. They approach the sleeping Marsh, but discover, to their horror and regret, that Marsh isn't sleeping or himself. The werewolf dispatches the two doctors, but not without a lot of screaming, which draws the attention of both the Sheriff and the townsfolk.With two more bodies, the Sheriff is convinced hunting down and killing Marsh is the only solution. He and the posse search the woods. Armed with torches and guns they press on, encouraged by a blood trail to follow. They close in and throw torches at the creature. The fire and gunshots scare the werewolf. The Sheriff and posse decide to leave and return when it's light. The next morning they return in force and begin the pursuit. They spot him heading for the bridge. A Caterpillar Grader is employed to block the bridge. The werewolf climbs over the bridge and up an embankment. He is shot several times and transforms back into human form as he lay dying. We close with a scene on the bridge and an exchange between Haines and Clovey. Clovey exclaims, ""You see that? He changed back again. Do you think he'll stay that way this time?"" Haines replies, ""Yeah, he'll stay. Now he can go home."""
tt0049967,"['Horror', 'SciFi']","While going through some routine practice training in Scotland for mine detection, a group of soldiers detects a large radioactive signal just before the ground opens up in an explosive eruption. They summon plutonium scientist Dr. Adam Royston (Dean Jagger) for advice as to what to do. When Royston's own lab is destroyed, he surmises that the culprit was un-human;
when two soldiers guarding the large crevasse disappear where the ground erupted, he understands that there is some chemical force at work. The Army decides to block up the with concrete, but Royston knows that the force will come out for more radioactive material and prepares for it. When it is revealed by Dr. Royston that the monster is actually a mass of energy, he gets ample resistance from the voice of reason, the Army generals at hand who decide to bomb the thing back to the center of the earth where it came from. In a final showdown with the force taking a horrible new form, Royston and the Army fight for their lives.
=============================================================================
This is a more detailed synopsis.
The movie opens with the credits and title over an open muddy field in Scotland. A soldier, in a radiation suit, holds a Geiger counter and walks searching for a buried sample. This is a military training exercise. The soldier, ""Spider"" Webb (Anthony Newley), finds the cylinder in a bit over a minute. As the soldiers are about to pack things in for the day, Lancing (Kenneth Cope) asks for a turn. As Sgt. Grimsdyke (Michael Ripper) buries the sample, buddy soldiers Haggis (Ian MacNaughton) and Webb gripe about the cold, the food and the delay. Lancing begins his search. Webb tries to help, but Landing has picked up a stronger radioactive source. Lt. Bannerman (Peter Hammond) takes the counter and tells Sgt. Grimsdyke to fetch Major Cartright. Major Cartright (John Harvey) pulls up in his Jeep and is escorted to the site of the strong radioactive reading. Lancing marks the location with a stick. Grimsdyke, Bannerman, and Cartright walk over to where the sample was buried. Lancing notices the water starting to bubble where he placed the stick. The ground begins to open and the surface water disappears. The other soldiers walk over to Lancing but are ordered back, yet Lancing, fascinated, remains behind. The Sergeant orders a soldier (Edwin Richfield) to fetch him, but the earth splits open, a fireball shoots up, and Lancing falls to the ground.
In nearby Lochmouth, Scotland, an Atomic Energy Facility is processing nuclear materials - Cobalt. A Public Address announcement is made for Dr. Adam Royston. The director's son, Peter Elliott (William Lucas), is substituting for Dr. Royston, working on cobalt sample readings while Royston is down in his workshop some distance from the facility. The director, John Elliott (Edward Chapman) comes looking for Royston in person when Royston fails to respond to pages. Father and son have a philosophical difference as to the son's role at the facility.
Dr. Adam Royston (Dean Jagger) tunes in a classical radio station behind a shield. He's conducting an experiment, using radio waves to rapidly counteract radioactive decay in certain chemical elements. Static on the radio indicates the chemical element is highly radioactive. A guard, Russell (Neil Wilson), comes to collect Royston. Royston walks back to the facility. The director makes it clear Royston is only to work on his assigned tasks and not his own pet projects. He also reiterates that his son is to concentrate on administrative duties, not play scientist. He tells Royston the Army contacted them about ""a radiation reaction."" He sends Royston to check it out, much to Royston's annoyance.
Royston drives down to the War Department test site and takes Geiger readings. They are all negative. He tells the Major he wants to see the injured soldiers. Lancing is the most seriously burned. Royston immediately recognizes the type of burn. Next he examines the other soldier. His back is seriously blistered and the skin is peeling away. The unburned area corresponds to his rifle slung over his shoulder. These are radiation burns (yet without residual radiation).
That night the Army returns with equipment Royston requested, including lights. Lancing has since died of his wounds. Royston requests the presence of the Major. He tells the Major, ""There's nothing more we can do out here. I suggest you leave a couple of men on guard."" Royston and Peter drive back to the atomic facility and discuss the clues.
Two boys out for the evening are planning a little frolic. One dares the other to go to an old keep or tower and see ""Old Tom."" Willie Harding (Michael Brooke) sets off for the tower. He slowly and furtively creeps through the underbrush. He spots the tower and approaches but then sees something. His eyes widen in horror and he backs away, then runs back to his friend, Ian Osborn (Frazer Hines).
Willie was severely burned and is now in hospital. Royston, called in by Dr. Kelly (Robert Bruce) to examine the suspected radiation burns, confirms the diagnosis. Kelly and Royston talk to the parents, asking Jack Harding (Jameson Clark) and his wife Vi (Jane Aird) of the boy's circumstances. They direct Royston to talk to their boy's friend, Ian. Royston stops at the church after services to question Ian. Ian is reluctant at first to discuss their little adventure, but finally tells him exactly where it happened. Royston drives out to the tower. An old moonshiner occupies the place. Royston brings his Geiger counter. He notices a soot-like substance on the floor and a liquid dripping through the ceiling. He finds a still and Old Tom (Norman Macowan) sleeping. Royston spots a radioactive sample bottle on the shelf. It is from his workshop. He tests it and discovers it is now inexplicably inert.
Back at Royston's lab the place shows signs of burglary. Glass is broken and equipment is damaged with a strange soot-like substance everywhere. Peter arrives to find Royston going through the damage. Royston explains the container contains tritium with a half-life of 28 years, but the sample is now inert.
Inspector McGill (Leo McKern) meets with the director, John Elliott. Because a crime involves radiation, McGill is required to investigate. He meets with Royston in the cafeteria. McGill asks about the child who was burned. He already talked to Old Tom and confirmed the child never touched the container. McGill asks Royston to help him investigate.
Willie Harding dies shortly after admission to hospital. Dr. Kelly pronounces and consoles the parents. Royston and McGill arrive, and as they talk to Dr. Kelly, Jack Harding confronts Royston. He tells him, ""You meddle with things that kill, like they killed my boy in there. You should be locked up. You're not safe, you're a murderer.""
A lab technician, Harry Unwin (Neil Hallett) exits the radiation treatment room and calls an obliging nurse for a little assignation, noticing static on the phone line. Willie's body is removed from his room. The nurse, Zena (Marianne Brauns), arrives, and the two retreat into the radiation treatment room where they kiss. Equipment in an inner room starts up on its own. Harry enters alone to investigate, hears a strong static sound, spots something on the floor, and retreats, cowering against the wall. Zena, safe in the outer room, sees it through the glass shielding and screams as the fingers on Harry's hand swell and blister and his face melts away like hot wax, revealing his teeth.
The hospital director (Max Brimmell) shows Royston and McGill the lab. The storage vault is melted and covered in the same soot-like substance. ""Obviously the radium was the target"" reasons Royston, and concludes that the intruder can assume any shape, passing under a door or through a ventilation grill. McGill tells Royston that the Major posted soldiers at the origin point - the fissure.
At the fissure, Haggis and Webb stand guard. Haggis hears something, sees a glow out by the fissure, and ventures to have a look. From the dark, he calls to Webb, then screams. Webb heads out to aid his friend and finds only his discarded rifle, covered with soot. He hears the buzzing / static sound and turns, fires his machine gun at it, screams, falls down, and is never heard nor seen again. Shortly thereafter, Royston, McGill, and the Major drive up <to discover the site unmanned. The major finds a torn cap.
At the atomic facility, Royston calls a meeting to brainstorm. He proposes that the creature lives underground and is intelligent. About every fifty years, a particular planetary alignment exerts a greater pull on the Earth and the creature beaks out. To live it needs energy. Fifty years ago there was nothing on the surface to eat, but now there is - radiation, with radioactive isotopes in Royston's lab and at the hospital. The director is not convinced and calls the hypothesis ""absolute rubbish."" McGill wants to see the thing at the fissure.
With arrangements and equipment provided by the military, Peter volunteers to go down into the fissure. On a ledge he discovers the uniform and skeletal remains of one of the soldiers. He continues down, but now his Geiger reacts. He sees ""it"" and demands to be pulled out fast. They get him to the car and McGill asks, ""Peter, what did you see down there?"" Peter breathlessly replies, ""I don't know what it was. It is something out of a nightmare. It was horrible."" The Major tells Royston his orders: kill the thing then concrete over the fissure. They employ napalm then detonate explosives and cover it in concrete.
Royston is back in his lab working. McGill stops in for a chat and tells him what the Army did. Royston is dubious that that will stop the thing. He asks, ""How do you kill mud?"" McGill, under orders, is leaving for London. Royston tells McGill of his pet project, namely, the ability to disintegrate atomic structure without the explosion. McGill leaves, parting as friends.
At the fissure, the concrete cap explodes and a mud-like creature flows out. The atomic pile at the facility is now inactive. They are removing the cobalt to be transported elsewhere. McGill calls headquarters and requests a delay in his return to London. The phone line is bad and he has trouble hearing his boss. As he leaves he hears a police report about ""people melting."" He stops cold, takes the report and rushes to the scene. A car is burned and has the same soot-like substance on it. McGill calls Royston at the facility and tells him four people were melted. Royston, the director, and Peter go to the director's office to consult a map of the area. Royston tells John and Peter the thing senses radiation and moves in a straight line. After noting the first two incidents on the chart, Royston plots a third line from the fissure to where they are - the Atomic Energy Establishment. ""It's on its way for the biggest meal of its life."" McGill arrives at the facility as the cobalt is loaded onto a truck. The creature arrives at one of the guard posts and, before the affected guard melts, an alarm is sounded. The creature rolls over a building and absorbs the cobalt. They suggest clearing its path when it returns to the fissure. McGill explains to the director they need to take action tonight. The next target is an even larger nuclear facility, and to get there it must pass through Inverness.
Royston and Peter are in his workshop working on his experiment. The Director and McGill arrive to see another test. As a new sample is bombarded with radio waves, the Geiger counter shows less and less radioactivity until it shows zero, but the container starts to glow, then it explodes. Royston is concerned it won't work, but everything they need is at the fissure to scale up this experiment and try it on the creature.
Royston proposes to use a radioactive ""bait"" on a Jeep to lure the creature out of the fissure and between the radio transmitters. He coordinates synchronizing the transmitters. He calls for the Jeep to go to the fissure, but the driver has trouble keeping the vehicle running. He is sick, so Peter takes over. Against orders, he pulls the Jeep closer to the fissure to lure it out. It chases the Jeep between the radio transmitters and begins to glow and writhe. It explodes into flames and disappears. Royston calls for Geiger counters for a reading. They approach the fissure to an even larger explosion that knocks everyone off their feet. We close with Royston walking up to and peering into the fissure."
tt0050083,"['Crime', 'Drama']","In a New York City courthouse, an eighteen-year-old boy from a slum is on trial for allegedly stabbing his father to death. Final closing arguments having been presented, a visibly bored judge instructs the jury to decide whether the boy is guilty of murder. If there is any reasonable doubt of his guilt they are to return a verdict of not guilty. The judge further informs them that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence.The jury retires to a private room, where the jurors spend a short while getting acquainted before they begin deliberating. It is immediately apparent that the jurors have already decided that the boy is guilty, and that they plan to return their verdict without taking time for discussion with the sole exception of Juror 8 (Henry Fonda), who is the only ""not guilty"" vote in a preliminary tally. He explains that there is too much at stake for him to go along with the verdict without at least talking about it first. His vote annoys the other jurors, especially Juror 7 (Jack Warden), who has tickets to a baseball game that evening; and Juror 10 (Ed Begley Sr.), who believes that people from slum backgrounds are liars, wild, and dangerous.The rest of the film's focus is the jury's difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict. While several of the jurors harbor personal prejudices, Juror 8 maintains that the evidence presented in the case is circumstantial, and that the boy deserves a fair deliberation. He calls into question the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the ""rarity"" of the murder weapon (a common switchblade, of which he has an identical copy), and the overall questionable circumstances. He further argues that he cannot in good conscience vote ""guilty"" when he feels there is reasonable doubt of the boy's guilt.Having argued several points and gotten no favorable response from the others, Juror 8 reluctantly agrees that he has only succeeded in hanging the jury. Instead, he requests another vote, this time by secret ballot. He proposes that he will abstain from voting, and if the other 11 jurors are still unanimous in a guilty vote, then he will acquiesce to their decision. The secret ballot is held, and a new ""not guilty"" vote appears. This earns intense criticism from Juror 3 (Lee J. Cobb), who blatantly accuses Juror 5 (Jack Klugman) who had grown up in a slum of switching out of sympathy toward slum children. However, Juror 9 (Joseph Sweeney) reveals that he himself changed his vote, feeling that Juror 8's points deserve further discussion.Juror 8 presents a convincing argument that one of the witnesses, an elderly man who claimed to have heard the boy yell ""I'm going to kill you"" shortly before the murder took place, could not have heard the voices as clearly as he had testified due to an elevated train passing by at the time; as well as stating that ""I'm going to kill you,"" is often said by people who do not literally mean it. Juror 5 changes his vote to ""not guilty"". Soon afterward, Juror 11 (George Voskovec) questions whether it is reasonable to suppose the defendant would have fled the scene, having cleaned the knife of fingerprints but leaving it behind, and then come back three hours later to retrieve it (having been left in his father's chest). Juror 11 then changes his vote.Juror 8 then mentions the man's second claim: upon hearing the father's body hit the floor, he had run to the door of his apartment and seen the defendant running out of the building from his front door in 15 seconds. Jurors 5, 6 and 8 question whether this is true, as the witness in question had had a stroke, limiting his ability to walk. Upon the end of an experiment, the jury finds that the witness would not have made it to the door in enough time to actually see the killer running out. Juror 8 concludes that, judging from what he claims to have heard earlier, the witness must have merely assumed it was the defendant running. Juror 3, growing more irritated throughout the process, explodes in a rant: ""He's got to burn! He's slipping through our fingers!"" Juror 8 takes him to task, calling him a ""self-appointed public avenger"" and a sadist, saying he wants the defendant to die because of personal desire rather than the facts. Juror 3 shouts ""I'll kill him!"" and starts lunging at Juror 8, but is restrained by Jurors 5 and 7. Juror 8 calmly retorts, ""You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?"", proving his previous point.Jurors 2 (John Fiedler) and 6 (Edward Binns) also decide to vote ""not guilty"", tying the vote at 6-6. Soon after, a rainstorm hits the city, apparently postponing the baseball game for which Juror 7 has tickets, thus allowing him to relax and pay attention with that schedule pressure relieved.Juror 4 (E.G. Marshall) continues to state that he does not believe the boy's alibi, which was being at the movies with a few friends at the time of the murder, because the boy could not remember what movie he had seen when questioned by police shortly after the murder. Juror 8 explains that being under emotional stress can make you forget certain things, and tests how well Juror 4 can remember the events of previous days. Juror 4 remembers, with some difficulty, the events of the previous five days, and Juror 8 points out that he had not been under emotional stress at that time, thus there was no reason to think the boy should be able to remember the particulars of the movie that he claimed to have seen.Juror 2 calls into question the prosecution's claim that the accused, who was 5'7"" tall, was able to inflict the downward stab wound found on his father, who was 6'2"". Jurors 3 and 8 conduct an experiment to see if it's possible for a shorter person to stab downward into a taller person. The experiment proves the possibility, but Juror 5 then explains that he had grown up amidst knife fights in his neighborhood, and shows, through demonstrating the correct use of a switchblade, that no one so much shorter than his opponent would have held a switchblade in such a way as to stab downward, as the grip would have been too awkward and the act of changing hands too time-consuming. Rather, someone that much shorter than his opponent would stab underhanded at an upwards angle. This revelation augments the certainty of several of the jurors in their belief that the defendant is not guilty.Increasingly impatient, Juror 7 changes his vote just so that the deliberation may end, which earns him the ire of Jurors 3 and 11, both on opposite sides of the discussion. Juror 11, an immigrant who has repeatedly displayed strong patriotic pride, presses Juror 7 hard about using his vote frivolously, and eventually Juror 7 admits that he now truly believes the defendant is not guilty.The next jurors to change their votes are Jurors 12 (Robert Webber) and the Jury Foreman (Martin Balsam), making the vote 9-3 and leaving only three dissenters: Jurors 3, 4 and 10. Outraged at how the proceedings have gone, Juror 10 goes into a rage on why people from the slums cannot be trusted, of how they are little better than animals who gleefully kill each other off for fun. His speech offends Juror 5, who turns his back to him, and one by one the rest of the jurors start turning away from him. Confused and disturbed by this reaction to his diatribe, Juror 10 continues in a steadily fading voice and manner, slowing to a stop with ""Listen to me. Listen..."" Juror 4, the only man still facing him, tersely responds, ""I have. Now sit down and don't open your mouth again."" As Juror 10 moves to sit in a corner by himself, Juror 8 speaks quietly about the evils of prejudice, and the other jurors slowly resume their seats.When those remaining in favor of a guilty vote are pressed as to why they still maintain that there is no reasonable doubt, Juror 4 states his belief that despite all the other evidence that has been called into question, the fact remains that the woman who saw the murder from her bedroom window across the street (through the passing train) still stands as solid evidence. After he points this out, Juror 12 changes his vote back to ""guilty"", making the vote 8-4.Then Juror 9, after seeing Juror 4 rub his nose (which is being irritated by his eye glasses), realizes that, like Juror 4, the woman who allegedly saw the murder had impressions in the sides of her nose which she rubbed, indicating that she wore glasses, but did not wear them to court out of vanity. Juror 8 cannily asks Juror 4 if he wears his eyeglasses to sleep, and Juror 4 admits that he does not wear them nobody does. Juror 8 explains that there was thus no logical reason to expect that the witness happened to be wearing her glasses while trying to sleep, and he points out that on her own evidence the attack happened so swiftly that she would not have had time to put them on. After he points this out, Jurors 12, 10 and 4 all change their vote to ""not guilty"".At this point, the only remaining juror with a guilty vote is Juror 3. Juror 3 gives a long and increasingly tortured string of arguments, ending with, ""Rotten kids, you work your life out!"" This builds on a more emotionally ambivalent earlier revelation that his relationship with his own son is deeply strained, and his anger over this fact is the main reason that he wants the defendant to be guilty. Juror 3 finally loses his temper and tears up a photo of himself and his son, then suddenly breaks down crying and changes his vote to ""not guilty"", making the vote unanimous.As the jurors leave the room, Juror 8 helps the distraught Juror 3 with his coat in a show of compassion. The film ends when the friendly Jurors 8 (Mr. Davis) and 9 (Mr. McCardle) exchange names, and all of the jurors descend the courthouse steps to return to their individual lives... never to see each other again.(Note: there is no indication nor is the question ever answered if the teenage boy really is guilty or not; instead the film makes it clear that this is outside of the question if the jurors cannot be certain that he is guilty, if there is any reasonable doubt, they must acquit him.)"

A spaceship breaks through the cloud cover and crashes into the sea nearby. At first the fisherman leave the area, but one of the crew worries there might be people trapped inside and insists on going back to investigateGetting close to the wreck, they find a gash in the hull and decide enter and search for survivors. Working their way to the control room they find two men alive but badly injured. Both men are evacuated before a series of explosions rock the vessel and it sinks.Later in Washington in the office of Major General McIntosh (Thomas Henry) discusses the crash. They are unaware of the survivors and assume the craft has been lost with all hands. A report comes in identifying the crash location in Sicily. McIntosh and Doctor Uhl (John Zaremba) make arrangements to travel to Sicily and examine the the crash site.Back at the village Commissar Charra (Tito Vuolo) collects information from the fishermen about what they saw inside the ship. Although the men only saw three crewmen, everyone is convinced the crew had to be bigger given the huge size of the ship.One of the children, Pepe (Bart Braverman) finds a canister on the beach and is in the middle of burying it when he is summoned to answer questions about a visiting American doctor visiting the area. The local village doctor is away delivering twins and no one knows when he will be back. The boy is instructed to fetch the American doctor in hope he can care for the injured astronauts.Before fetching the doctor Pepe returns to the canister and removes a gelatinous mass, which he wraps in a blanket. Pepe finds Doctor Leonardo (Frank Puglia) but is disappointed to learn he is not a real doctor but a zoologist. Leonardo suggests his granddaughter Marisa (Joan Taylor) who is medical student traveling with him may be able to help.Doctor Leonardo has been paying Pepe to recover shellfish for his studies. Pepe shows him the contents of the canister after bartering how much he will pay for it. Intrigued Leonardo begins examining the mass, he is convinced he can see a shape buried inside.At the village hospital Marisa makes the men as comfortable as possible. Col Robert Calder (William Hopper) the commander of the flight regains consciousness and immediately shows grave concerns for the other survivor Dr Sharman (Arthur Space) The Captain presses Sharman for information about how long the creature in the canister could survive, before he can say too much he dies, becoming the 9th victim of the flight.Back at Leonardos caravan, a creature only a few inches tall hatch from the gelatinous mass. Dr Leonardo is fascinated at the anatomy of the beast and moves it to a cage for further examination. The doctor and his daughter, returned from the hospital, decide to leave the creature in the cage overnightNext morning Leonardo examines the cage and finds the creature is well over 2 feet tall. He decides he needs to talk to the Pepe and find out exactly where the creature was found.Later that day a US seaplane arrives with McIntosh and Uhl. They go to meet Col Calder and have a conference. A representative of the Italian government Commissario Charra (Tito Vuolo) arrives and is briefed on events. McIntosh explains a biological specimen is missing and it is an unborn animal from Venus.Charra offers a diving team to go down and inspect the wreck and locate the specimen. McIntosh goes on to interview the fishermen. The General describes the missing canister,although afraid, Pepe admits he found the cylinder and that he sold the specimen to Doctor Leonardo. The General sends Calder after Leonardo who is now on route to Rome.Leonardo stops on the side of the road to refasten one of the ropes on the cage. The creature sees its opportunity and breaks free escapes. Leonardo is checking on Maria who was injured by the creature when Calder arrives. After having the situation explained to him he sets of to track the creature through the surrounding farmlandsThe creature stumbles into barn where it becomes confused and agitated by the various animals it encountersfused and tentative about the various animals it encounters. Moving to a storage area it finds a bag of sulfur and begins to consume the contents till attacked by a dog. Drawn by the noise of the two animals fighting the farm owner arrives and tries to shoot the creatureCalder also drawn by the noise stops the farmer, telling him the priority is to capture the creature alive. The attempt at capture fails and the farmer is attacked. Desperate Calder opens fire with his own gun. Although struck several times the creature seems to retreat back into the barn uninjured. Calder breaks off his own attack and locks the creature in the barnDuring the night the creature escapes. From reviewing Dr Sharmans notes it is understood the animal lives on sulfur and is probably heading for deposits of the mineral around Mount Etna. Charra then informs Calder that the Italian government will allow no further attempts to capture the creature. After the attack on the farmer the animal is far too dangerous.Calder strikes a deal that if he tracks and locates the creature first he can try and capture it before Charras forces arrive to destroy it. Calders plan is to use two helicopters, one loaded with Sulfur to tempt the animal and the craft has a net to be dropped once the creature becomes distracted.Charras forces find the animal first, and although they drive it back towards a waterfall they dont have the firepower to defeat it. Unaware of Charras efforts, Calders group approaches, drops the sulfur then the net. As the animal struggles to release itself a mild electric shock is run through the net paralyzing the creature instantly.Later at the US embassy in Rome, the General briefs the press on events, and allows a limited number of press representatives to visit the zoo where the creature is being held. The creature is chained down and kept unconscious with a continuous electrical current while various tests are performed.Calder introduces the press to the scientists working on the creature. So far little beyond the creatures amazing sense of smell is known. Calder sees Marisa working with her father, after finding a quiet corner it is obvious romantic attraction is building, with even an agreement for a date after the research on the monster is complete.During an experiment a chain snaps and the equipment producing the paralyzing electrical current is destroyed. The monster quickly revives and breaks free of its bonds, and the building housing it. Still disorientated the creature encounters an elephant that immediately reacts by charging.Patrons at the zoo panic as the battle between the elephant and the creature continues. Calder contacts McIntosh and explains the situation; he immediately authorizes the use of tanks and artillery to destroy it. Meanwhile the creature fatally wounds the elephant and flees into the city.Calder briefly spots the creature before it disappears into the Tiber River, Calder transmits this information to McIntosh who orders the river shelled in hopes of bringing the beast to the surface. The tactic works and the creature emerges destroying a bridge before heading towards the coliseum for a final confrontation with troops patrolling there.The creature arrives and is attacked by infantry supported by a flame throwing tank. Calder and the general arrive to take charge of the situation. More troops pour into the area but creature has disappeared among the ruins.The soldiers re-establish contact with the creature. Trying to escape it climbs higher till finally cornered in the upper reaches of the ruins. A barrage of bazooker and tank fire seem to wound the creature before a miss directed shell hits the ruins causing the creature to fall to its death"
tt0050086,"['Drama', 'Thriller', 'Western']","A stagecoach makes its way across the scorched desert as we hear Frankie Laine sing the theme song that will be repeated in many guises throughout the film (even whistled by the villain). It's the Arizona Territory of the 1880s. The stagecoach is going from Contention City to Bisbee and is only a few miles from its destination. A group of men on horseback herd cattle to block the path of the stage. After it stops and the dust clears, we see that the men are a band of thieves, some with their guns drawn. The owner of the stage line, Mr. Butterfield (Robert Emhardt), is on board, and the target of the robbery is a gold shipment atop the stage. Small-time rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin) and his two young sons, Mark (Jerry Hartleben) and Mathew (Barry Curtis), are on horseback looking for their errant cattle. Dan hears the cattle over the ridge, and they ride over to where they can see the robbery in progress. Dan waits for the dust to settle, but the robbers spot him, and their leader, Ben Wade (Glenn Ford), tells him to stay where he is--he'll get his cattle back in five minutes.As one of the robbers passes down the gold, the driver, Bill Moons (Boyd Stockman), draws his own gun and grabs the man as a shield. The gang leader draws and fires off two shots--one that kills his own man to clear the line of sight and one that kills Bill Moons. Mark asks his father if he isn't going to do something, but Dan sees there's nothing he can do without getting himself shot. He recognizes the robbers as Ben Wade and his gang. Wade has words with Mr. Butterfield and instructs him to return the driver's body to Contention City where he lived. ""Where a man lives, that's where he should be buried."" Wade then confiscates Dan's horses so he won't ride to the marshal. He says he'll turn them loose just this side of Bisbee. Taking the six horses from the stagecoach as well, Wade and his men depart. Dan and his boys go on foot to bring the cattle home, and Dan agrees to return with a horse for the stranded stage.At home, Dan's devoted wife Alice (Leora Dana) is shocked at her husband's lack of outrage over the crime. He explains there were twelve of them and there was nothing he could do. People have to watch a lot of terrible things: ""You just seem to expect somethin' from me that I'm not."" Dan is defeated and distracted by the three-year drought that threatens his ranch. He has cattle dying of thirst, and he doesn't have the $200 a neighboring rancher charges for six months' water right to a stream that runs through his land--one that doesn't run dry. Alice urges Dan to borrow the money in town, and he concedes, ""I suppose I could try.""At the saloon in Bisbee, Wade and his men, posing as cowhands, tell the pretty barmaid, Emmy (Felicia Farr), that they just witnessed the stage being robbed and its driver killed. The marshal (Ford Rainey) organizes a posse to ride out after the outlaws. Wade tells his men to scatter into the countryside, cross the border and meet that night in Nogales. His men ride out in one direction, and the posse rides out in the opposite direction, while Wade remains behind to romance Emmy.Dan and Butterfield see the spot along the trail where the gang buried their man. The posse rides up, and Butterfield tells them the perpetrators went into Bisbee. Dan describes them and identifies them as Ben Wade and his gang. The marshal realizes he was duped. Alex Potter (Henry Jones), the town drunk, catches up and reveals that one of the gang is still back at the saloon. Surmising it must be Wade himself, they all ride back to town to capture him.Dan approaches Wade in the saloon about being paid for the half a day's time he lost finding his cattle and bringing them home. Wade pays him two dollars for his time (the rate for a full day's work) and even adds two more for the boys' time: ""I used their time too, didn't I?"" Dan says it was tiring for the cattle, and Wade pays him two more for tired cattle. As Dan asks about two dollars extra ""for makin' me nervous,"" the marshal sneaks up behind Wade and arrests him. Witnessing the arrest is Wade's main henchman, Charlie Prince (Richard Jaeckel), who doubled back to check on the boss. He rides out to notify the others. Aware that the outlaws will return to free their leader, the marshal wants to get Wade out of town quickly.The marshal tries to deputize Dan--""you're the best shot we got ... every man here is a deputy""--but Dan declines. He came into town on business, and he has dying cattle to take care of. Dan asks Mac (George Mitchell), posse member, proprietor of the saloon and small-time banker, for a $200 loan. Mac can't help him but asks about the missus and the boys. Outside, the marshal asks for two volunteers to ride ahead with Dave Keene (Bill Hale). The marshal won't reveal the exact nature and risk of the assignment, and the others are also reluctant--they don't know if it'll be safe. He answers their concern: ""Who knows what's safe? I know a man dropped dead from lookin' at his wife. My own grandmother fought the Indians for 60 years and then choked to death on lemon pie."" Butterfield offers $200 to each man, and Dan, just arriving from the saloon, jumps at the opportunity. The marshal gives him a sawed-off, double-barreled shotgun to use. The only other taker is the inept Alex. The rest will follow with the prisoner in the coach. Dave Keene tells Dan: ""Here's the plan. We're gonna transfer him at your house. ... It'll only take a minute.""Butterfield's rescued stagecoach arrives, drawn by two replacement horses. Butterfield tells the passengers they'll have to stay the night, and Bill Moons's body is removed for shipment back to Contention City on another coach that evening. Two more horses are hitched up to make a ""four-up""--this coach has been reserved for the first leg of Wade's journey. From a hill overlooking the trail, Charlie Prince and one of his cohorts watch the coach's progress. In a staged deception, the driver runs the right rear wheel off the edge of a small bridge into a ditch. The men with the coach struggle to free it. The marshal makes a show of enlisting help from the nearby ranch house (Dan's), thereby removing Wade and replacing him with imposter Dave Keene. The outlaws on the hill apparently fall for the ruse.Wade is then held at Dan's ranch. Alice serves a fine supper to the family and their ""guest,"" and Dan thinks she shows a little too much interest in the prisoner's conversation--""all big-eyed and listenin' to him."" Dan explains the rest of the plan to her. The two outlaws who were tricked by the transfer will have to round up their men first before catching up with the coach and discovering that their leader is not on it. By then it should be at least noon of the following day, and they won't have enough time to reach Contention City before the train to Yuma comes through. Meanwhile, Dan and Alex will escort Wade to Contention City and wait there to put him on the 3:10 to Yuma--out of his gang's reach. (The territorial prison is in Yuma.)After supper, Dan and Alex escort Wade under cover of darkness to Contention City, where they arrive at daybreak. Butterfield meets them at the edge of town by the train station. He says the plan to stay in a house by the station has changed--the owner's afraid--and all he could arrange was a room at the hotel. There's a drunk sleeping it off under a newspaper in the hotel lobby. Alex goes to keep watch at the edge of town while Dan guards Wade in the bridal suite upstairs in the front. Dan threatens to shoot if Wade tries to escape, but when Wade tries to jump him, Dan spares his life. Butterfield reads the Contention City Weekly in the lobby, getting up to ask the desk clerk (Guy Wilkerson)--also the hotel's bartender and proprietor--about the sleeping man: ""Sure is some sleeper.""The clock strikes eleven. Wade offers Dan $400 to let him escape--double what Butterfield is paying. An approaching drumbeat is heard. Out the window, they see Moons's funeral procession pass in the street below, prompting Wade to assert that he shot the driver in self-defense. The driver drew first, he says, conveniently leaving out that it was during the armed robbery already in progress.The man sleeping under the newspaper in the lobby wakes up--it's Charlie Prince. He sees the time (11:07), asks if any strangers have come into town (""not since you went to sleep, sir""), and goes outside. Wade offers to be Dan's silent partner with money--$7,000. The funeral procession returns and breaks up outside the hotel. The men enter for drinks. Moons's brother Bob (Sheridan Comerate) sees Butterfield and denounces him for not attending the funeral, throwing a drink in his face. Wade increases his offer to $10,000. There's a knock, and Butterfield says he's got a pot of coffee. Dan unlocks the door, and Bob barges in with his gun drawn. Butterfield explains: ""I couldn't help it. He found out and pulled a gun. He's been drinking."" Bent on revenge, Bob threatens to kill Wade--and Dan too if he tries to stop him. Dan protects Wade, but in the ensuing scuffle Bob's gun goes off, alerting Charlie Prince in the street below (on his horse now). Dan confiscates Bob's revolver. Butterfield asks, ""What if somebody heard that shot?"" Dan sees Charlie looking up from below and backs away from the window, but Wade and Charlie see each other and exchange smiles. Charlie gallops off to get the others; Alex sees him go.Wade claims the same thing would have happened in Benson or Huachuca--his men are in all the places they might have taken him. ""We send one man ahead to each of those places--to wait, and watch."" Wade wonders aloud if Bob will stay to help Dan put him on the train. He predicts that Butterfield will not, but Butterfield gives Dan his word: ""I'll walk with you every step of the way to that station."" Alex calls up that he saw a fellow ride out fast. Butterfield says they know and tells him to go back and keep watching. Dan tells Butterfield to get the sheriff and have him get as many deputies as he can, but Bob tells them the sheriff is out of town--he took a prisoner to Tucson. Bob refuses to get involved and bails out. (Wade's got a big, tough outfit--it's not a fair fight. He has to think of his mother--she just buried one son.) Butterfield goes to look for any five men to help.At 2:30 Butterfield returns and says he has five men in the lobby for a total of eight. Dan says not to let them start anything unless the outlaws come into the hotel. Wade rattles Dan by rambling on about Dan's wife: ""I'd treat her a whole lot better than you do. ... I wouldn't make her work so hard. ... I bet she was a real beautiful girl before she met you.""The gang rides into town at a full gallop. The five recruits are having drinks at the bar in the hotel lobby. Alex calls up from the street that they're coming and goes inside to help Butterfield and the recruits, who take cover behind the furnishings. When the riders reach the hotel, Wade asks Dan, ""When shall I tell 'em you're gonna let me go?"" Dan replies testily, ""Tell them you'll write 'em a letter every day from Yuma."" Wade calls down from the window: ""Charlie, go buy the boys a drink. We'll be down soon."" The outlaws spread out. Wade makes another pitch for Dan to let him go. Dan considers it for a moment: ""Are you sure that no one would ever know?"" But when Wade asks him why he's squeezing the watch--it ""ain't gonna stop time""--Dan throws it across the room in a rage.The recruits counted seven riders. They didn't figure on a big shootout, and they disperse. Butterfield follows them into the street and offers them $50 each to stay, to no avail. The hotelier also retreats. Wade tells Dan again that Butterfield will walk out on him in the end: ""He's gonna leave you all alone. Now what do you figure you're gonna die for, huh? Because Butterfield lost his gold shipment? Or because some fool driver got what he deserved?""Butterfield tells Alex he's going up to talk to Dan and tells him to watch from the street in front of the hotel. When Alex sees a sniper on the roof opposite, he draws his gun, but Charlie sneaks up from behind and forces him to drop it. Alex shouts, ""Dan, the roof!"" The sniper shoots twice at Dan in the hotel window but misses. Dan fires the revolver once with precision, and the sniper falls into the street below. Charlie shoots Alex in the back, and his partners drag Alex inside. Butterfield enters Dan's room (207), and Dan hears Alex cry out to him in his death throes. Dan says if there's one more shot he'll shoot Wade. Wade calls down, ""Hey Charlie, you've got one more shot; make it good."" Charlie replies, ""Tell 'em we'll use it on the way to the station."" Dan tells Butterfield to go see what they did to Alex. Butterfield steps out of the room and sees Alex's body hanging from the lobby chandelier. Panicked, he returns and releases Dan from his obligation.A thunderclap is heard as Alice drives her carriage up to the hotel. She enters, passes Alex's hanging corpse, and climbs the stairs. Dan hands off the shotgun to Butterfield and goes out to meet her. She runs to his arms and urges him not to be stubborn. She assures him she loves every minute of her life with him, even if it's a hard life. Butterfield says he'll pay the $200 anyway. Alice implores Dan not to go through with it: ""I don't want a hero; I want you."" But Dan is committed: ""I've got to, that's all. ... If I didn't have to do it, I wouldn't. But I heard Alex scream. The town drunk gave his life because he believed that people should be able to live in decency and peace together. You think I can do less?""The clock strikes three. As they go down the stairs, Dan asks Butterfield to stay behind with Alice and drive her out of town as fast as he can once they get near the cattle pens. He tells Alice not to worry: ""As soon as I get him to Yuma, I'll be right back."" He escorts Wade out the back door, and we hear another thunderclap, then a third. Another sniper on the roof fires and misses. ""Tell him one more shot and I'll cut you in two,"" Dan reiterates. Wade calls: ""I told you you had just one more shot. Next time you better make it good.""The train whistle blows--right on time. Cattle come by, and Dan uses them as cover to cross the street. The gang members mount their horses and dash to the station. The train arrives. Dan unhitches a horse and uses it as cover to walk across the last open stretch to the station. The whistle blows again and spooks the horse--they run the rest of the way. The train starts to pull out, and Dan walks Wade to the moving train under cover of the steam shooting from the side of the locomotive. The gang emerges on the other side of the billowing steam--six of them. Charlie shouts for Wade to drop down to allow him a clear shot at Dan, but Wade doesn't do it. He unexpectedly complies with Dan's order to jump into the passing baggage car, the last car before the caboose, and they make the jump together. Wade: ""Let's us get outta here."" Dan: ""Us? How do I know you'll jump?"" Wade: ""You'll have to trust me on this one. Jump!"" The others run alongside after them, and Charlie shoots at Dan but misses. Dan shoots back twice with the revolver, hitting Charlie, who falls to the stony ground.Then Wade explains that he doesn't like owing anybody any favors, and Dan saved his life back at the hotel. ""It's all right,"" he says, ""I've broken out of Yuma before."" Dan replies, ""My job's finished when I get you there."" The train passes Alice outside of town, where she's waiting in her carriage with Butterfield standing alongside. Dan waves to her and it begins to rain. Alice and Butterfield wave back through the deluge as we hear Frankie Laine sing a third and final verse of the theme song."
tt0050095,"['Adventure', 'Horror']","Titles and credits run over wide shots of the Himalayas. We open with a party on horseback approaching a Buddhist temple. Inside the courtyard some monks work as others chant in prayer. The majordomo (Anthony Chinn) announces himself and enters the Lhama's (Arnold Marle) chamber with refreshments. Dr. John Rollason (Peter Cushing) and his assistant, Peter Fox (Richard Wattis) examine some plant specimens the Lhama has provided the pair to study. The Lhama explains the plant is used to treat skin rashes. Explaining that it is the wrong time of year to collect fresh specimens, the Lhama offers his supply to Rollason. The Lhama comments on Fox, known affectionately as Foxy, not liking the tea provided. He mentions that Rollason's wife is brave to come to such a hard, rough place. The Lhama displays his ability to read people very well. Rollason volunteers that he has come to know the mountain, the people, and customs very well through climbing, but an accident caused him to give it up. Another party is six days overdue. The Lhama presses Rollason for details; He seems to sense their visit is not purely a scientific one.Foxy returns to their lab and sleeping accommodation with a plant sample. He asks Helen Rollason (Maureen Connel) for specimen jars. Foxy informs Helen he is ready to leave, ""So I'm ready. The sooner we get out of here, out of this infernal country with its cold, and bad smells, and the superstition."" Helen also reminds him of his dislike for Tibetan tea. Foxy asks Helen to take the jars to her husband. The Lhama continues to inquire about the arriving party and specifically about a man by the name of Friend. The Lhama asks point blank, ""What is this man searching for?"" Rollason is uncomfortable and hesitates to respond, but the Lhama demands an answer and Rollason's interest. Rollason explains his interest is purely a pursuit of scientific knowledge. The Lhama predicts the arrival of Rollason's wife. He then tells Helen she will remain under his protection while her husband engages in his climbing expedition. Both Rollasons register surprise. The Lhama dismisses himself leaving John Rollason to explain his decision to his wife. She is dead set against his climbing and confronts her husband with her concerns over his obsession, ""with the creature."" Outside the monks prepare a ceremony as the party arrives.Tom Friend (Forrest Tucker) arrives, and like the stereotypical ""Ugly American"" begins shouting at the locals and ordering his Sherpas around. Kusang (Wolfe Morris) takes the brunt of the abuse. Rollason comes out to greet Friend. Friend introduces the other members of his expedition, Ed Shelley (Robert Brown) and Andrew McNee (Michael Brill). Friend introduces McNee as Jacques. Helen invites all to join them for dinner of stew. Ed Shelley tells all that will listen, ""I don't know what's worse about it? The stink of everything or the ignorant natives or the filthy food they eat or what. You tell me."" When Shelley finally gets to the heart of the matter--the Abominable Snowman, Helen informs him, ""It doesn't exist."" McNee tells the assembled that he saw their footprints on a prior expedition. Friend shows Rollason a silver container housing a tooth. He believes it is a Yeti tooth. The silver cylinder had been stolen from the monastery some time earlier. Friend intends to return it to the Lhama. Outside the monks start their ceremonial dance. Friend explains his climbing plan and it includes no porters, just the five men. Friend invites Rollason along for his expertise. Rollason, Helen and Friend go to see the Lhama with the tooth. The Lhama explains the tooth was carved and that the Yeti is imaginary. The Lhama warns Rollason that he expects only good intentions on his involvement. Rollason doesn't fully understand or appreciate the advise.The next morning the party departs. Before they leave, Helen makes one last attempt to dissuade her husband, ""It's those men, Friend and Shelley. I don't trust them and I don't like them."" The party sets off and notices three men shadowing them. It is apparent McNee is in no shape for the climb and the three men are definitely following them. Then shots ring out and Kusang is convinced, ""These men bandits. They kill us."" Rollason sees their faces through his binoculars as Shelley scares them away with gun shots of his own. Rollason recognizes the men from the monastery but tells Friend otherwise. They continue their climb up to the hut and provisions placed there earlier. They eat and discuss their plans. Friend asks Rollason for his expert advise, such as what they live on. Rollason tells him, ""Small animals, hares, mice, voles...roots and plants under the snow."" Friend finally explains the real purpose of their expedition. He intends to capture a creature, alive if possible. McNee senses something outside. They exit the hut to see, but it is late. They bed down for the night. Rollason and Friend go back outside for a smoke and to talk. Friend tells Rollason his interest is commercial and he intends to both learn and profit from his expedition.At the monastery, the Friend Expedition porters pester Helen and Foxy for their money. Friend refused to pay them until he returned. Helen is convinced the party is doomed. Foxy goes to talk to the Lhama, but he is in deep meditation and ignores Foxy. Rollason digs up a highly nutritious species of moss, confirming his theory about how the creatures manage to survive in such a harsh environment. McNee volunteers he doesn't trust Tom Friend and observes Rollason doesn't either. Rollason asks why he came. McNee explains the obsession with finding the creatures and that he paid Friend to join the expedition. It is now apparent that McNee is dangerously unsuited for the trek. McNee walks into a spring trap. Rollason tries to free him, but the arrival of Shelley, who set the trap, is able to free McNee's leg. Shelley explains they have already caught a Yeti. They help McNee back to camp. Kusang and Friend show Rollason their Yeti, but Rollason explains it is a Himalayan monkey. Rollason does his best to treat McNee's leg. A weather report on their portable radio indicates a blizzard coming in twenty-four hours. Rollason accuses Friend, ""You're nothing but a cheap fairground trickster."" They scuffle and damage the radio and any future weather reports. A commotion outside, brings them all to investigate. They find the monkey is gone and the cage door torn off its hinges. They see sixteen inch long footprints in the snow. Back in the tent McNee sees a hand of the creature exploring inside. Kusang's screams brings the party to the tent. Kusang bolts the encampment and runs back to the monastery. Friend notices that the traps they set earlier are torn apart. McNee stirs in pain, despite narcotics administered by Rollason. McNee falls back to sleep after Shelley shoots and kills one of the creatures. They follow a bloody trail back to the body lying in the snow. Friend pronounces the find as dead, and at least eleven feet tall.At the monastery, Kusang arrives exhausted and still frightened. Helen witnesses his arrival and tells Foxy. Helen goes to see the Lhama, but gets lost in the building. She explains to the Lhama she saw Kusang and the Lhama confirms only that her husband is in danger but he can do nothing. Foxy takes her back to their quarters. Helen proposes to go find her husband by engaging the porters. They were not paid by Friend, so she pays them with her own funds.McNee is better the next day. Rollason tells him they are moving to the cave and they have a dead creature. They hear the cries of something echoing in the mountains. McNee is strangely drawn to the calls and walks away from camp. He falls from a cliff and is killed. Friend believes the creatures killed McNee. ""It was the sound of that howling. He couldn't stand it; It drove him mad,"" Friend accuses. Several reports from Shelley's rifle brings Rollason and Friend running back to the cave. Shelley is hysterical. He recounts that two very large creatures ran towards him. He is convinced they are after him personally because he killed their comrade. Friend proposes to set a trap in the cave and use Shelley as bait for the creatures. Shelley reluctantly agrees to the plan. Rollason returns to McNee to bury the body. Helen, Foxy and the porters walk up the mountain in search of her husband. Friend explains to Rollason that the tungsten steel net will stop anything. He gives Shelley a cleaned and loaded weapon, but since he wants it alive and Shelley is far too trigger happy, he actually gives him a gun loaded with dummy ammunition. Rollason and Friend return to the tent. A blizzard kicks up and Friend can barely see the cave from the tent. Rollason tries to convince Friend to be satisfied with a dead Yeti, but Friend is adamant--he will settle for nothing less than a live specimen. The creatures spring the trap, and as expected, Shelley fires at them. Rollason and Friend notice the net torn to pieces and Shelley is dead. Rollason attributes the death to a heart attack from fright. He also notices the dummy ammunition. The Yeti came for their dead comrade but left without it.Rollason and Friend bury Shelley next to Andrew McNee. They return to the cave to wait out the storm. Rollason proposes that the Yeti can read their minds, and that they may be just waiting for humans to go extinct to take their place in the world. The cold, altitude, and exhaustion cause them to hallucinate. Rollason hears a weather report on the broken radio. Rollason begins to panic and is cured with oxygen. Next Friend begins to hear calls for help from Shelley. Friend overpowers Rollason and exits the cave to search for Ed Shelley. Revolver shots by Friend start an avalanche that buries him alive. Rollason searches for Friend but finds no trace, and returns to the cave. He sees two creatures inside the back of the cave. One approaches and stares at Rollason.Helen is awakened by the distant howls of the creatures. She exits the hut to get a bearing on the sounds. Foxy wakes and sees that Helen has gone and sets out to search for her. He quickly returns and rousts the porters to join him on the search. Helen finds her husband nearly dead in the snow and large footprints near his body. They return to the Monastery and the Lhama consoles Rollason. To keep their secret and the only chance to keep them alive, Rollason lies and tells the Lhama they don't exist. ""There is no Yeti,"" are the final words uttered by the Lhama. We close with a panoramic shot of the mountains."
tt0050100,"['Comedy', 'contentRating', 'Approved']","A butler, Crichton (Kenneth More), wakes his master Lord Henry Loam (Cecil Parker), a fabulously wealthy English aristocrat with liberal views. The Lord decides that he will hold a tea for everyone in the household, including the many servants, with everyone mixing as equals. Crichton disapproves of the idea, but obeys and the tea is organised. Lord Henry's three beautiful and unmarried daughters are supposed to attend, but one avoids the event by going for a drive into London with her aristocratic boyfriend. The tea is not a success. The servants are embarrassed, and their masters find it all very awkward. Especially haughty is Lord Henry's eldest daughter Lady Mary (Sally Anne Howes). Things are brought to an abrupt end when the telephone rings, and the word arrives that Lord Henry's absent daughter has been arrested for knocking off a policeman's helmet at a suffragette march. The formidable Lady Brocklehurst (Martita Hunt) blames his Lordship's liberal views.The unflappable Crichton suggests to his master that if he were to take a long cruise in his massive luxury yacht, by the time he returned, society would have forgotten the shame of his daughter's arrest. Lord Henry is persuaded, and a trip to the south Pacific is organised.The yacht's engines explode during a storm, and both of its lifeboats are launched. Crichton is the calmest man aboard and realises that Eliza Tweeny (Diane Cilento), a junior servant, has been forgotten in the rush to the lifeboats, and returns alone to rescue her, having by this time already formed an attachment with her. The two servants then dive overboard and swim to the nearest boat, which contains their masters. When criticised for being in the wrong boat, Crichton offers to withdraw.In the morning, there is no sign of the other lifeboat, but land is soon sighted. The boat lands and Crichton sets off inland to find help, entrusting the two aristocratic young men in the party to look after the boat. When he returns with the news that they are on a deserted island, he discovers that one of the men had mistaken a turtle for a rock, and tied the boat to it, and that the boat has been lost.Very quickly it becomes apparent that the only person on the island with any idea of how to survive there is Crichton. Only he can make fire and build shelters. Tweeny is clearly falling in love with him.A ship is sighted, but this turns out to be the abandoned yacht, which then crashes into the island and half sinks. Crichton is the only swimmer strong enough to get to it, and by now even one of the aristocratic women is starting to admire him. He returns with many practical items such as cloth, sewing kits, and cooking gear. The aristocrats complain that they have no decent clothes to wear and no respectable dinner service, and order him to rescue them from the ship. That night, Crichton serves up coconut for the third time for supper. When his masters complain, he points out that he had rescued the things they asked for, and not food. Enraged at this, they give him the sack, and Tweeny leaves with him.The next day, the aristocrats try and fail to cook, hunt, and build shelters. They are miserable at supper time, and then notice the smell of cooking pork coming from the next cove. Going there, they find Crichton and Tweeny enjoying a nice meal of meat, and all but the most haughty, Mary, accept that Crichton is the man to be with.Back in England, Lady Brocklehurst unveils a memorial statue of Lord Henry in his hall. It has been two years since his ship was lost, and he has been presumed dead.Back on the island, we see a servant entering a well-made thatched hut which has a sign ""Government House"" on it. The light is allowed to enter the window, and the master stirs... it is Crichton! The sun shines, and we see that under Crichton's leadership the settlement has flourished. They have running water, huts, hot baths, abundant fruit, and Lord Henry is now acting as butler to his former butler. Crichton still keeps up certain standards, shaving every day. Everyone is happy, but for the fact that their love-lives have not been sorted out. There are four men and four beautiful women on the island, but all the women long to marry their leader Crichton. A beacon stands ready in case a ship is sighted, but no one wants to leave. Crichton has ordered everyone to build a boat to his design, but they are deliberately working slowly on the project, because they don't want to escape.Lady Mary has now fallen in love with Crichton. She has transformed into a Diana-like huntress, and wanders the island barefoot with her bow hunting birds and deer. She finds Crichton diving for pearls, a dives in from a great height to join him. He declares his love for her.That night, they celebrate their second year on the island, and at the feast, Crichton announces his intent to marry Mary. Tweeny is heart-broken. However, all the other men on the island are lusting after Tweeny.Soon after, the wedding is organised, and since one of the aristocrats there is a vicar, a legal ceremony can start. Before the final vows are taken, however, a Royal Navy ship is sighted. Mary pleads for the beacon to be left unlit, but a saddened Crichton decides that he has to light it.Lord Henry, home-sick for news of London, bounds down to the beach to greet the landing sailors. To everyone's amazement, Crichton appears soon afterwards in his butler's uniform, bearing a tray, and having resumed his servile manner.Back in England, a ball is held to celebrate the return of the castaways. Lord Henry is maintaining a fiction that he was the leader of the group. One of the aristocratic young men meanwhile has written a book which has been published, and which hardly mentions Crichton at all. They both are terrified that Crichton will reveal them to be frauds, but Crichton is impeccably behaved. Lady Mary still wants to be the wild woman, and is still in love with Crichton. Lady Brocklehurst senses that the book she has read is a work of fiction, and summons all the castaways together and interrogates them. Without lying, Crichton to the amazement of all answers her questions without giving away the truth that he was the chief of the island.Crichton announces that he will leave Lord Henry's service, much to his Lordship's relief. Lord Henry says that he will go over to the Tories. Crichton shows his master that he has a stash of huge pearls, which should set him up in business. He leaves, taking Tweeny with him. Lady Mary is desolate. Tweeny is delighted."
tt0050195,['Drama'],"Tony Britton has been on a business trip to Germany. He is a highly regarded salesman in his company, and he has been acting as a buyer of mechanical toys on this trip. On his return we see that he has bought an expensive wristwatch for his wife, and he has decided not to declare it to customs on arrival in the UK. Moreover he intends to pay for it by sterling cheque after arrival; both these actions are illegal.The customs officer at his arrival airport in the UK is intrigued by one of the mechanical toys and in operating it, he releases the watch that Britton has concealed in it. Britton is arrested and taken into custody. He is told that he will face trial the next day, and he tries to get a solicitor to represent him. After one refusal, he finds someone who will defend him, but the trial goes badly and he is sentenced to three months in prison.He is immediately taken to a prison, where he finds that as a common criminal, his middle-class background does nothing to protect him from the realities of being a convicted criminal. In fact he finds it difficult to accept his position as a convict among prison officers, and he seems to resent being told what to do by people he considers his social inferiors.His employer doesn't yet know about his arrest and his wife lets them know that he has a severe influenza. Britton intended an appeal at first, but reality strikes home when it is evident that an appeal would cost him money he doesn't have, and it would have little chance of success, as he has pleaded guilty.His wife does some work as a photographic model to keep the family finances afloat. A colleague from Britton's company calls, obviously seeking information, and he discovers the truth, that Britton is in prison, and he ensures that this fact becomes widely known. Britton's company is rather stuffy, and was grudgingly prepared to accept his absence as long as the fact of his imprisonment does not become well known, but now that fact is in the public domain.After two months, with good behaviour, he is released, and at last he is reunited with his wife. He discovers that his employer will not allow him to resume his former position, and he applied to a large number of other companies. As he discloses his prison history, he is repeatedly unsuccessful, and eventually his wife advises him to conceal the fact. he is accepted by a company and is overjoyed, but the new employer telephones his former company. The managing director gives him a glowing reference over the telephone, but he is pressed by non-executive board members to add the fact of the prison stretch.The new company having promised a job now withdraws their offer by post, and Britton is devastated. But the old company's managing director has made a spirited defence of Britton against considerable hostility on the Board, and in the same mail delivery as the rejection from the other company, Britton receives the news that he is to be reinstated in his old post."

One, American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden), is revealed to routinely bribe guards to ensure he is put on the sick list, which allows him to avoid hard labour.A large contingent of British prisoners under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) arrives, defiantly whistling the Colonel Bogey March as they march in. Because they were ordered by their superiors to surrender, Nicholson states that they should be obedient and cooperative prisoners. The Japanese camp commander, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), addresses them, informing them of his rules. He insists that all prisoners, regardless of rank, will work on the construction of a bridge over the Kwai River as part of a railroad that will link all Burma.The next morning, when Saito orders everyone, including officers, to work, Nicholson commands his officers to stand fast. He points out that the Geneva Conventions state that captured officers are exempt from manual labour. Saito is infuriated and backhands Nicholson in the face, but the latter refuses to back down, even after Saito has a machine gun set up threatening to shoot all the officers. Saito is dissuaded from shooting by Major Clipton (James Donald), a British medical officer prisoner, citing an inquiry and scandal should Saito carry through with the murder of officers. Instead, the Japanese commander leaves Nicholson and his officers standing in the intense heat. As the day wears on, one of them collapses from heat stroke, but Nicholson and the rest are still standing defiantly at attention when the prisoners return from the day's work. After Colonel Nicholson is beaten in Saito's quarters, the British officers are sent into a punishment cage and Nicholson into his own box for solitary confinement.When Clipton requests to be allowed to check the officers, Saito agrees on the condition that Clipton persuade Nicholson to change his mind. Nicholson, however, refuses to budge, saying ""if we give in now there'll be no end to it."" In the meantime, construction of the railroad bridge falls far behind schedule, due in part to many ""accidents"" purposely arranged by the British prisoners.Saito has a deadline; if he should fail to meet it, it would bring him great shame and oblige him to commit seppuku (ritual suicide). Saito reluctantly releases Nicholson, telling him that he has proclaimed an ""amnesty"" to commemorate the anniversary of Japan's great victory in the Russo-Japanese War, using it as an excuse to exempt the officers from work. Upon their release, Nicholson and his officers proudly walk through a jubilant reception. Saito for his part breaks down in tears in private.Having recovered from his ordeal physically, but not mentally broken, Nicholson sets off on an inspection of the bridge and is shocked to find disorganization, shirking and outright sabotage on the construction site. He decides that he will build a better bridge than the Japanese soldiers. He orders Captain Reeves (Peter Williams) and Major Hughes (John Boxer) to come up with designs for a proper bridge, despite its military value to the Japanese. He wants to demonstrate to his captors what he considers superior British ingenuity and to also keep his men busy, which he feels would be better for morale than sitting around doing nothing in prison.Meanwhile, three men, one of them the American Shears, attempt to escape. Two are killed; Shears is shot, falls into the river and is swept downstream. After many days in the jungle, he stumbles into a Siamese village, whose residents help him recover and get back to safety. He's given food, water and an outrigger boat to make his way down the river. Shears runs out of water during the trip and is forced to drink the water from the river, which makes him ill. However, he makes it to the mouth of the river and is picked up by British forces and shipped to a British hospital in Colombo, Sri Lanka (at the time, Ceylon). While recuperating, he dallies with a lovely nurse (Ann Sears).Major Warden (Jack Hawkins), a member of the British Special Forces, asks to speak with him. He informs Shears that he is leading a small group of commandos on a mission to destroy the Kwai bridge. He asks Shears to volunteer, since he knows the area. Shears refuses, finally admitting that he is not Commander Shears at all, but a Navy enlisted man. Shears recounts that he and a Navy Commander survived the sinking of their ship, but the Commander was subsequently killed by a Japanese patrol. ""Shears"" switched dog tags with the dead officer, hoping to get preferential treatment in captivity. It didn't work, but then he had no choice but to continue the impersonation. Warden tells him that the military already knew about it. To avoid bad publicity, the U.S. Navy loans him to the British. Warden offers him a deal: in exchange for his services, he will be given the ""simulated rank"" of major on the mission and avoid being charged with impersonating an officer, an offense punishable by death. Thus, Shears reluctantly ""volunteers"" with the understanding that should he survive, he'll get to keep his officer status. They are to be joined by Lieutenant Joyce (Geoffrey Horne), a young eager officer with no combat experience who insists that he won't fold under pressure should he have to kill someone on the mission, and a fourth officer.Back in the camp, Nicholson explains to the Japanese through engineering principles that they've selected a poor site for the bridge. Finally convinced, the original bridge is abandoned and construction of a whole new bridge is commenced 400 yards downriver. Clipton watches in bewilderment as Nicholson maniacally drives his men to complete the project by the deadline. Ironically, he even volunteers his junior officers to assist with the physical labor, something he had refused to consider earlier in the standoff with Saito - provided that the Japanese officers are willing to pitch in as well.Meanwhile, the commandos parachute in. The fourth officer dies due to a bad landing. The rest make their way to the river, assisted by native Burmese women porters and their village chief, Yai (M.R.B. Chakrabandhu). The commandos come upon a Japanese patrol whom they try to kill without firing shots, but Joyce freezes when confronted by one in the jungle. Warden jumps in front of him and kills the Japanese soldier, but gets shot in the foot as a consequence. This slows him down, but Shears refuses to leave him behind and the trio make their way to the bridge with the Burmese helpers.As the prison camp celebrates the completion of the bridge on time with a party for all, Shears and Joyce wire explosives to it under cover of darkness. The next day, a Japanese train full of soldiers and important officials is scheduled to be the first to use the bridge; Warden wants to blow it up just as the train passes over, accomplishing two missions at once.As dawn approaches, the trio notice with horror that the river has receded and the wires and explosives that were hidden the night before are now exposed. Nicholson proudly walks up and down his bridge making a final inspection, and notices the wires. The train can be heard approaching. Nicholson and Saito frantically hurry down to the riverbank, pulling up and following the wire towards Joyce who is waiting by the detonator. When they get too close, Joyce breaks cover and stabs Saito to death. Nicholson yells for help and then tries to stop Joyce (who cannot bring himself to kill Nicholson) from getting to the detonator. A firefight erupts as Warden fires upon the approaching Japanese soldiers; Yai is killed in the gunfight. When Joyce is hit, Shears swims across the river to finish the job, but he too is shot just before he reaches Nicholson.Recognizing Shears, Nicholson suddenly comes to his senses and exclaims, ""What have I done?"" Warden desperately turns the mortar fire in their direction, killing Shears in the blast and mortally wounding Nicholson. The colonel stumbles over to the detonator plunger and falls on it with his dying breath, just in time to blow up the bridge and send the train hurtling into the river.Warden, feeling guilty for killing Shears and Nicholson in the face of shocked stares from the Burmese women, pleads, ""I had to do it! They might have been taken alive! It was the only thing to do!"" Meanwhile, Major Clipton, the British medical officer who has witnessed all the carnage unfold from his vantage point on the hill, shakes his head incredulously, ""Madness! ... Madness!""."

The legend is still told with horror the world over...It is the legend of..."" A clever segway into the title: The Curse of Frankenstein. Credits follow.A man on horseback approaches a prison in the mountains along a narrow pathway. A church bell chimes the hour as a man opens the gate for the rider. He is a priest (Alex Gallier). He is escorted by the Warder (Michael Mulcaster) to see Baron Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing). The warder explains that the prisoner is dangerous. The Baron wishes to see the priest because he thinks he can trust the man with his story. He starts his story, ""I suppose it was when I was a boy at school. I always had a brilliant intellect. When my mother died, I inherited the Frankenstein fortune.""The Young Baron (Melvyn Hayes) is escorting his extended family out of his house after his mother died. His uncle (Raymond Ray) leads the family delegation. Aunt Sophie (Noel Hood) and her daughter, young Elizabeth (Sally Walsh) stay behind. Aunt Sophie wants reassurance her allowance will continue uninterrupted. After confirming the money will continue, Victor quickly escorts the two relatives out the door. As they are leaving, a dapper gentleman in a brown top hat arrives. Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart) walks into the house and presents himself to the new, but very young, Baron. He had corresponded with the Baron for a tutor. Initially he thinks there must be some mistake or a joke, but Victor explains the tutoring is for himself and he is serious. The two hit it off immediately. After two years, ""I learned all he had to teach, but we went on together probing into the unknown, investigating, recording, searching, always searching until gradually the sweep of our research began to assume a single direction and to this aim we finally turned all our energies. It took us years of unrelenting work to discover what we were seeking."" With chemical and electrical apparatus they were able to restore life to a dead puppy. Paul sees the possibilities of their discovery. He notes, ""If we could delay or prolong the period in which the body is apparently dead while the heart is alive wed have a living body with only the barest life-spark present. That what that would mean when it came to performing major surgery!"" Paul wants to write up their findings and present it at a medical conference within a month. Victor expresses his opposition because he wants to experiment further and does not want to share the secret, not yet at least. He proposes the next step. Rather than just restore life, he wants to create life from the beginning. He tells Paul, ""We must build up our own creature, and built it up from nothing. We must create a human beinga perfect human."" Paul disagrees, ""What you're saying is nonsense, a revolt against nature. Such a thing could only end in evil."" Victor persuades Paul to continue the work. He proposes to obtain a body, and knows a highwayman was hanged for his crimes and suggests they retrieve it. They take a horse and cart and cut down the body and return it to their lab. Paul notes that half the head has been eaten away. Victor quickly cuts the head off, explaining it is of no use. He dumps it into a vat of acid in the storage room next door. They remove the old clothes, wrap the body in bandages and place it in a large, glass tank. Now Paul voices his objection to the whole exercise, ""I don't think we should continue with this."" Victor tells Paul he will be leaving for a while but does not explain where or why.Justine the maid (Valerie Gaunt) carries refreshments into the living room and asks Paul if the Baron has returned. She answers the door, expecting that Victor has returned. To her disappointment it is not the Baron but a woman who tells her she was expected and needs help with her luggage. Elizabeth (Hazel Court) is the Baron's cousin and we learn later his fianc√©e. She mistakes Paul for the Baron. Victor arrives home in an excited state calling for Paul. He is not surprised to see Elizabeth. He and Paul rush off to the lab upstairs leaving Elizabeth annoyed and confused.Victor unwraps something from a small black bag. He proudly displays two hands, cut off at the wrist. He explains they are Bardello's hands--the hands of the world's greatest sculptor. Paul voices his objection to exposing Elizabeth to the experiment. He tells Victor, ""While you were away, I decided I could not continue with this experiment."" He tries to convince Victor to stop, but he is unsuccessful. Victor remains in the lab and will graft the new hands on by himself. Paul goes downstairs and tries to convince Elizabeth to leave. In this he is also unsuccessful, mainly because he will not explain the nature of the experiment or the danger. She explains she is to be Victor's wife.Outside the lab, Victor and Justine embrace and kiss. Victor is just toying with the maid. She believes she will be his wife, but Victor tells her that Elizabeth is to be his wife. The next morning Victor prepares to leave on another trip. Elizabeth talks to him about the household accounts and possibly assisting in other ways. Victor pays a visit to the Municipal Charnel House and buys a pair of human eyes. Victor takes them home to examine them when Paul asks to see him. He reiterates his refusal to help Victor with his work. Victor proudly shows Paul how far he has gone on his own. Paul turns away from the tank with revulsion and exclaims, ""It's horrible!"" Victor tells Paul that once a genius brain is obtained and installed the creature will take on a benevolent face. When asked where the brain will come from, Victor replies, ""I'll get it.""Victor and Elizabeth are in the living room entertaining a visitor. Professor Bernstein (Paul Hardtmuth) accepted an invitation from the Baron for dinner and to spend the night. The professor tells Victor that discoveries can be mishandled. Paul enters the room and is introduced to the distinguished professor. Victor escorts the old man upstairs to his room. At the top of the stairs Victor shows him a painting, maneuvering the old man closer to the bannister, which gives way. Victor pushes the old man through and down to his death. Professor Bernstein is given a burial at the Baron's expense and in his family vault. Later that evening the Baron retrieves Bernstein's brain. He carefully places the jar in his bag and prepares to leave the vault. Paul arrives, expecting to find Victor and accuses him of murder. Paul intends to stop Victor from using the brain, and tells him so. They briefly struggle over the bag and the jar is broken.Paul calls on Elizabeth in her room and again begs her to leave. He explains he only stays to ensure her safety. In the lab, Victor is picking pieces of glass out of the brain, trying to salvage it. He puts the brain into the skull and prepares to revive his newly finished creature. He starts the chemical and electrical equipment as an electrical storm brews outside. Paul is upstairs in his room preparing for bed. As the tank empties, Victor goes to Paul's room and again asks for help. He admits, ""That apparatus was constructed for dual operation. You know that. I thought I could work it myself, but I can't."" But Paul gleefully replies, ""I'm delighted."" A lightning bolt starts the electrical components and the body in the empty tank begins to breathe. Victor promises that after the experiment is completed he will dispose of the body. Paul reluctantly agrees to help. Victor returns to the lab and hears glass breaking. He unlocks the lab door and standing there is the creature. It pulls away the bandages covering its head to reveal a scarred and hideous face (Christopher Lee). One eye is blue, the other brown, and it stares at its creator with hate. It grabs Victor and chokes him. Only Paul's quick action saves Victor. He breaks a chair over the thing's head. The creature stumbles and falls to the floor. Paul demands the creature be destroyed as Victor straps it down to a table. Victor tells Paul he will operate on the brain the next morning and try to correct its homicidal tendencies. But the next morning the lab is a shambles and the window broken. The creature has broken free and escaped.Victor and Paul search the countryside for the creature. An old blind man (Fred Johnson) and his grandson (Claude Kingston) are out in the woods for a stroll. The old man sits and the grandson goes down to the lake shore to pick mushrooms. The creature encounters the old man. After a brief exchange he kills the old man. The grandson returns to where he left his grandfather. Victor and Paul find signs and follow it into the woods. They find it, and Paul shoots the creature through the eye. The creature falls and is pronounced dead. They bury it in place and return to the house.Paul goes to the lab and tells Victor he is leaving. With the creature dead, he no longer needs to stay and protect Elizabeth. But Paul doesn't know Victor dug his creation up and returned its lifeless body back to the lab. Victor stares at his creature hanging in the store room and promises, ""I'll give you life again."" Victor is dressed and tells Justine she can serve dinner. Justine reminds Victor of his promise to marry her. Her trump card is the revelation she is pregnant with his child. He does not believe he is the father, but Justine informs the master that Elizabeth will believe her. She adds that she will go to the authorities regarding the experiment. He fires the maid and orders that she leave the next morning. That night Justine goes up to the lab to get the proof she will need for the authorities. Victor leaves the lab door unlocked and Justine enters for a look. She enters the storage room and finds the revived creature. When she tries to flee, Victor locks her in, knowing his homicidal creation will kill her. It does.A week later, Victor and Elizabeth are having breakfast. Elizabeth inquires about Justine. Victor lies and tells her, ""I expect some village lothario eloped with her."" They discuss the wedding plans. Elizabeth reveals she invited Paul. Instead of being angry, Victor casually informs her he hopes Paul comes. He says that he has something to show Paul.It is the eve of the wedding, and a reception at the Baron's home is underway. The Burgomaster (Andrew Leigh) is enjoying the laced punch and practicing his speech. His wife (Ann Blake) reproaches her drunk husband and they leave for home. When all the guests have left, Victor announces he will be working in the lab. Elizabeth is disappointed and tells her future husband. Paul does not attend the reception, but does come later that evening. Elizabeth tells Paul to go surprise Victor. Victor is preparing a plate of flood when Paul knocks on the lab door. Victor invites his old tutor into the lab. He leads him to the storage room. Paul is shocked to discover the creature chained to the wall and showing signs of brain surgery. Victor orders the creature onto its feet. It struggles but stands, then sits when ordered. Paul chides the Baron about the creature's lack of perfection, but Victor reminds Paul, ""There you see the result of your handiwork as much as mine...but you damaged it. You put a bullet in the wretched thing. This is your fault, Paul."" Paul exits the lab, promising to go to the authorities and have them destroy the creature. Victor chases after him. He leaves the lab door unlocked and Elizabeth enters the lab. The creature breaks its chains. Elizabeth enters the storage room and sees the vat of acid. The creature gets out onto the roof. Victor and Paul see it and Paul goes to the village for help. Elizabeth goes outside to explore a noise she heard. Victor grabs a pistol and goes out to the roof. Firing at the creature he hits Elizabeth, then the creature. Only wounded, the creature approaches Victor. A well-aimed toss of an oil lamp sets the creature ablaze. The creature falls through the skylight and straight into the acid filled vat below.We return to the prison, and the priest still listening to the story now finished. Victor concludes, ""My life's work destroyed. Destroyed in a moment. And by the same hand that gave it life."" Paul comes to visit Victor at the prison. Elizabeth was only wounded and recovers. She is also at the prison, but stays in the waiting area. Victor begs Paul to tell the priest about the creature and to verify the story, but Paul denies it. He does accuse Victor of murdering Justine. Victor claims it was the creature who murdered the maid. The priest leaves the cell. Victor tries to kill Paul, but the jailer prevents it. Paul leaves the cell and returns to talk to Elizabeth. He takes her home. Victor is led to his execution. The last scene is of a guillotine, seen in silhouette, and the credits roll."

Although Rhodes is coarse and abusive, he possesses a colloquial, on-air charm that quickly endears him to the hearts and minds of rural listeners after Marcia Jeffries (Neal), a small-town radio personality, discovers him in the county jail of the fictional town of Pickett, in northeast Arkansas, and lands him a radio show there. A talent scout invites him to appear on television in Memphis, Tennessee, where Rhodes is introduced to Mel Miller (Matthau), a bookish Vanderbilt graduate who writes his scripts. However, Rhodes makes a name for himself by insulting his sponsor to the delight of his adoring audience. Rhodes's sponsor, the ""Luffler Mattress"" company, is offended but forced to relent in canceling the show when they discover Rhodes's antics are actually increasing their sales (and that the wife of owner Luffler is a Lonesome Rhodes fan).An opportunistic ""office boy"" (portrayed by Anthony Franciosa) lands Rhodes a contract in New York City, where he becomes the national TV spokesman for Vitajex, an innocuous dietary supplement. A frenetic montage of Rhode's hyperbolic ads for Vitajex is one of the film's most memorable sequences, revealing the gullibility of the American public to a persuasive con-artist. In the tradition of classical tragedy, Rhodes is undone by his thirst for power and by Jeffries who, despite building his stardom, becomes so fed up that she allows him to expose his contempt for his fans on the air.As a ""Cracker Barrel"" broadcast ends, Rhodes is shown, with sound off and an announcer doing a voiceover, smiling and waving to the camera as he speaks contemptuously of his audience. In the control room, Jeffries and the technical staff hear him continue to mock his viewers as ""idiots,"" ""morons,"" ""guinea pigs."" Fed up with Rhodes' betrayal, aware she helped create the monster, Jeffries pushes slide switches that throw Rhodes's comments on the air. In minutes, furious, betrayed fans who heard the remarks are calling the network. In a symbolic moment, an unaware Rhodes's popularity is shown plummeting as he rides an elevator down following the show. The film ends with a meltdown at Rhodes's penthouse apartment, as Jeffries admits she betrayed him and Matthau predicts his future, that he'll return to the air but it won't be quite as fancy. An uncredited Rip Torn is shown at one point as ""Barry Mills,"" the next young Lonesome Rhodes waiting in the wings.Interviewed for the DVD release in 2006 and the documentary accompanying the film, Griffith, Neal and Franciosa all express pride in their work in the film, and Schulberg explains the film's origins."

A sentry (Sheldon Allan) stops to light a cigarette on his rounds when he hears strange noises coming from the woods. Hearing a scream coming from the woods the sentry runs to investigate. He finds the body of a man his face hideously distortedSometime later base security officer Al Chester (Terry Kilburn) and his Commander Major Jeff Cummings (Marshall Thompson) discuss the death. The FBIs report on the dead man indicates no criminal record of suspect connections. Chester suggests handing over the incident to the local authorities for investigations.They then check in with Dr Warren (Gil Winfield) who intended to do an autopsy on the man. Dr Warren reports Mayor Hawkins (James Dyrenforth) and Dr Bradley (Peter Madden) from the local county coroners department claimed the body before he could examine it.Col Butler (Stanley Maxted) calls Cummings to a meeting with Mayor Hawkins and the dead mans Sister Barbara Griselle (Kim Parker) Griselle and Hawkins point blank refuse to allow the military to conduct the autopsy. Butler then shows Barbara her brothers diary found where he was killed. Butler demands to know why her brother was keeping meticulous records of flight operations around the base. Griselle is furious at the invasion of privacy and Butlers very selective reading of the diary. She shows him pages of notes in the diary where her brother was tracking milk production of his herd and trying to correlate the falling production with the increasing aircraft activity.Later Cummings drives Barbara home; he apologizes for Butlers and explains the General had no real malice towards her brother, rather he was just doing his job. She takes the apology on face value and seems engaged by Cummings warm tones of reconciliationAn unknown time later, Cummings is supervising an experimental radar test at the base. It is hoped they can increase the range of current technology and begin directly monitor Soviet air activity in Siberia. The key to success is the amount of power they can run through the system. For this a small atomic reactor was built at the base.The test progresses normally and Cummings begins calling for more power to be delivered. His engineer warns they are in danger of overloading the reactor. Initially the technology begins to show promise before a sudden power drain kicks in. Butler is frustrated by the result. They know they are producing enough power, but beyond a certain point they are not delivering that power to the systemNearby at a farm owned by the Adams, Amelia Adam (Lala Lloyd) hears a strange noise in the barn. She goes to investigate and catches sight of something moving through the hay stored in the barn. Before she can react she is attacked and killed.Her husband, Ben (Meadows White) hears the commotion and runs to her aid. He in turn is attacked and defends himself briefly with a pitchfork against the unseen attacker before also being killedAt the funeral of Barbaras brother, people begin to hear about the double fatalities. Mayor Hawkins immediately blames the airbase and calls Butler with a series of accusations. Capt Chester tries to investigate but is ordered away from the crime scene by a local police officer,Howard Gibbons (Robert MacKenzie)Finally a joint autopsy is arranged, both Doctor Bradley and Warren have no trouble agreeing on their findings. All the victims have two small holes at the base of the skull. Further investigation shows that the entire brain along with the spinal cord is missing.Butler vows to get to the bottom of the mystery. He contacts the top medical and scientific experts in the Pentagon and instructs Cummings to get out among the villagers and see what they know.Cummings begins with Barbara. She works for Professor Walgate (Kynaston Reeves) transcribing his notes for scientific papers. Cummings is aware of Walgate and his extended interest in paranormal activity. Cumming senses a mutual attraction from Barbara, and begins to act on the emotion. Howard Gibbons interrupts the moment and an altercation occurs with Gibbons accusing Cummings of tom catting. Barbara breaks up the fight and orders Cummings from the house.Cummings thinks he might have something and gets Chester to locate everything Walgate has published to see if any of his previous work can be connected with the deaths.Later that night Mayor Hawkins retires to bed when something invisible begins entering the house. Roused by the strange sounds Hawkins investigates and is killed instantly by an apparently invisible entity.News of Hawkins death set the town on edge. Constable Gibbons tries to calm the situation by arranging for a posse to go into the woods. Gibbons is convinced some sort of maniac is hiding in the woods. This seems to have the desired effect of getting the towns energy directed to something positive.Further background information about Walgate comes through from the FBI. He is considered eccentric but definitely a genius. Armed with this new information Cummings visits Walgate, he explains to the scientist the problems the deaths are causing. Walgate has worked out the reason for the base and the need for its own nuclear reactor. Although he gets every detail correct, Cummings admits to nothing.Walgate then focuses of the deaths and seems to take an unhealthy interest in the facial expressions of the dead. The professor suddenly turns very aggressive to Cummings. Barbara breaks up the conversation blaming Cummings dismissively and throws him out yet again.The posse Gibbons organized continues their sweep of the forest well into the night. Close to dawn, two of the men well away from the main group hear something odd in the trees. They go to investigate and get separated. One of the men becomes spooked and retreats shouting assistance.At daybreak the search parties return to the town without finding Howard Gibbons. A council meeting is called. Cummings is invited to the meeting to explain the Air Force position. He begins by reinforcing there no radiation involved and records and confirmed there are no missing military personnel to explain the deaths
The meeting is broken up when Gibbons stumbles into the meeting.He seems to be severely mentally retarded an incapable of normal speech. After the meeting Cummings confides to Barbara he thinks Walgate is behind the problems. For no apparent reason he tells Barbara he is going to investigate the cemeteryIn one of the vaults he finds a passage leading deep underground. He finds the newly interned body of the Mayor and Walgate's favorite pipe. Suddenly from above he hears the vault door close, and realizes he's trapped. Finding two candles and begins to explore the vault in hope of finding another exit.At the base Capt Chester cant find Cummings. Calling Barbara he finds out that Cummings is probably at the cemetery. Chester stops to collect Barbara so they can continue on to the cemetery. Once there they hear strange thumping noises and realize Cummings is trapped in one of the vaults.Cumming then confronts Walgate over what has been occurring. He is convinced Walgate has developed some form of mind control. Walgate refuses to answer till Cummings shows him the pipe he retrieved from the vault. Walgate finally seen Cummings and intentionally locked him in the vaultWalgate explains he was examining the Mayor to determine the cause of death. Walgate seems to have a stroke and mutters something about shutting down the power plant before passing out. Cummings goes to Butler and after arguing Butler agrees to shut downAt the power plant the process for shut down commences and the technicians realize all the rods controlling the pile have been smashed. Butler immediately organizes emergency replacements. A call comes through; Walgate has regained consciousness and wants to speak to the base commander in person.Walgate explains his theory of thought amplification, he realized telepathy was not the answer and he needed to find a way to produce an entity powered by will power. He had been using electrical energy to power the process, after many failed experiments; he is in the middle of trying again when the house is hit by lighting. The extra power allowed him to turn the page of a book using only thoughtHe now understood that power was the key to the process, and began designing more powerful tests. His work progresses to a point where even a bigger power source was needed. When the airbase was constructed he worked out how to draw on the energy from the atomic powerEventually he created a life form based entirely on thought and hence invisible. One night, he discovers his lab in a shambles. Instinctively he knew his new creature had escaped. Instead of creating something to benefit man, he'd created a fiend. He also believed there was more than one. When the first of the deaths occurred he decided that it was his fiends behind it.One of Butlers men sees a commotion outside and investigates. Butler tries to call the base but discovers the line has been cut. The solider outside screams and is instantly dead. Butler understands the danger and orders the others to begins to barricades themselves in the room.Walgate is asked how they can be rendered visible; he surmises that with enough power from the pile it could be done. Back at the installation one of the technicians becomes concerned at the fluctuations he is seeing in the power levels, as be checks instruments he is killed by one of the creatures.Now with unlimited power available, one of the creatures attains visibility. It is nothing more than a brain attached to a spinal cord and a number of tentacles protruding from the brain stem. It moves using a clumsy worm like motion.Back at the house another creature begins to attack, Melville (Launce Maraschal) becomes panicked at the enclosed situation.

tt0050539,"['Horror', 'SciFi']","Six months, after an exposure to a strange and radioactive mist, Scott Carey begins to shrink. After facing such trials as confounded doctors and his angry cat, he accidentally gets locked in the basement, where he must battle a spider.===================================================The title and credits are in white font over a black background, which dissolves to a swirling fog. We open on the shore with waves gently rolling on to a beach, then a boat gently bobbing on the ocean. Robert Scott Carey (Grant Williams) narrates a few lines, ""The strange, almost unbelievable story of Robert Scott Carey, began on a very ordinary summer day. I know this story better than anyone because I am Robert Scott Carey."" Carey and his wife of six years, Louise (Randy Stuart) are resting on the bow of his brother's boat. They are on vacation and soaking up some sun. Louise goes below to get Scott a beer. A strange cloud or patch of fog approaches. Scott attempts to make his way below, but the shimmery fog coats his head and body with what appears to be glitter before he can do so.Six months later the milkman makes his morning delivery to the Carey home. Louise gives the cat some of the milk then goes into the house to finish preparing breakfast. Scott asks about his clothes. They are too loose. Pants and shirts are too large. He is losing weight and chides his wife about her cooking as the cause. He asks Louise to pick up a bathroom scale. Increasingly concerned, he visits his family physician, Dr. Arthur Bramson (William Schallert) and is told his height measures five-feet and eleven inches. Scott informs the doctor, ""I've been six foot, one-inch since I was seventeen."" The doctor chalks his weight loss up to overwork and stress. He reassures Scott that, ""People just don't get shorter."" A week later Scott notices even his bathrobe doesn't quite fit right. When Louise suggests a visit to the doctor, Scott informs her he saw a doctor a week ago. They prepare for bed and he kisses his wife and notices he's getting shorter. He gets in bed and plays with his cat, Butch. He returns to see Dr. Bramson again. Now Bramson has a series of X-rays taken at different times to compare. He confirms that Scott is indeed getting smaller. He is at a loss to explain why. He refers Scott to the California Medical Research Institute. More tests and X-rays follow. Dr. Thomas Silver (Raymond Bailey) tells Scott that he is losing vital chemical elements, Nitrogen, Calcium and Phosphorus. The doctor does find something that doesn't belong--he describes it as an anti-cancer. The doctor asks about exposure to insecticide. Scott tells him two months before he passed a truck on the highway that was spraying trees. Next the doctor inquires about a radioactive exposure. Scott says no, but Louise reminds him of the mist on Charlie's boat six months earlier. The two different exposures combined to start a process in Scott's body that causes him to shrink. Scott and Louise get in their car. They talk about the implications of his condition and their marriage. Before they drive off, Scott's wedding ring falls off his shrinking ring finger.His brother, Charlie Carey (Paul Langton), stops by the house to inform Scott that the loss of a major account means no more paychecks. Charlie suggests Scott, now about the size of a five year old, make the nosy reporters pay for his story. In debt and now unemployed, Scott does sell his story. Louise calls the telephone company and asks for an unlisted phone number. Outside a crowd of reporters and gawkers try to see Scott. Louise informs her husband that they must wait for an unlisted line. Scott overreacts and directs his anger at Louise. Their marriage is starting to show signs of stress. Scott's behavior towards her, the incessant phone calls, and the pounding on their front door is too much for Louise. She begins sobbing. She tries to reassure Scott that the doctors are working on an anti-toxin.Scott keeps a journal. He notes today's numbers--his height (36 ¬Ω inches) and weight (52 pounds). Louise is in the basement working on a dress. The phone rings, Scott answers, and tells his wife, ""The anti-toxin, they found it."" Dr. Silver injects Scott and reminds them both that there is no guarantee. He gives the odds as 50/50. Scott must stay at the institute for a week. The next week Scott, Louise, Dr. Silver and his nurse (Diana Darrin) meet. The nurse reports Scott is the same height and weight as a week before. Dr. Silver tells Scott it seems the process has stopped, but re-growing back to a normal size is an entirely different matter. Scott becomes morose; His marriage is deteriorating. He grabs his coat and leaves the house. He walks over to a carnival. The Carnival Barker (Frank Scannell) introduces one of his acts, a 36 ¬Ω inch midget. Scott realizes the world sees him as a freak. He leaves the carnival without entering and walks over to a Caf√© for coffee. He sits at a table and is greeted by a woman, Clarice Bruce (April Kent). Her friend (Billy Curtis) reminds her not to be late for the show before he leaves the caf√©. Clarice joins Scott at his table for coffee. She tells him she was born a midget. She tries to reassure him that life is worth living. She leaves for her show. The outing helped Scott's mood, ""That night I got a grip on life again. I went back to work on my book. It absorbed me completely"". Sometime later he shows the journal to Clarice in the park. It improves his mood greatly. But as they get up off the bench, Scott notices he's shorter than Clarice. ""It's starting again."" He panics and runs off.Scott is now living in a doll house. The house shakes as Louise walks down the stairs. Louise calls out to him and he walks out onto the balcony to speak to her. She informs him she's going out shopping. He reenters his doll house and shuts the door. Louise opens the front door, and then returns to the desk for something. Butch the cat slips in unnoticed. She leaves the house and closes the door. Scott is now about six inches tall. He knows his behavior is worse. He is more tyrannical and demanding with Louise. He contemplates suicide, but he still has hope for a medical cure. The cat sniffs around the doll house. Scott tries to nap inside. He hears the cat sniffing. He picks up a makeshift knife and goes to the door. He opens it. The cat snarls at him. He slams the door shut. Butch goes to an open window of the doll house and paws inside. He scratches Scott. The cat manages to pull the doll house away from the wall enough to get inside. Scott exits and runs under a chair. The cat knocks him down and begins to toy with his potential meal. Scott spots the lamp cord and the lamp on the table above dangerously close to the edge. He pulls the cord, topples the lamp which scares off the cat. This gives him a chance to escape to the basement. He pushes the door closed on the cat, but before he can close it completely the cat pushes back. Louise, re-entering the house, allows a gust of wind to blow the basement door open and flings Scott down into Louise's sewing basket. Louise sees the cat and immediately runs to find Scott. She finds the doll house askew from the wall and Scott missing. She finds the toppled lamp and a scrap of Scott's clothing smeared with blood. She concludes the cat ate her husband.A KIRL news report is broadcast, ""From Los Angeles today, a tragic story. The passing of Robert Scott Carey. The report of the death of the so called Shrinking Man comes from his brother. Carey's death was the result of an attack by a common house cat--a former pet in the Carey home."" Charlie is with Louise and a nurse (Helene Marshall). The nurse tells Charlie that Louise is barely resting despite a sedative.Down in the basement, Scott regains consciousness in the sewing box. He employs a champagne cork to climb up to an opening in the box. He makes it to the basement floor. He's now about three inches tall. He realizes he can't scale the stairs. He calls to his wife, but she can't hear him. A dripping hot water heater provides a source of water, and a match box a shelter. Next on the agenda is a source of food. He uses a nail to cut up his clothes. Charlie talks to Louise about her future. Louise thinks Scott could be alive, but Charlie is sure he is dead. Louise dwells on the circumstances. Charlie makes real estate arrangements for the house. Without food Scott realizes the shrinking process is accelerating. He sees a piece of cheese in a mouse trap. He employs a nail to spring the trap, unfortunately the action causes the cheese to roll into a floor drain. He sees a chunk of cake high on the basement wall. He tries to figure a way up to it. A spider is on the prowl on the basement floor. Scotts sees it and runs. He finds a pin cushion in Louise's sewing kit and grabs a pin as a weapon. He takes another pin and bends it into an ""L"" shape. He ties thread around it. He uses a match to burn the thread to length. He uses his new tool as a grappling hook and scales the thread progressively upwards to the top of a box. Using a paint stick he gets to the other side of the box. He scales a loose piece of string from a ball of string to get to the top of the basement wall. A spider web is partially anchored to the piece of cake. He uses the pin to break off chunks of the stale cake. He sees a basement vent screen and approaches it. The grid is too small to slip through. He weeps in frustration. ""My prison, almost as far as I could see. A gray friendless area of space and time,"" he laments. Scott returns to the cake. He throws a couple of chunks over the wall to the basement floor below. The largest piece is entwined a spider web. He repels down the string. He takes his prize in hand and is chased by the tarantula. He escapes into the relative safety of his match box home. The spider can't get in and leaves. ""In my hunt for food, I had become the hunted,"" he wryly observes.Charlie descends the stairs carrying Louise's suitcases. She tells Charlie she wants a small trunk located in the basement. The hot water heater leak grows larger, now dripping on Scott's match box home. The dripping wakes Scott. He goes out to investigate as the hot water heater leaks becomes a torrent. He is washed off the platform and is washed down towards the floor drain. Charlie and Louise enter the basement and see the flooding. Scott calls out but they can't hear him. Charlie removes some rags that clogged the drain. He picks up the trunk and tells Louise, ""I want you packed and out of this house tonight."" Scott uses a pencil as a life preserver. Charlie and Louise drive away from the house.Scott regains consciousness over the drain. He is cold and wet and faces his old enemy, the tarantula, again. He sizes up his situation. He still has his weapons he retrieved from his matchbox. Scott becomes more philosophical and determined to get that last piece of cake. He makes it back to the top of the basement wall and his food. He plans to use scissors as a weight and his pin and thread to skewer the spider. He picks up a couple of rocks and throws them at the spider. He pulls on anchor threads starting a vibration of the web. The spider descends to the source of the disturbance. It chases Scott who prepares his weapons. He spears the spider, and then pushes the scissors over the ledge. But the string snags on a piece of jagged concrete. The string snaps and the spider continues to chase Scott. Using his other pin he fends off the spider's advance. He runs, but trips and is held down with his pin just out of reach. He manages to work himself free, retrieves his pin, and plunges it into the spider's thorax. It impales itself on the pin. Scott is victorious. Scott walks slowly over to the cake. He breaks off a chunk, and then drops it. He realizes he no longer feels hunger or fear of shrinking. He walks back up to the vent screen, drawn by the light coming in. Scott is now less than an inch tall. He gets through the screen and walks outside looking up at the darkening sky and the full moon. He walks through the yard looking up at the stars. We close with pictures of various types of galaxies and Scott tells us, ""To God there is no zero. I still exist."""

That night, a strong wind blows a bottle of water over onto the rock, which begins to bubble and smolder. The next day, the head of the geological office, Dave Miller, returns to town from a business trip and finds the office destroyed by a huge growth of black rock and Ben dead, in a rock-hard, apparently petrified state. Meanwhile, Dave's girl friend, schoolteacher Cathy Barrett, brings her students to the desert, where little Ginny Simpson pockets a piece of the black rock, later washing it in a basin outside her parents' farm. In town, Doctor Reynolds performs an autopsy on Ben, but when he cannot explain Ben's rigidity, he informs Dave and Police Chief Dan Corey that he is shipping the body to a specialist. Martin returns to the demolished office with Dave, and there recognizes the rock formations as resembling the piece of black rock Ben had been examining. Cathy joins them and, also recognizing the rock, races with the men to the Simpson farm. They find it in ruins under a pile of black rock, and Ginny's parents dead. The girl, however, is in a catatonic state, and they rush her to the care of specialist Dr. Steve Hendricks, at the California Medical Research Center. He soon reports that she is slowly turning to stone, and posits that her only hope of survival lies with identifying the black rock within the next eight hours. Dave brings the rock to his old professor, Arthur Flanders, who assumes that it is from a meteor. Together they visit the Simpson farm, where Arthur notices a discoloration in the ground and deduces that the rock is draining silicon from whatever it touches, including humans. They then go to the desert, where they trace fragments of the rock to a huge meteor. Fretting that the meteor contains billions of years worth of space secrets, which they have only hours to discover, Dave sends the new information to Steve, who prepares a synthetic silicon solution and injects it into Ginny. While a storm brews outside, Dave and Arthur continue to investigate what causes the rock to grow, and after a piece of rock falls into the sink and begins to bubble, they realize that water is the culprit. Noticing the rain, they drive to the desert, where the small pieces of rock are mixing with water to form huge monoliths that rise from the earth and then crash into hundreds of pieces, each becoming another monolith. They report their findings to Dan, who plans to evacuate the town, even though the weather bureau reports that the rain will soon stop. At the hospital, Ginny finally stirs, and Dave deduces that Steve's silicon solution can be used to control the rocks. Soon, however, more locals are rushed to hospital in the throes of the petrification process, and the rock continues to grow. With little time to announce their findings to the town, Dave and Dan turn to Martin to round up the paperboys and spread the word. The governor soon declares a state of emergency, and Dave and Arthur struggle to convert the formula to one that will retard the rock growth, failing until they realize that the key lies in the simple saline solution Steve used on Ginny. While casualties mount, Dave figures out a way to dynamite the local dam and flood the nearby salt flats, thus creating a large supply of salty water near the canyon edge. Knowing that they must halt the rock's growth at the canyon edge or lose all hope of survival, Dave ignores the governor's refusal to give permission to the risky project, and sets up dynamite stations around the dam. Arthur doubts that the water will be able to absorb enough salt for the plan to work, but Martin cites hopeful statistics he has learned from years of reporting on the salt flats, and the team is cheered by his certainty. With only minutes left until the monoliths reach the canyon edge, Dan orders the dynamite to be detonated, and the group watches in fear as the water flows over the monoliths. The plan at first seems to fail, but finally the rock growth slows, and Dan holds Cathy as the last huge formation crashes to a standstill."

tt0050766,"['Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","Before the credits, there is footage of a stone circle with a voiceover concerning demon worship and witchcraft over the centuries which still endure today.The film starts with Professor Harrington (Maurice Denham) drving through the night to Lufford Hall, the magnificent residence of Dr. Julian Karswell (Niall MacGinnis) with whom he pleads to ""call it off"". Karswell, noticing the time, ushers Harrington out and telling him he will do all he can.As he arrives home Harrington hears a strange noise and through the night can see a huge demon approaching. He attempts to drive away but reverses his car in to an electricity pole, staggers out of it and is caught in the sparking cables as the demon reaches down to claw at his body.Cut to the interior of an aeroplane where Dr. Holden (Dana Andrews) is attempting to sleep. Over his face is a newspaper and visible is an article headlined ""Prominent Psychologist Flies to London for International Convention"" bears his photograph. In the seat behind him is a young woman -- Joanna Harrington (Peggy Cummins).Holden is met at the airport and discusses the convention he is attending with waiting journalists. Meanwhile Joanna Harrington attempts unsuccessfully to telephone Professor Harrington's house.Holden meets up with two of his fellow delegates Professors Mark O'Brien (Liam Redmond) and K.T. Kumar (Peter Elliot). O'Brien and Holden discuss the case of Rand Hobart (Brian Wilde) -- a member of the Karswell ""devil cult"" which Holden intends to denounce at the conference. Hobart is in a lunatic asylum for murder, although he claims that the killing was done by a demon. Under hypnosis Hobart has produced a drawing of a demon which bears striking similarities to various other drawings of demons produced over the centuries.The telephone rings and it is Karswell, who attempts to warn Holden off.The following morning Holden goes to the reading room of the British Museum, where he discovers that 'The True Discoveries of the Witches and Demons' --- mentioned in Prof. Harrington's notes --- is missing.In the reading room, Karswell approaches him and offers to let Holden use his library of books on witchcraft and demonology --- which includes a copy of 'The True Discoveries of Witches and Demons', inviting him to visit him at Lufford Hall. Karswell gives Holden a card, and ""accidentally"" upsets the papers on his desk, apologises and hands them back to him. He leaves. Holden looks at the card and finds that as well as karswell's name and address it also has ""In memoriam Henry Harrington allowed two weeks"" in glowing letters. He watches Karswell walk away and is suddenly overcome with dizziness and blurred vision. He shows the card to an assistant in the library, but the ""In memoriam..."" text has disappeared. He next takes the card to a chemist (Chalres Lloyd Pack) who can find nothing wrong with the card.Cut to the church in which the funderal of Professor Harrington is being held. Holden and Joanna Harrington recognise each other from the aeroplane. Joanna tells Holden that they must speak and they meet at Holden's hotel that evening. She advises Holden to drop his investigation of the Karswell cult.She reads from her uncle's Diary, where he recounts that Karwell gave him a concert programme which contained a parchment with runes written on it, which acted as if it were alive and flew in to the fire and was burned; and that ever since he has been pursued by strange lights and has had various other signs of the supernatural. The chemist telephones Holden to inform him that the card on which he saw the writing has come back clean: there is no sign of any ink on the card.Holden and Joanna Harrington drive out to Lufford Hall, where they find Karswell performing magic tricks for a group of children. Holden and Karswell talk about 'The True Discoveries of Witches and Demons', which Karswell informs Holden was written in cypher, and that he has de-cyphered. Holden continues to be sceptical, so Karswell offers to conjure a wind-storm. He concentrates for a few seconds and a tremendous storm appears from nowhere.Karswell and Holden run indoors to avoid the storm. Karswell explains to Holden that -- like Prof. Harrington before him -- he has put a curse on him, which will lead to his death three days hence. Meanwhile Karswell's mother (Athene Sayler) is showing Joanna Harrington Karswell's copy of a book (presumably 'The True Discoveries of Witches and Demons'), which neither of them can understand. Holden and Joanna Harrington leave Lufford Hall.Back at the hotel, as Holden walks along the corridor he begins to hear the strange noise which preceded the manifestation of the demon which killed Prof. Harrington but it is interrupted by the door of a room opening. Talking with O'Brien and Kumar, Holden is still sceptical. O'Brien looks in Holden's diary and discovers all the pages after the date which Karswell has arranged for his death have been torn out.Holden has dinner with Joanna at Prof. Harrington's house. Joanna continues to read from her uncle's journal, and Holden discovers that the pages of Prof. Harrington's diary after the date of his death had been torn out. Still sceptical Holden tells Joanna that even if a curse did exist, he couldn't have been subject to it as a paper has to be passed -- secretly -- to the victom of the curse. He goes through the papers in his briefcase and discovers that amongst those returned to him by Karswell in reading room is one bearing a runic script. The paper flies from his hand towards the fire but is stopped by the fire-guard. Holden retrieves it.The following day Holden visits Rand Hobart's -- who are also members of the cult -- family to seek their permission for him to be released from the asylum temporarily to be examined at the conference. Hobart's mother signs the release paper and as he goes to put it in his wallet the runic parchment makes another bid to escape.Holden then arranges to meet Joanna, who has been invited to a seance by Karswell's mother. The seance is run by Mr. Meek (Reginald Beckwith). During the seance, Mr. Meek goes in to a trance and begins to ""channel"" Prof. Harrington who has a message for Joanna that Karswell has successfully translated the book and that the demon is real. Holden leaves the seance in disgust, still refusing to believe that demons exist. Joanna and Holden decide to drive out to Lufford Hall to try and find Karswell's translation of the book. Holden breaks in to Karwell's study, where he is attacked by what appears to be a wild-cat [more accurately, he wrestles with an evidently stuffed cat -- the effects in this bit are less than convincing]. Karswell appears and the ""wild cat"" has now assumed the form of an ordinary cat, and Karswell informs Holden that it is a minor demon.Against Karswell's advice, Holden returns to his car through the woods. On his journey he sees huge smoking footprints appear in the path at his side, followed by a strange smoky apparition and the strange noise. They phenomena disappear. Holden and Joanna go to the police who dismiss them as a pair of cranks.The following morning Holden is having breakfast with Kumar and O'Brien. He refuses to accept a call from Karswell's mother who keeps trying to call him. Karswell's mother then telephones Joanna and tells her to tell Holden that Rand Hobart knows how to reverse the curse. Joanna then goes to her car and is about to leave when someone steps out of the bushes and prevents her...Hobart is brought by ambulance to the conference, and Holden explains to the delegates that he and O'Brien will use hypnosis to bring Rand Hobart out of his catatonic state. Hobart is injected by O'Brien with stimulants, and regains consciousness but begins screaming wildly until Holden hypnotises him. Holden shows his runic parchment to the hypnotised Hobart who then he reveals that he was going to be the original victim of the demon, rather than the man of whose murder he is accused. In order to reverse the curse he had secretly to pass the parchment containing the runic inscription back the person who gave it originally. Hobart then breaks free and then dives through a window to his death.Finally convinced of the reality of the curse, Holden decides to return the parchment to Karswell and is informed by Kumar that Mrs. Karswell had told telephoned to say her son would be on the 8.45 to train to Southampton. Holden just catches the train as it pulls out of the platform. As it does so, visible on it are two plain-clothes police-officers. He finds Karswell, who has Joanna with him, whom he has hypnotised.Holden attempts to pass Karswell an envelope containing what he claims to be a retraction. Karswell refuses to take it, fearing it is the runic one. He similarly refuses a cigarette. As the time approaches 10.00 Karswell makes to leave, but Holden insists that he stay to be present when the demon is due to arrive. The police are, however, waiting for him and come in to the carriage and restrain Holden.Karswell makes to leave, and Holden passes his coat to the policeman -- secreting the paper in its pocket. The policeman passes the coat to Karswell who takes it but then instantly realises his error, and pulls the paper out of the pocket. It flies out of his hands and goes dancing down the railway track, with Karswell in pursuit. Holden observes that it is 9.58 (""Two of ten"").Just as Karswell reaches the paper it bursts in to flames and is destroyed. The strange noise which preceded the arrival of the Demon at the beginning of the film is heard again, the strange cloud which pursued Holden through the woods also appears above an oncoming train and the demon appears and destroys Karswell.The police and railway staff rush to see what has happened, and even though he is lying onthe wrong track that a train must have hit him and dragged him due to the mutilation of the body. Holden and Joanna refuse to look because ""it's better not to know"".The end."

tt0050778,"['Horror', 'SciFi']","The opening shot is of a young couple (Gail Ganley and Ralph Reed) in a sports car necking. She excuses herself and the boy drives off. The girl is approached by a man carrying a silver briefcase. He removes his sunglasses and she screams and collapses on the lawn. The man removes a rubber hose and needle and attaches it to her neck and empties her blood into vials in his case. We get a close up his eyes and they are just milky white orbs. Title and credits run over pen and ink drawings.Note: Paul Birch left the picture before principle photography was completed. Lyle Latell completed his scenes.A Cadillac pulls up to a hospital, on the wrong side of the road, next to a fireplug, and in front of a no parking sign. Paul Johnson (Paul Birch) enters the hospital. He is greeted by Nurse Nadine Storey (Beverly Garland). He has come for a transfusion of blood. He refuses a blood test, which both the doctor and nurse find incomprehensible. Dr. F.W. Rochelle (William Roerick) comes out of his office and invites Mr. Johnson in. Dr. Rochelle explains no doctor on earth would do a transfusion without knowing the blood type of a patient. Johnson walks over to the lab bench, grabs a scalpel and cuts his wrist. There is no bleeding. Johnson explains to the doctor that it will bleed later. Johnson telepathically communicates with Rochelle. He agrees to the blood test, but swears the doctor to secrecy. Rochelle begins studying Johnson's blood as Nadine gives him his transfusion. Johnson asks Nadine to work for him. She agrees only if the doctor approves, which he does. Rochelle's orders are for a daily infusion of 500 cc of type ""O"" every night.A motorcycle police officer, Harry Sherbourne (Morgan Jones) is making his rounds when he sees Johnson's car. He prepares to write a ticket for multiple violations when Nadine and Johnson exit the hospital. Nadine and Harry know each other and she convinces him not to write up Mr. Johnson. She explains Johnson is very sick, so Harry agrees to escort Johnson home. At Johnson's residence, he is greeted at the door by his chauffer and butler, Jeremy Perrin (Jonathan Haze). Johnson tells Jeremy to prepare a room for the nurse. Johnson goes to the kitchen and removes several vials of blood and places them in the refrigerator. When finished, he goes down into the basement. Jeremy enters the kitchen, which he was expressly told not to do. He pulls out a clear cylinder and as he tries to open it, he is frozen by Johnson telepathically. Johnson tells Jeremy if he spies on him again he ""will be eliminated.""Nadine drives her car to the Johnson residence. She is carrying a single suitcase. Before she can ring the doorbell, Jeremy greets her. He makes a clumsy pass and she rebuffs him. He finds her attractive, she is disinterested. She enters the living room and apologizes for her late arrival. She explains to Johnson that she had to clean out her desk at the hospital. Johnson escorts Nadine to her room upstairs. He departs but locks her door from the outside. She objects and tells Johnson if her door is to be locked, she'd prefer to do it herself. Johnson returns to the living room, which seems to double as a bedroom. He retrieves a communication device and calls his home planet of Davanna. The closet has been converted into a matter transporter. A floating head, ""the courier"" (January Boleslavsky) communicates with Johnson telepathically and relays the current and dire conditions on his home world. We learn that the earth is under study from these aliens like Johnson. They need huge quantities of blood as a result of war and radioactivity. Johnson is given his marching orders in six phases:
1)	Study humans.
2)	Return more blood home.
3)	A live human for research to be teleported to Davanna.
4)	Johnson is Phase 4--Earth blood transfusions.
5)	If Earth blood keeps him alive--conquest, subjugation and pasturing of the Earth's population.
6)	If Johnson dies, destroy the Earth.The next morning Jeremy prepares breakfast for Johnson. Under his jacket he carries a gun. He delivers Johnson his breakfast. Johnson tells Jeremy to prepare the car for a trip to the Public Library. Johnson does not eat solid food. He adds a pill to water, which turns the liquid black, and consumes it. Jeremy brings Nadine her breakfast. He tells her he gets paid $300 a week for practically no work. Nadine takes Johnson's temperature. Nadine has no further duties until evening, so she decides to use the swimming pool.The doorbell rings. Since Jeremy is occupied, Johnson answers it himself and finds a vacuum cleaner salesman, Joe Piper (Dick Miller). Joe turns on the high pressure during the demo. When he mentions the cellar, Johnson becomes interested. He invites him in and escorts him to the cellar. There the boiler or furnace is stoked up and glowing. Joe sets up his equipment and comments about the dirt in the drain pipe. Johnson removes his sunglasses and when Joe looks at him he does a double take, screams and falls back dead. Johnson has his suitcase ready and drains the salesman's blood. When he is done he stuffs the body into the furnace.Jeremy is driving Johnson to the library. Along the way he encounters three winos. When Johnson asks about the ""three gentlemen"", Jeremy tells him they are just bums. Johnson mumbles, ""Phase 2."" He tells Jeremy to invite all three to dinner tonight. Jeremy is shocked and horrified, but has learned to just follow strange orders by the boss.Harry Sherbourne is driving and notices Dr. Rochelle sitting on a bus bench. His car is in the shop, so Harry offers him a lift. They are both heading to the Johnson residence anyway. By the pool, Nadine notices smoke rising from the chimney. It is a warm day and no one should be using a fireplace or furnace. She walks down into the cellar to investigate. She is carrying her bathing cap. Before she can open the furnace door she notices a large number of Erlenmeyer Flasks. She puts her cap down and picks up an empty flask. She removes the stopper and sniffs. She grimaces from an apparent bad smell. She again approaches the furnace, but before she can open it, she hears a car horn. She puts the empty flask down on a small table next to the stairs and exits the cellar.Harry and Dr. Rochelle arrive. Just as they exit their car, Jeremy pulls up in the Cadillac. Harry recognizes Jeremy, a frequent guest of the police. Nadine takes Harry and Dr. Rochelle into the house. Dr. Rochelle goes into the living room with Johnson. He tells him, ""Your blood is different from any I ever studied in my entire career."" He has a low red blood count and his blood appears to be ""evaporating"" for lack of a better description. Dr. Rochelle thinks it might be a plague and that time is critical. Johnson tells Jeremy to tell Harry to return Dr. Rochelle to his work, and to go to the park and ""collect my dinner guests."" Nadine thinks Jeremy swiped her bathing cap because she can't find it. Johnson is in the cellar churning the ashes in the furnace and stoking it up for later. He picks up her bathing cap. Jeremy collects the winos and returns them to the house. They are in the basement with Johnson drinking when Johnson removes his sunglasses and fries their brains. Johnson loads numerous vials of blood into a trunk and tells Jeremy to move it to the living room. Harry and Nadine walk back to the Johnson residence from a date. Harry warns Nadine to be careful. He refers to the pair in the house as ""a creep and a two-bit crook."" ""I don't like the feel of this place."" Johnson communicates with Davanna. The trunk is teleported. The next item on the agenda is a live subject.At police headquarters, Sgt. George Walton (Roy Engel) is on the phone and discussing a case involving ""neck punctures."" Harry enters the room. So far thirteen people have been killed with the same M.O. He goes on to explain that he has some kind of device that burns out the eyes and brains of his victims, and then he drains them of their blood. He notes that the missing person rate has gone up sharply.Nadine gives Johnson his evening transfusion. He casually asks her if she has any relatives. She tells him, ""Just an Aunt in Detroit who raised me."" After his transfusion Johnson goes on the prowl for a human subject to transport to Davanna. He spots an oriental man (Harold Fong). He telepathically directs the man to follow him home. He is told by the courier that things are devolving into anarchy on Davanna. Johnson reports that he won't know if the treatments are working for three more days. The Chinese man is teleported to Davanna.The next morning Jeremy enters the kitchen with Johnson's untouched breakfast. Nadine examines it. She notices the black water and its vile chemical smell. Jeremy volunteers other odd behavior like the three winos and the Chinese man arriving and never leaving. She decides to take the ""water"" to a lab and have it analyzed. Johnson and Jeremy are preparing to drive into town. Johnson hands Jeremy Nadine's bathing cap. Nadine brings the sample to Dr. Rochelle. She gets a call from Harry. Dr. Rochelle's new nurse, Joanne (Tamar Cooper), brings in a bottle of canine blood infected with rabies. She labels it and puts it in the refrigerator. Nadine and Harry make a dinner date for 6:00 p.m. She invites Dr. Rochelle to join them later at the restaurant with the test results.Johnson is on the street when he recognizes a woman from Davanna (Anna Lee Carroll). She too wears sunglasses. They stop at a magazine stand and telepathically communicate. She explains she came through the transporter at Johnson's home because anarchy reigns back home. He tells her she can help him with his work. She also tells him that transport back through the beam is impossible. The Chinese man was crushed when he arrived on Davanna. She finally tells Johnson she needs blood. While Johnson takes the woman to Dr. Rochelle's lab, Dr. Rochelle joins Harry and Nadine for dinner. Dr. Rochelle tells Nadine the black liquid is a complete food. Nadine finally reveals the source--Johnson. Rochelle blanches, then changes the subject and will not discuss Johnson any further. Back at the hospital, Johnson accidently gives his companion the rabid dog blood for her transfusion. She complains of feeling strangely, but is assured that is normal. She walks to her hotel room, but doubles back to the hospital and collapses on the stoop. Dr. Rochelle was returning to his lab and sees the woman. He has the nurse help him get the woman to his office. He removes her sunglasses and she opens her eyes. Like Johnson's they are milky white orbs.Johnson goes to pick up his car. The attendant (Tom Graeff) leads him to his car. Johnson directs him into the car, ""I must have a second live specimen."" A customer honks his horn for the attendant and the spell Johnson has over him is broken. The attendant bolts from Johnson's car. Johnson gives chase and kills him.Harry calls Nadine at Johnson's house. He tells her a woman died and that she had no eyes and wore the same sunglasses as Johnson. He tells her Johnson is dangerous and wants her to leave. Unwisely, Nadine ignores the advise and stays to do a little investigating with Jeremy. They search the house. They discover the communication device and the transporter in the closet. Jeremy discovers a skull in the furnace. Johnson arrives home. The phone rings and Nadine answers. She is unaware Johnson is home and picks up the downstairs phone and listens to her conversation with Dr. Rochelle about the Davanna woman. Johnson tells Nadine to remain in her room, and then hangs up the other phone. Johnson kills Jeremy then runs upstairs to kill Nadine. She won't look at him and employs a piercing scream to escape. Johnson is especially sensitive to loud noises. She bolts from the house. He gives chase in his car. Telepathically he tells her he is going to destroy Dr. Rochelle. He goes to the kitchen, removes a glass cylinder that Jeremy was examining days before. He reanimates a creature that resembles a cross between a crab and an umbrella.Dr. Rochelle is examining the blood sample while the umbrella creature seeks it prey. It makes a noise like a guinea pig. It enters Rochelle's office through an open window. It drops down and engulfs the doctor's head. The doctor briefly struggles, collapses on his lab bench and bleeds out.Johnson drives to Nadine, following her mind signal. Nadine calls Harry and tells him Johnson is after her. Johnson chases her in the car and on foot through a park. Harry and Simmons (Pat Flynn) try to find Johnson and Nadine on their motorcycles. Nadine tires and is finally controlled by Johnson. She is to be the next human specimen to be sent through the transporter. He tells her to return to the house and step into the beam and transport herself to Davanna. Johnson kills Simmons. Johnson targets Harry when he chases his car on the motorcycle. Harry uses his siren and causes Johnson to roll the car, breaking the spell on Nadine. She sobs while standing in the transporter.Harry and Nadine are standing next to a headstone. On it is written, ""Here lies a man who was not of this earth."" They exchange small talk at the graveside. We close with a lone figure of a man approaching, dressed like Johnson and wearing sunglasses."

tt0050798,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Family', 'Western']","Not long after the end of the Civil War, a young family settles in a community called Salt Licks, Texas. Jim Coates (Fess Parker), his wife Katie (Dorothy McGuire) and two sons, Travis (Tommy Kirk) and Arliss (Kevin Corcoran), have a pretty good start on things, but are lacking money, except some minor amounts of useless Confederate money. The same is true for most of the other families in the area. Jim joins up with other ranchers and they embark on a cattle drive to Kansas, to trail and sell their cattle and acquire money to buy things they need.Jim tells Travis he's depending on him to help his mother and look after the ranch while he's gone for the next 3-4 months. He promises to bring Travis the horse he wants when he returns from Kansas.Travis is plowing the cornfield with Jumper the mule when a big yellow dog barrels through the field while chasing a rabbit. Jumper is immediately spooked and takes off running, dragging Travis behind. Travis escapes from the plow harness, but the mule continues running, the plow knocking down a long section of fence in the process. Travis is furious with the dog, throwing rocks and threatening to shoot it if it comes around again.The younger boy, Arliss, regularly collects small animals and puts them in his pants pockets, much to the dismay of his mother. When Arliss hears about what happened with the strange yellow dog, he immediately wants to find and keep it. The next morning, the dog is lying outside the front door, and when Travis goes for a stick to use in chasing the dog off, Arliss is upset and is ready to fight his older brother in order to protect the dog. Arliss immediately adopts the dog and his mother approves, encouraging Travis to reconsider his feelings about having the dog around.Travis really wants nothing to do with the dog, but his feelings begin to change after he brings home a deer he shot and hangs the meat on the front porch, warning the yellow dog not to touch it or he'd pay the consequences. Travis then purposely lowers the meat so it will be easily within reach of the dog. The next morning, Travis grabs his gun in anticipation and goes out onto the porch, expecting the meat to be gone and thus providing a reason for him to shoot the dog. However, the meat is untouched and the yellow dog is lying quietly nearby. The dog's unexpected obedience impresses Travis enough to keep him.Arliss has taken to calling the dog ""Yeller."" He rides Yeller like a small horse, takes him fishing (Yeller catches a catfish), and they go swimming together in the family's spring water pool. One day, Arliss is breaking off small pieces of bread and tossing them to a small black bear cub. When the cub comes closer, Arliss jumps on it and tries to catch it. The cub cries out and within moments, the mother bear comes running, heading right for Arliss. Yeller flies into the picture and attacks the mother bear, keeping her at bay until Mrs. Coates rescues Arliss. Travis is further impressed with the dog's bravery and ability to protect them.Bud Searcy (Jeff York) and his daughter Elizabeth (Beverly Washburn) come by to check up on the Coates family. Bud is a lazy, big-mouthed sort who was left behind by the men of the community to look after the families while they were gone to Kansas. Bud's most redeeming points are his ability to show up around meal-time, get his daughter to do any work that needs done, and to tell exaggerated tales about his experiences and those of his family members. Elizabeth, who is about Travis age, confides in Travis that she has seen Yeller stealing eggs and cornbread from members of the community. She won't tell her father or anyone else however, because she knows Yeller is the father of the pups her dog is expecting and she doesn't think it would be nice to get the father of her dog's pups in trouble.Travis determines that one way to keep Yeller from roaming and getting in further trouble, is to put him on guard duty in the cornfield, where raccoons have been eating the corn. Yeller does a good job of chasing off the coons.The Coate's lone milk cow, Rose, goes off into the woods to birth her calf and Travis takes Yeller to go find them. The cow, being protective of her calf, attacks Travis and Yeller intervenes and actually knocks the cow down twice before she decides to stop chasing Travis. Travis carries the calf home while Yeller herds Rose back.Rose is still very upset, having been tied to a fence without her calf nearby. Travis must attempt to milk her, but she kicks at him. So, he calls to Yeller to come help. Yeller slowly walks towards Red, stopping a few feet away, staring at her. Because of their earlier encounter, Rose stops acting up and simply keeps an eye on Yeller. Mrs. Coates is amazed.Burn Sanderson, a rancher passing through from San Antonio, comes by the house and announces that he lost a big ol' yellow dog recently. He said the dog was an excellent cattle dog and he hoped to get him back, despite the dog's penchant for stealing food. Mrs. Coates tells Travis to go get Yeller. Travis doesn't want to, but he does as told. As Sanderson puts a rope around Yeller's neck and begins to ride away, Arliss picks up some rocks and throws them at Sanderson. Sanderson's horse is spooked and it bucks him off. Sanderson is a wise and kind person and he immediately realizes the impact Yeller has made on this family in the short time he's been there. He challenges Arliss to approach him, as though to deal with the matter man-to-man, but takes on a friendly tone and offers to trade the yellow dog for the horned frog that Arliss has in his pocket plus a ""woman-cooked meal."" Arliss happily agrees and his mother helps with the meal part of the deal.Before he leaves, Sanderson releases the horned frog and confides in Travis that there are cases of hydrophobia (rabies) showing up in the area. He advises him not to delay in quickly dispatching any unusually aggressive animals he may come across. He also tells him not to tell his mother about the epidemic, fearing it would scare her and Arliss.Bud Searcy tells Travis that he'd seen a herd of hogs with the Coates family mark wandering a short distance from their farm. Travis needs to mark the newborn hogs with the family mark so he takes Yeller with him to help herd them. Travis climbs onto a low hanging branch, has Yeller herd the hogs under the branch, lowering a rope noose to catch one pig at a time, pulling it up, notching it's ear, then continuing with the rest of the pigs. Travis and Yeller collaborate well and he successfully marks one small pig but then loops an adult and it pulls him out of the tree. A boar with sharp tusks then attacks Travis, cutting his leg. Yeller saves him, but in the process, Yeller is severely injured. Travis uses a neckerchief on his leg, then wraps his shirt around Yeller's torso wound and helps him into a small cave for protection and runs for home. Mrs. Coates returns with Travis, Arliss, and Jumper to see about Yeller. She sends Arliss off to catch a green lizard for her (to keep him busy), while she uses one of Jumper's tail hairs to sew up Yeller's wound. They then use a travois to haul Yeller home to recover.While Travis and Yeller are recovering, Mr. Searcy and Elizabeth come by. Elizabeth brings with her a small yellow puppy, one of Yeller's pups, and offers it to Travis. Travis says he's not interested and tells her to give it to Arliss. Elizabeth is very hurt and deposits the puppy in Arliss' lap as she rushes out, crying. Arliss is thrilled with the pup. When Searcy hears about Travis' and Yeller's battle with the hogs, he brings up the rabies epidemic.Some days later, the hydrophobia makes its presence known: Rose, the dairy cow, shows symptoms as she staggers around. Mrs. Coates somberly instructs Travis to shoot the cow some distance from the farm, so as not to spread the disease. However, while his mother and Elizabeth are putting wood on a large fire to burn the carcass, a wolf attacks them. Yeller is right on the spot and engages the wolf. Travis runs out with his rifle and when he has a clear shot, he shoots the wolf dead. Yeller has some bite marks and Mrs. Coates tells Travis that he will need to shoot Yeller too, because he's no doubt infected, as the wolf had been acting very strangely when it attacked. Travis convinces his mother to let him put Yeller in a pen and observe him.After nearly four weeks of being penned, Yeller does in fact turn mean and snarls and snaps, first at Travis then Arliss. Travis acknowledges the inevitable and goes to get his gun. He returns just in time to stop Arliss from opening the pen. After considerable difficulty, Travis points the gun at Yeller and pulls the trigger. The next day, Mr. Coates returns home, bearing gifts of a new dress and shoes for his wife, an Indian headdress and hatchet for Arliss, and a new horse for Travis. Travis and Elizabeth are in the process of burying Yeller. Travis is despondent and doesn't respond as his father hoped he would upon seeing him and the new horse. Mr. Coates fully understands the situation, however, and counsels his son.Mr. Coates tells Travis that life can sometimes knock a person flat and make them hurt bad. He says that people need to be careful that life's bad events don't overwhelm them and cause all life to seem bad. He explains that along with the bad in life, there's also good, and the good can be found if a person just looks for it. Travis is naturally skeptical, and probably disbelieving, but when he observes his mother getting angry at the little puppy for dragging off a slab of venison to chew on, he immediately recognizes Yeller's character exhibiting itself in the pup, and he smiles in recognition of what his father was talking about."
tt0050825,"['Drama', 'War']","A voice-over narrator explains that Germany and France entered World War I in August, 1914 and, with the construction of a continuous line of fortified trenches stretching from Switzerland to the English Channel, a costly military stalemate set in. By 1916, ""successful attacks were measured in thousands of yards and paid for by casualties in the hundreds of thousands.""General George Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), an elderly member of the French General Staff, arrives from Paris at the headquarters (a magnificent chateau) of his subordinate, General Paul Mireau (George Macready), to inform him that a major offensive is planned for General Mireau's sector and, in preparation for this offensive, General Broulard wants Mireau's division to capture a well-defended German position nicknamed the 'Anthill'. Mireau balks at the idea, claiming that his division is in no condition to defend the Anthill, much less capture it. Broulard reluctantly mentions that, in a completely unrelated matter, he was thinking that Mireau was due for a promotion, not that this should sway his decision concerning the feasibility of an attack on the Anthill. After explaining to Broulard at great length that the men he commands mean more to him than ""all the stars and decorations in France,"" the ambitious Mireau concludes that an attack on the Anthill just might work.Mireau undertakes an inspection of the front line trenches with his loyal and cynical staff officer, Major Saint-Auban (Richard Anderson). The general stops to ask several soldiers (who later become major characters) the question, ""Ready to kill more Germans?"" When one soldier (Fred Bell) fails to answer, merely staring straight ahead, his comrades reply that the soldier is suffering from shell shock. Mireau says there is no such thing as shell shock. When the general enquires about whether the soldier has a wife, the soldier replies that he'll never see her again since he's certain to be killed, to which Mireau scolds the soldier for acting like a coward. When the soldier replies that he is a coward, Mireau flies into a rage and strikes the soldier across the face, yelling that he wants this ""little baby"" transferred out of the regiment. As they continue through the trenches, Maj. Saint-Auban says that the general was right to do what he did and adds that he thinks that the high morale of the 701st Regiment is the direct result of the general's inspections, which Mireau denies, saying that their fighting spirit was just born in them.The commander of the 701st Regiment, Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), is greeted in his headquarters bunker by Mireau. When Maj. Saint-Auban makes a disparaging remark about the enlisted men, Dax takes offense and Mireau asks the major to leave them alone to discuss the coming assault. Dax is informed by Mireau of his plan to launch an attack on the Anthill, for which Dax shows little enthusiasm. Mireau criticizes Dax's lack of enthusiasm and threatens to have him relieved of command if he does not agree to his plan. Not wishing to be ""taken away from my men,"" the colonel reluctantly agrees that the 701st Regiment will (attempt to) take the Anthill.That night, a patrol is ordered to be sent out to reconnoiter no-man's land, the space between the opposing trenches. Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker) is among the two men chosen to accompany the half-drunk Lieutenant Roget (Wayne Morris) on this patrol. Cpl. Paris' fellow soldier remarks that the corporal doesn't seem to like the lieutenant, to which Cpl. Paris replies that he knew Roget before the war and didn't have much respect for him then either. Lt. Roget, having sought to bolster his courage with alcohol, leads the patrol through the barbed wire, water-filled shell holes, and general wreckage that is no-man's land. When they come to a halt, Lt. Roget orders the third member of the patrol to scout forward on his own, against the objections of Cpl. Paris. As they wait for the third soldier to return, Lt. Roget becomes increasingly nervous, saying he must have been killed. Finally, in a panic, Lt. Roget throws a grenade into the darkness and runs back to the French lines, leaving Cpl. Paris behind. Cpl. Paris, crawling forward, discovers the third soldier lying in a shell hole, having been killed by Lt. Roget's grenade.A little later, when Cpl. Paris shows up at Lt. Roget's command bunker, the lieutenant acts as if he's happy to see that the corporal is still alive. But Cpl. Paris confronts him with his crimes: drunk on duty, cowardice in the face of the enemy, killing a fellow soldier, etc. Lt. Roget pretends to be sorry and points out that a court of inquiry is more likely to believe the word of a lieutenant than that of a corporal, so Paris might as well forget it all happened. At that moment Col. Dax arrives to pick up the report on the patrol, but Lt. Roget states that it isn't finished yet. Dax clearly sees there's something going on between Roget and Paris, but doesn't pursue the matter.Dax has a final meeting with his officers to explain how the attack on the following day will proceed. One officer asks what the weather is supposed to be like, to which the colonel replies ""Too good"" -- meaning no rain or fog to provide cover for the troops advancing across no-man's land. Another officer asks how long they will have to hold the Anthill once they've captured it. Dax replies that they will have to hold it (against enemy counterattacks) for the entire day. While the officers discuss the details of the assault, the enlisted men consider what they will face in the morning. Conversing in whispers with another soldier, Private Arnaud (Joseph Turkel) considers what his fellow soldiers are most afraid of: poison gas, high explosive shells, a bayonet in the gut... He points out that what everyone is afraid of is pain, not death, since everyone knows that he's going to die some day. His comrade, rolling over to get some sleep, replies ""You're too smart for me, professor. All I know is, nobody wants to die.""The following morning Mireau, accompanied by his ever faithful lackey Maj. Saint-Auban, stands in an observation post waiting for the attack to commence. He offers his fellow officers a drink and they respectfully decline, leaving the general to toast the success of the assault on his own.In the trenches, Dax is walking past the men of the 701st Regiment who are pressed up against the sides for cover against the artillery barrage, which is intended to screen the men as they advance towards the enemy (this was known as a 'creeping barrage'). The shells roar overhead and many fall perilously close, showering Dax and his men with clods of dirt and waves of dust. (In his initial discussion with Dax about the assault, Mireau included a figure for the likely percentage of men who would be killed by their own barrage when calculating the possible casualties. This was, in fact, an unavoidable reality in the First World War.) A whistle between his teeth and a revolver in his hand, Dax climbs a ladder as Sergeant Boulanger (Bert Freed), staring at his wristwatch, counts down ""...three, two, one, zero!"" As Dax blows his whistle and waves his men to ""go over the top,"" a mass of French soldiers emerges from the trenches into the open of no-man's land. Carrying heavy packs, with their bayonets fixed, the men move forward as fast as possible, over torn remnants of barbed wire, down into and up out of shell craters, seemingly an inexorable wave. But shells burst amongst them and enemy machine gun fire can be heard. The men go down, a soldier here, another there, and more and more fall, individually and in heaps. Others behind them step over the bodies, only to drop and add to the piles. In the deafening confusion, covered in mud, Dax asks a sergeant next to him where 'B' Company is, to which the sergeant replies he doesn't know.Mireau in his observation post also notices the failure of 'B' Company to advance. The general flies into a rage and orders his artillery to commence shelling the trenches occupied by the troops of 'B' Company in order to force them to advance (if only to escape from the shelling). The Battery Commander, Captain Rousseau (John Stein) refuses to comply with Mireau's order. ""Sir, you have no right to order me to shoot down my own men without an order in writing and signed by the general. What if you're killed, then where will I be?"" The psychopath Mireau replies: ""You'll be in front of a firing squad, that's where you'll be! Hand over your command and place yourself under arrest for an immediate court-martial!""Meanwhile, Dax, racing through the wreckage of his trenches, reaches Lt. Roget and 'B' Company. The drunk Roget pleads with Dax that they've already tried twice and taken far too many casualties. Ignoring him, Dax climbs a ladder while blowing his whistle, trying to encourage the men to ""give it another try,"" only to have a dead soldier falling from above knock him off the ladder. Around them, all the soldiers are falling back to their trenches. Mireau is informed in his observation post that the attack has failed all along the line. He instructs Major Saint-Auban to have the 701st Regiment pulled out of the line and to assemble a general court-martial. ""If those little sweethearts won't face German bullets, they'll face French ones!""The following day, Dax meets with Broulard and Mireau at headquarters, where the cynical Mireau accuses the entire 701st Regiment of cowardice and proposes to have 100 men from the regiment randomly executed. Dax strongly objects and Broulard intervenes to break up their argument. Broulard says they don't want to slaughter the French Army, they just want to set an example, to which Dax replies that if it's an example that's needed, the logical choice is the officer most responsible for the attack. (Implying, of course, that if anyone should face a firing squad, it should be the scumbag General Mireau.) Broulard loses his temper and shouts, ""This is not a question of officers!"" Regaining his composure, Broulard suggests that one man from each of the regiment's three companies should be chosen to be tried for cowardice in the face of the enemy. Although he initially objects, Mireau accepts Broulard's proposal. Before they leave, Dax requests to be appointed defense attorney for the accused men and Broulard agrees, chiding Mireau for ""hiding"" Dax, an obviously talented officer, from him. (Earlier in the film it's established that Dax was one of France's top attorneys before the war.) Outside in the hallway, Mireau confronts Dax and virtually orders him to step down as the defense attorney, but the colonel refuses. Mireau rails against him for his apparent disloyalty and promises to ruin his career when this is over. When Mireau catches up with Broulard, they are met by the Battery Commander, Captain Rousseau, who says that Mireau had ordered him to meet with the general. Thinking fast, Mireau lies and says that he wanted to speak to the captain about some of his shells falling short and dismisses him. Broulard recommends a public hearing, the last thing Mireau wants, but Mireau talks Broulard out of it and the matter is forgotten.Dax meets with the three accused men. They include the intellectual Private Arnaud, who was randomly picked by lot; Cpl. Paris, who Lt. Roget chose because he knows what Roget did during the patrol in no-man's land the night before the battle; and Private Ferol (Timothy Carey), who was chosen because his Company Commander considered him to be a ""social degenerate."" Dax explains that the reason they were chosen is irrelevant, since they are all charged with cowardice. He explains that he doesn't have much time (the trial is that afternoon) and he needs to prepare. Dax urges them to show the same courage that they have shown in the face of the enemy.At the chateau, Arnaud, Paris, and Ferol sit in chairs in front of a group of officers behind tables in a large room. The officer serving as the chief judge of the Court Martial (Peter Capell) begins the proceedings by calling one of the men to testify, but Dax immediately objects, pointing out that the men have the right to hear the charges against them read out. The officer serving as the chief judge replies that the court does not wish to waste time with technicalities and that basically the charges are that these three men showed cowardice in the face of the enemy during the attack on the Anthill. Having been appointed (by Mireau) as the prosecutor, Maj. Saint-Auban grills each of the three men in turn, with Dax cross-examining them to show that they are not cowards, all to little avail. The entire trial is a farce. Dax sees his men's rights violated by the cynical military judges (who are clearly acting under the orders of Mireau, sitting nearby). Dax is barred from entering any evidence relating to the case.In his closing argument to the judges, Saint-Auban asserts that the actions of the 701st Regiment during the attack on the Anthill were a stain on the honor of France and, as such, asks the court to find these men guilty and impose the penalty of death to make an example of them. Afterwards, Dax protests in his summation about the nature of the trial. Mireau speaks up, asking Dax if he questions the legitimacy of the court, to which Dax replies that he objects to the fact that he was given practically no time to prepare his case, no written indictment was ever made against the accused, that he was prevented from introducing evidence that would have been vital for the defense, that the prosecution presented no witnesses to back up their claims, and on top of all that, that no stenographic records of the trial were being kept. He says that the attack by the 701st Regiment on the Antihill was no stain on the honor of France, but this trial is such a stain. He warns the officers serving as judges: ""Gentlemen of the court, to find these men guilty would be a crime to haunt each of you till the day you die,"" and pleads for mercy. The judges adjourn to deliberate.The next day, Sgt. Boulanger is placed in charge of the guards for the prisoners. He strides up and down the line of men under his command, explaining the regulations and pointing out that he has been made personally responsible for anything that happens involving these prisoners, but that he will ensure that, if there are any mistakes, he will pass on any punishment with interest to the men under his command.Inside the stable in which they are being held, Arnaud, Paris, and Ferol consider their options. Ferol thinks he's going to get out of it somehow. Paris is worried what his wife will think. Eyeing a cockroach on the table, Paris ruminates over the fact that if he's executed the cockroach will have more contact with his wife and children than he will, it will be alive, while he'll be dead. Ferol slams his hand down on the table and mutters, ""Now you've got the edge on him."" Dinner is brought in to the men. Ferol is suspicious that the food is drugged to make them groggy. Arnaud thinks Ferol is being stupid, but Ferol refuses to eat anyway. Finally a priest (Emile Meyer) arrives with news of the verdict; they've all been found guilty and will be executed in the morning. Ferol breaks down and the priest tries to comfort him. The priest asks Paris if he would like to make his confession, but Paris says that he's not a religious man and that if he began praying now, he would feel like a hypocrite. The priest tells him that that would be an error and promises him that God is there for him and that death comes to us all. Arnaud, being eaten alive by the injustice of their situation, doesn't take this well and mocks the priest, holding up a bottle of wine he is drinking and pretends to pray to it. The priest says that he is there to help them, but Arnaud replies that back in his home town there was a cafe with an amusing sign above the bar that read, ""Do not be Afraid to Ask for Credit, for Our way of Refusing is very Polite."" Arnaud becomes increasingly angry, while Paris tries to restrain him, but he breaks free and punches the priest. Paris then gets between them and warns Arnaud not to try anything, but Arnaud lunges forward and Paris is forced to slug him. Arnaud stumbles backwards, hitting his head on a stone column and a doctor is summoned. Having patched him up as best he could, the doctor remarks that Arnaud has a very serious skull fracture and he may not live through the night. The priest asks whether they intend to execute a man in this condition, but the doctor informs him that the death sentence will be carried out and recommends pinching his cheek to wake him up in the morning if he still alive, since Mireau wants him to be conscious when he's executed.That same night, Lt. Roget arrives at Dax's quarters, asking what the colonel wanted to see him about. Dax asks Roget why he chose Cpl. Paris to be court-martialed, saying that, of course the lieutenant had no personal motives for picking Paris. Visibly nervous, Roget replies that of course he had no personal reasons for choosing Paris, it was just that someone had to be chosen. Dax explains that he has the same problem, he has to find someone to be in charge of the firing squad and asks Lt. Roget if he would like the assignment. Taken aback, Roget protests by telling Dax he has never overseen an execution before. Dax explains that it is a simple matter: the two primary responsibilities are to offer the men a blindfold and to put a bullet in each man's head after the firing squad has finished. Despite additional protests by Roget, Dax dismisses him curtly from his quarters, telling him he's got the job. As Roget is leaving, the Battery Commander, Captain Rousseau, enters and tells the colonel that he has some information that may have an important bearing on the courts martial.Broulard is attending a lavish ball for general officers and other dignitaries when he is called away to the library, where he privately meets Colonel Dax. Dax confesses that his is not entirely a social visit, and the general protests that he doesn't want to go back over the whole affair, though he admits that, judging from the casualty reports, the 701st Regiment did make a serious effort. Dax asks him why, if that is true, the three men should be executed. Broulard says perhaps the attack was doomed to fail, but, on the other hand, with a little more effort, the 701st might have captured the Anthill. Broulard then gently accuses Dax of taking a narrow view of things, reminding him that the general staff is subjected to all sorts of unfair pressures from the press and politicians. Moreover, there's the matter of the troops' morale. ""You see, colonel, troops are like children, and just as a child wants his father to be firm, troops crave discipline, and one way to ensure discipline is to shoot a man now and again."" Dax asks the general, ""Do you sincerely believe the things you've just said?"" Broulard, making a tactical retreat, excuses himself to return to the party, but as they walk towards the door Dax brings up the subject of Mireau's order for his artillery to fire on his own troops during the attack. Broulard immediately slams the door to the library shut and turns around to face Dax while he continues to describe what happened. The general asks Dax if he expects him to believe something so fantastic. Dax produces the signed statements of Battery Commander Rousseau, the telephone operator, and his own observations, asking the general what the press and politicians would do with such material should it ever be made public. Losing his temper, Broulard shouts ""Are you trying to blackmail me?!"" Dax calmly explains that ""too much has happened and someone has to take the blame. The question is who? A general launches an impossible attack and, on the same day, orders his artillery to fire on his own men. But when that same general tries to have three innocent men executed, those men are saved by the intervention of the general staff."" Broulard pauses for a moment with the documents in his hand. Looking up at Dax, ""If you'll excuse me colonel. I've been rude to my guests for too long."" Broulard exits the room, leaving Dax alone.At dawn the next morning, Sgt. Boulanger opens the door to the stable to announce that it's time to leave. Cpl. Paris, struggling to act normal, tells the sergeant that he missed some great food the previous night. When the sergeant asks what they had, Paris can't answer, but asks if the sergeant has anything to drink. The sergeant hands him a canteen and tells him to take a swig. Paris begins to laugh, telling the sergeant that remarkably he hasn't had one sexual thought since the court martial and then crumbles to the ground weeping. The sergeant tells Paris to pull himself together, but Paris, sobbing, asks why he has to die. The sergeant reminds him that many of his comrades are likely to die in the near future in combat, but Paris, still sobbing, says he doesn't care, he still doesn't want to die. Finally, Sgt. Boulanger tells Paris that they have to go and that there are reporters present; how does he want to be remembered by his wife and children? Either he can walk out or be dragged out, in the end it's the same. Cpl. Paris collects himself, stands up and puts on his cap.With the rolling sound of drums in the background, the men of the 701st Regiment, standing at attention, are lined up on both sides of a path in a huge courtyard in front of a chateau on a beautiful sunny morning. The three condemned men slowly make their way down the path: Paris marching upright, staring straight ahead, Arnaud, unconscious and strapped to a stretcher, is carried along, and Ferol, completely unhinged, sobbing uncontrollably, has his arm around the priest who is accompanying him. They pass row upon row of soldiers; they pass the Regimental Band, drums still rolling; they pass a press photographer who takes their picture; they pass Broulard and Mireau, and they pass Dax. Finally they reach the posts they will be tied to in front of a wall of sandbags. Off to the side is a flatbed wagon with three coffins on it. The drums stop. The only noise is the sound of the firing squad's boots on the loose gravel as they march into position, with the cowardly Lt. Roget in command. Roget walks forward with blindfolds. Arnaud's stretcher is tilted up against the pole and the Sergeant pinches his cheek. In a groggy state, Arnaud looks with horror at the scene and appears to pass out once more. Skipping Arnaud, Roget offers Ferol a blindfold and, still crying, he accepts. Roget then comes over to Paris and asks if he wants a blindfold. Paris angrily says ""no"". Roget meekly says he's sorry for what he's done to him. Paris doesn't speak, but nods his head, implying that he accepts Roget's apology. Roget marches back to the firing squad, while Major Saint-Auban comes forward and, in a weak and halting voice (in complete contrast to his performance as the evil and cynical prosecutor) he reads out loud the orders for the execution. For a moment the only sounds are the chirping of the birds on a sunny morning. Lt. Roget shouts out: ""Ready, aim, fire!""A little later in the ch√¢teau over breakfast, Mireau expresses his pleasure that the executions went so well, that none of the condemned men spoiled it by doing something that would leave a bad taste in everyone's mouth. ""It had a certain splendor about it."" Broulard, choosing his words carefully, notes that he has never seen an affair of this kind carried out so well. When Dax arrives, the gloating Mireau compliments him on his men dying well. Angry and disgusted, Dax says nothing. Suddenly, and to Dax's surprise, Broulard mentions to Mireau that the colonel had come to him the night before claiming that during the attack on the Anthill, Mireau had ordered his artillery to fire on his own men. Mireau flatly denies the allegation, but Dax states that he has signed testimony from numerous witnesses. Broulard says that it doesn't matter for he's certain that the general will come through it. ""Come through what?"" asks Mireau with concern. ""There will have to be an investigation. An inquiry,"" but, Broulard notes, ""the public will forget."" Horrified, General Mireau stands up and shouts: ""So I'm the scapegoat, the only completely innocent man in this whole affair!"" Aware that his military career days are numbered, Mireau storms out of the room, claiming himself to be a true soldier.After Mireau leaves, Broulard comments that France's armies and military destiny cannot be guided by arrogant fools like General Mireau and then, turning to Dax, asks: ""How would you like to have General Mireau's job?"" Dax is again taken completely by surprise, and replies ""You're offering me General Mireau's command?"" The elderly general responds ""Come come, my boy, we all know you've been after it from the start."" Dax responds angrily: ""I am a lot of things, but I am not your boy."" Broulard sternly tells Dax not to get defensive around him, but with Mireau's days in the French Army numbered and aware that he will be forced to resign his command regardless of the inquiry to be brought on him, his command needs a replacement and Broulard assumes that Dax will do just right and it would be a shame for Dax to lose the promotion before it is ever given to him. Dax replies: ""General, would you like me to suggest what you can do with that promotion?"" Broulard becomes furious with Dax and shouts: ""Colonel Dax, you shall apologize at once or I will have you placed under arrest!"" Speaking in a subtle tone that quickly turns into anger Dax replies: ""I apologize.... for not being completely honest. I apologize for not showing my true feelings. I apologize for not telling you sooner that you're a sick, degenerate, heartless, sadistic old man. And you can go to hell before I apologize to you now or ever again!""Briefly stunned by Dax's furious and defiant outburst, Broulard slumps back and sighs, now realizing that he was wrong about Dax. In a calm tone, Broulard shakes his head and responds by saying: ""Colonel Dax, you are a disappointment to me. You've spoiled the keenness of your mind by wallowing in sentimentality. You really did want to save those three men... and you were not angling for General Mireau's command."" The impassive and unfeeling Broulard then ridicules Dax by adding: ""You're not a soldier. You're an idealist. For that I pity you as I would the village idiot. We're fighting a war, Dax. A war we've got to win. Those men wouldn't fight, so I had them shot; you brought charges against Mireau, so I demanded that he answer to them. Wherein have I done wrong?"" Dax replies, ""You really don't know the answer to that. I pity you for that."" Dax leaves.Now outside, Dax wanders over to a tavern where he hears men from his regiment having a good time. (It's not clear if these are merely troops from the 701st or, perhaps, the men from the firing squad.) The proprietor (Jerry Hausner) brings a young German woman (Susanne Christaina), who is clearly frightened, on stage to entertain the troops. The men hoot and whistle and jeer; ""Talk in a civilized language!"" one yells out. Dax, standing outside, cringes in disgust, seeming to reflect his general disillusionment with not only generals Mireau and Broulard, but the entire human race. But as the girl begins to sing the German folk song, ""The Faithful Hussar"", the catcalls and whistles gradually die down and the men, captivated by the only decent, innocent being they've come in contact with for a very long time, begin to hum along; some of them even begin to shed tears.Outside the tavern, Sgt. Boulanger appears before Dax with word that the 701st Regiment has been ordered to return to the front. Dax, his faith in common humanity restored, tells the sergeant to give the men a few minutes more, and walks away to his office as his smile turns into a hardened look once again.THE END"

He's delirious, grabs the steering wheel, and tries to run the car off the road. They enter a ""T"" intersection and nearly crash into the car Professor Bernard Quatermass (Brian Dunlevy) is driving. Quatermass gets out of his car and walks over to the other. He's very angry and shaken, but inquires about the burn on the man's face. The woman hands him some rock fragments and tells him they were responsible for the burn. She tells him they were in Winterton Flats for a picnic. Quatermass helps push the car back onto the road, when Chris bolts from the car. They wrestle him back into the car. Credits roll. (Note: The British Version is called Quatermass 2, while the American version of this movie was titled Enemy from Space.)At the Rocket project we see a building with a radar antenna mounted on the roof. Two operators are watching the screen. They notice scores of objects coming down slowly. They track the objects to one hundred miles north of their location. As they reset the equipment, Quatermass drives up. He notices the antenna setting and is very annoyed. He scolds Brand (William Franklyn) and Marsh (Bryan Forbes) for what he perceives as unauthorized use of the scanner.He tells Marsh and Brand that tomorrow none of them may have jobs. He gives Marsh the stone fragments and tells him to have them analyzed and classified. He apologizes to Brand and tells him that the moon project is to be cancelled. He outlines the project scope in front of a scale model--to build a colony on the moon. As he prepares to get in his car he points to the rocket ship on the launch pad and tells Brand, ""Can you still bear to look at it? The sum total of our achievement up to now--one Rocket, crewless, untried."" He leaves for the rocket launch area. Brand returns to the radar room and notices more traces on the screen.It is morning and the office is a buzz of activity. Quatermass enters, awake all night, and Marsh is waiting for him. He wants to report on the meteorite. Brand is holding the reconstructed fragments and notes that it is hollow and symmetric. Quatermass tells Marsh to get the car ready. He and Marsh drive up to Winterton Flats to have a look at the place themselves. They encounter a new road, marked ""Road Closed, Government Property."" Ignoring the sign they drive until the road ends and they get out of the car to investigate. Quatermass warns Marsh not to walk any further. They get back in the car and drive back and take another fork in the road. That takes them to a section of road on a plateau. They see a demolished town below and their moon project fully built. They walk down to get a better look. They notice the area littered with more rock fragments, some broken, others nearly whole. They hear an alarm horn and Quatermass asks, ""I wonder if that's meant for us? Perhaps we better go and explain ourselves."" Marsh digs up a whole object. He picks it up and hears a whoosh of air, and smoke billows from the object. Marsh coughs and collapses to the ground. Quatermass notices something on his face. A large blister and a V shaped scar on his cheek. A truck of soldiers leaves the installation. Quatermass helps Marsh to his feet as a dozen or more soldiers surrounds them. A couple of soldiers grab Marsh. They refuse to respond to questions asked by Quatermass. He notices one soldier with the same V shaped mark on his face. They escort Quatermass back to his car after hitting him in the face with a rifle butt. They tell him, ""Go, go now."" Quatermass drives into a local town to report to the police, but the little town has no police, only a camp committee in the Community Center. He talks to the camp secretary, Dawson (Charles Lloyd Pack). When he asks about the installation he is met with hostility and suspicion. They refuse to allow him to use the phone. Quatermass drives to the nearby town of Brawley. The police there tell him he was not supposed to be trespassing at the installation. They will not tell him anything about the facility. Quatermass drives back to the rocket center. Brand tells him more meteorites have fallen. Quatermass immediately orders the rocket center guarded. He tells Brand the stones are a container of some type. In addition to ammonia gas, they harbor something alien and alive. He also tells Brand that the moon project has already been built at Winterton Flats. Quatermass will go to London in the morning. His staff has reconstructed the container before it entered the atmosphere. They conclude its aerodynamic shape is the sign of intelligence.Driving to London, Quatermass notices large trucks moving equipment with the same strange logo he saw on the road signs. He stops at Scotland Yard to talk to Inspector Lomax (John Longden). Lomax wants to engage in small talk, but Quatermass gets straight to the point. He asks, ""Just how much do you know about a place called Winterton Flats?"" Lomax seems stunned. He tells him the place is Top Secret. Quatermass tells Lomax his story. Lomax finally admits a tidbit, ""Well that place should be harmless enough. It's a government project to make synthetic food."" Lomax then gets on the phone and arranges a meeting for Quatermass with a Member of Parliament, one Vincent Broadhead. They are to meet in an hour.Quatermass tells Vincent Broadhead (Tom Chatto) about his trip to the site. Broadhead thinks the project is just a waste of money, but he wants details and tells Quatermass it started to scale up about two years before. Broadhead tells him he just got a pass to visit the installation. He meets with the P.R. officer (John Van Eyssen) and gets Quatermass added to the pass. They have lunch then board cars for the trip to Winterton Flats.They enter the plant. It resembles a huge oil refinery (Shell Haven Refinery in Essex). Quatermass pulls Broadhead aside when he spots the Medical Centre Building. He is looking for his colleague, Marsh, and asks if he wants to join him in having a look inside. The P.R. guide notices Quatermass and Broadhead missing from the tour and searches for them. The two men enter the medical building and are met by a very rude doctor and an empty hospital. There are no patients and very little staff. The guide finds them and gets them back with the inspection team. Quatermass notices a large container marked Ammonia. Their next stop on the tour is one of the large containment domes. Three men inside the dome don gas masks as the inspection party is hustled along the tour. The guide notices that Broadhead is missing. He tries to seal the door on the tour group, but Quatermass escapes and gets back outside. Quatermass runs back to a steel sphere he noticed earlier. Broadhead exits the top of the structure and stumbles down a ladder screaming and coughing. He is covered in a corrosive black slime that burns. He warns Quatermass not to touch him. The material has blinded him and eventually kills him. An alarm horn goes off and Quatermass runs back to the car. Guards with machine guns fire at him. He commandeers one of the cars and escapes the facility.At Scotland Yard, a very drunk Jimmy Hall (Sid James) stops by for any news he can print in the newspaper. He needs to fill one and one-half columns before midnight. Quatermass stops by to see Lomax. Hall accosts him at the front desk. Lomax is preparing to leave the office. Quatermass briefs Lomax on the goings on at the plant. He tells Lomax that Broadhead is dead. Lomax shows him a newspaper story that Broadhead is away on a ""Trade Mission."" Quatermass demands an investigation. Lomax goes to talk to the Commissioner (John Stuart) but before he can relate the story he notices the mark on the man's hand. He makes up a story and exits. He returns to Quatermass and asks about the mark. He describes it perfectly. They now know that many government and police officials are being systematically infected to protect the project. Brand calls Quatermass at Scotland Yard and tells him they've found the source of the containers. Jimmy Hall barges into Lomax's office and Quatermass and Lomax decide that a news report may be the best solution.At the Rocket Center Quatermass and Lomax show Hall the evidence. He tells him that the alien intelligence is a piece of a larger organism. They infect a human host then, ""an immediate invasion of his entire nervous system. Something is implanted, an instinct, a blind compulsion to act for them."" Hall is incredulous. He wants more information and wants to see Winterton Flats. Before they leave Quatermass briefs Brand on his contingency plans. He also gets a preliminary report on the black slime. He tells Hall and Lomax that it is a deadly poison to every living thing on earth. Quatermass thinks it is food for the life in the domes.There is a St. Patricks Day dance at the Rec Center. Ernie, the bartender (Michael Ripper) and Sheila (Vera Day) are busy behind the bar with drink orders. Sheila is horrified by the drunken ""jig"" Paddy Gorman (Percy Herbert) is performing. She pushes him aside, dances, and wins the competition. Hall shows up, along with Quatermass and Lomax, and asks Sheila about work at the plant. The camp secretary recognizes Quatermass and tries to throw the three out. Then the crowd tries to throw them out but Lomax identifies himself as a police officer and tells the crowd they are in danger. A container falls through the roof. They empty the room while Sheila picks the meteorite up and is infected. Against strong advise from Quatermass, Hall calls in his story from the Rec Center. The guards show up and kill Hall while he's on the phone. Quatermass and Lomax get in the car and are fired upon as they depart. They head for the facility. Quatermass hits and kills a guard on the road with his car. They stop and find a truck with steel containers containing alien creatures. He notes that this is how they get them back to the domes. Quatermass sends Lomax back to London, while he impersonates the dead guard to gain entrance to the facility.A mob of townsfolk walk to the plant. They stop Lomax from getting back to London. They steal his car and head for the gate. Quatermass arrives at one of the dome processing areas. He looks into the dome through an inspection port and is mesmerized at the sight of the alien creature. It is huge. It looks like a multi-eyed, dark writhing carpet. His fellow workers suspect he isn't one of them, but before they can act, a general alarm is called to an emergency at Gate 4. The mob approaches the gate. The mob attacks one of the container retrieval trucks. The guards retaliate with gun fire. They are told over the loudspeaker to shoot to kill. They fight their way into the main pressure control blockhouse, where Quatermass was waiting for them. He identifies himself. Dawson, the camp secretary, panics and wants out. Quatermass examines the controls and notes the gases being used: Ammonia, Methane, Hydrogen and Oxygen. He also examines the piping layout. He speculates that the oxygen is being used to acclimatize the aliens to the earth's atmosphere. He shuts off all gases to the domes except Oxygen. That gets an immediate response. Quatermass confides in Lomax that the contingency plan is to use the rocket ship as an atomic bomb to hit the orbiting asteroid--the source of the containers and the aliens. Launch at midnight is the plan. Brand and Peterson (Edwin Richfield) make preparations at the launch center. As they are setting the systems, Marsh arrives with a contingent of guards to stop the launch. Brand is shot but launches the rocket. With his dying strength he arms the rocket for detonation.At the blockhouse, the mob has armed themselves with anti-tank weapons. Quatermass is happy to see his rocket was launched. The plant supervisors try to bargain with the control room mob. McLeod (John Rae) talks to one on the phone and arranges to see inside the dome. He, Dawson, and a third man leave and walk to one of the domes. Shortly thereafter there is a scream that reverberates through the oxygen pipe. Then blood starts dripping out of the oxygen supply pipe. They used the men as a plug to stop the flow. Angry, Ernie and Paddy begin firing at the dome and manage to blow one up. A toxic gas wafts towards the control room. The alien creature emerges from the remains of the damaged structure. It writhes around and attacks the control room, pushing in a wall. The remaining group consisting of Quatermass, Lomax, Ernie and Paddy escape. Amid the confusion of the humans, and the destruction to the plant by the alien forms they commandeer a jeep and escape the plant. Some distance from the plant they look back at three creatures writhing in pain exposed to the earth's atmosphere. The rocket hits its target in space and explodes lighting up the night sky like daytime. The creatures fall over and die amid the burning wreckage of the plant. A huge wind gust blows over their jeep. They take shelter behind it. An infected guard they took as proof of the infection now shows no sign of the mark. We end with Lomax asking, ""How am I going to make a final report about all this?"" Quatermass responds, ""What worries me is how final can it be?"" They walk down the road, and the cast credits roll."
tt0050882,"['Drama', 'Romance', 'War', 'Western']","In the town of Freehaven in Raintree County, Indiana, the high school class of 1859 poses for a photograph. Everyone expects great things of valedictorian John Wickliff Shawnessy (Montgomery Clift), in particular his sweetheart, Nell Gaither (Eva Marie Saint), who admires Johnny for his idealism, poetry and respect for truth and justice. Before graduation, Prof. Jerusalem Webster Stiles (Nigel Patrick), who smilingly describes himself as ""pitiful and harmless,"" relates to his students a local legend: Raintree County is named for a golden rain-tree, which was planted somewhere in the region by Johnny Appleseed. ""Find it, declares the professor in an unusually pensive mood, and you will learn the secret of life itself."" Johnny immediately sets out to locate the tree, but as he wanders through a swamp, he nearly drowns.Back in town, Orville ""Flash"" Perkins (Lee Marvin) boasts that, in addition to being ""half horse, half alligator,"" he is the area's top runner. Johnny challenges him to a race, and on the Fourth of July, the two competitors meet in the street. Before the race, the men engage in a drinking contest, and although Johnny, who has never before drunk whiskey, is rendered nearly senseless, he nonetheless wins the race. Later that day, Johnny goes to the river for a picnic with the professor, an attractive married woman named Lydia Gray, and a beautiful visitor from the South named Susanna Drake (Elizabeth Taylor). Johnny and Susanna go swimming, and then, in a moment of passion, make love.The next day, Susanna returns to New Orleans, and Johnny returns to Nell. When Stiles tries to run away with Lydia, her outraged husband Ezra tries to shoot him, but after Stiles swears that he never touched Lydia, Johnny helps the professor to leave town. The same train that carries Stiles to safety, however, brings Susanna back to Freehaven with a desperate message for Johnny: She is pregnant. Johnny announces their marriage, whereupon his father, T. D. Shawnessy (Walter Abel), a gentle and educated minister, somewhat sadly wishes the young man happiness. Nell also wishes him well but tearfully confesses that she still loves him.On the boat trip to New Orleans, Susanna is shocked to discover that Johnny is an abolitionist and nervously proclaims that nothing is worse than having a drop of Negro blood in one's veins. The couple visits the ruins of a family plantation that burned when Susanna was a child. Acting strangely, Susanna sorrowfully declares that she dearly loved her former nanny, a black Cuban named Henrietta Courtney, who perished with the girl's parents in the conflagration. Johnny questions Susanna's cousin and learns that after her parents were married, her mother went slowly insane. Her father met Henrietta and brought her home to care for little Susanna. When the bodies were taken from the fire, it appeared that the child's father and Henrietta had been shot, but no one was able to prove this.Johnny brings Susanna back to Raintree County, where he becomes a teacher. Susanna admits that she was never really pregnant, but Johnny assures her of his love nonetheless. When Lincoln wins the 1860 presidential election, Susanna announces that to please her husband, she has freed her two slaves and now pays them wages. This prompts several of their guests to laugh, and Susanna, believing she has again displeased her husband, becomes hysterical. Johnny calms her, but later, after giving birth to a son on the very day that Civil War is declared (April 12, 1861), Susanna informs him that two babies were born, and that ""they"" threw the dark one away.One year later, Nell returns to Freehaven after living for a time in Indianapolis, and it is clear that she still loves Johnny. Susanna's nightmares and wild-eyed outbursts have become more frequent, and one evening, Johnny persuades her to tell him about the fire: Jealous of Susanna's love for Henrietta, the child's mother had flown into a rage, thereby angering the little girl. When Susanna realized that her father also loved Henrietta, she vengefully revealed this in an anonymous note to her mother. That night, she heard a crackling sound in Henrietta's room, and soon afterward, the fire consumed the house. Believing her mother had killed the lovers because of her note, Susanna had always felt responsible for the tragedy. Johnny tries to comfort Susanna, but one day, he arrives home to find that she has taken their son Jim and fled to Georgia.With his wife gone, Johnny joins the Union Army, and as his train departs, Nell confesses that she has never stopped loving him. Johnny joins an Indiana brigade that includes not only Flash, but his old friend Stiles, who is now a war correspondent. The men participate in a number of hellish battles, and in November 1864, find themselves in Atlanta. Wary of rebel snipers, Johnny and Flash approach an old cabin that once belonged to Henrietta. Inside are little Jim and two Drake slaves. One of them explains that although Susanna was not Henrietta's child, she always believed that she was. Consumed by madness, Susanna had been taken to an asylum some time earlier. Johnny carries little Jim toward the Union camp, but as they run through the woods, Flash is shot by rebel soldiers and dies.After the war ends in 1865, Johnny finds Susanna in a wretched asylum and takes her home. He returns to his teaching job, but his friends believe he should run for Congress. Susanna realizes that it is she who holds him back, and that Nell still deeply loves him. That night, Susanna, telling Jim that she hopes to find the golden rain-tree for Johnny, says goodbye and runs toward the swamp. Alarmed, Jim follows her, and soon afterward, a search party is organized. In the morning, Stiles, who has returned to Raintree County to marry the widowed Lydia Gray, discovers that Susanna has drowned. In agony, Johnny continues to search for his son. The weeping boy hears his father's voice, and with great relief, Johnny, Nell and Jim head out of the swamp, unaware of the tall tree gleaming golden in the sunlight."
tt0050894,"['Horror', 'SciFi']","1860 and Baron Frankenstein [Peter Cushing] is to be executed for the murders his creature committed. The Baron is taken from his prison cell to the guillotine but a scuffle is heard before the blade drops...In a bar, two drunk grave robbers Fritz [Lionel Jeffries] and Kurt [Michael Ripper] talk about a potential job. Kurt is reluctant at first but agrees when he hears the price. They open the grave of Baron Frankenstein but inside the coffin is the priest from the execution. Frankenstein appears, causing Fritz to suffer a fatal heart attack in shock. The Baron and his partially paralysed and deformed assistant Karl [Oscar Quitak] bury Fritz in the open grave.Three years later and Baron Frankenstein is now practising as a medical doctor called Dr. Stein in Carlsbruck but is not a member of the town's medical council. The council are not happy about this so they send a delegation to try to persuade him to join or to stop him practising. Stein is working in his overcrowded hospital ward full of sick patients when the council delegation arrives. He refuses to join them, saying the council only exists to eliminate competition and he has succeeded alone.Doctor Hans Kleve [Francis Matthews] is waiting for Stein when he returns to his office from the ward. He recognises Stein as Baron Frankenstein and negotiates to work with and learn from him in exchange for his silence about the Baron's former indiscretions. Stein agrees and takes Kleve to his laboratory and introduces him to Karl. In the laboratory are various body parts that Stein has removed from patients in his hospital ward. Stein demonstrates how disembodied eyes and a hand connected to a remote brain react to a flame. Also in the laboratory is a chimpanzee into which Stein has transplanted the brain of a orangutan. In another preservation tank, Stein shows Kleve a complete man [Michael Gwynn] constructed from various body parts. The only thing missing is a live brain. Karl helped Stein escape the guillotine and has agreed to donate his brain in return for the new body.Back at the hospital, Margaret [Eunice Gayson], the daughter of the president of the medical council, arrives at the ward to work with Stein and Kleve as a compromise to allow Stein to keep his hospital open.That night in the laboratory, Stein and Kleve perform the operation on Karl and transplant his brain into the new body. During the operation the creature becomes highly agitated and they have to subdue it until the brain becomes used to the new body. They move Karl to the hospital but are seen by the hospital porter who confides in Margaret about Stein's activities.The next day Margaret visits Karl and releases him from his straps because he is uncomfortable. The hospital assistant talks to Kleve about changes in animals. This prompts Kleve to start wondering if a brain may react differently in a different body. Kleve returns to the laboratory where he and Stein discuss the chimpanzee which has started eating meat since its brain transplant.Karl escapes from his room at the hospital via the window and returns to the laboratory that night after Stein and Kleve have left. He finds his old body and throws it into a furnace but is overheard by the janitor [George Woodbridge] who comes to investigate. At first the janitor thinks the chimpanzee is making the noise, but as Karl tries to leave he accidentally starts up lab equipment connected to another complete body in a glass tank. The janitor fights with Karl and although Karl is meek to start with he soon becomes angry and kills the janitor.Stein and Kleve go to Karl's room to find him gone. They rush back to the laboratory and find the janitor's body and the burnt remains of Karl's old body. Stein tells Kleve to return to the hospital and continue as normal.Margaret finds Karl hiding in her stables so goes to the hospital to fetch Kleve. Meanwhile, Karl is struggling to control his new body in the stable and when Margaret and Kleve return, Karl has gone.That night, Stein and Kleve search for Karl. Karl murders a girl as his cannibal tendencies start to develop. Stein and Kleve go to Margaret's house and the now disfigured Karl breaks in and implores Frankenstein to help him. One of the other house guests, Dr Molke [Arnold Diamond], sees this and reports Frankenstein to the medical council.Stein and Kleve attend the medical council where Stein denies he is Baron Frankenstein and suggests they obtain proof. The medical council open the Baron's grave again and find the priest's body.Back in the hospital ward, none of the patients want to be treated by the man they now believe to be Frankenstein. The patients all attack Frankenstein but before they kill him Kleve arrives and takes him to the laboratory to tend to his injuries. However, Frankenstein is mortally wounded so Kleve transplants his brain from his disfigured and mutilated body into a new one. A police inspector and the medical council members arrive at the laboratory to arrest Frankenstein but Kleve shows them Frankenstein's old body and they leave, believing Frankenstein to now be dead.Frankenstein and Kleve relocate to Harley Street in London where Frankenstein resumes practising medicine under the name Dr Franck."
tt0050976,"['Drama', 'Fantasy']","The night had brought little relief from the heat, and at dawn a hot gust of
wind blows across the colorless sea. The KNIGHT, Antonius Block, lies
prostrate on some spruce branches spread over the fine sand. His eyes are wide-open and bloodshot from lack of sleep.Nearby his squire JONS is snoring loudly. He has fallen asleep where he collapsed, at the edge of the forest among the wind-gnarled fir trees. His open mouth gapes towards the dawn, and unearthly sounds come from his throat.
At the sudden gust of wind, the horses stir, stretching their parched muzzles towards the sea. They are as thin and worn as their masters.The KNIGHT has risen and waded into the shallow water, where he rinses his sunburned face and blistered lips. JONS rolls over to face the forest and the darkness. He moans in his sleep and vigorously scratches the stubbled hair on his head. A scar stretches diagonally across his scalp, as white as lightning against the grime.The KNIGHT returns to the beach and falls on his knees. With his eyes closed and brow furrowed, he says his morning prayers. His hands are clenched together and his lips form the words silently. His face is sad and bitter. He opens his eyes and stares directly into the morning sun which wallows up from the misty sea like some bloated, dying fish. The sky is gray and immobile, a dome of lead. A cloud hangs mute and dark over the western horizon. High up, barely visible, a seagull floats on motionless wings. Its cry is weird and restless. The KNIGHT'S large gray horse lifts its head and whinnies. Antonius Block turns around.Behind him stands a man in black. His face is very pale and he keeps his hands hidden in the wide folds of his cloak.KNIGHT Who are you?DEATH I am Death.KNIGHT Have you come for me?DEATH I have been walking by your side for a long time.KNIGHT That I know.DEATH Are you prepared?KNIGHT
My body is frightened, but I am not.DEATH Well, there is no shame in that.The KNIGHT has risen to his feet. He shivers. DEATH opens his cloak to place it around the KNIGHT'S shoulders.KNIGHT Wait a moment.DEATH That's what they all say. I grant no reprieves.KNIGHT You play chess, don't you?A gleam of interest kindles in DEATH'S eyes.DEATH How did you know that?KNIGHT I have seen it in paintings and heard it sung in ballads.DEATH Yes, in fact I'm quite a good chess player.KNIGHT But you can't be better than I am.The KNIGHT rummages in the big black bag which he keeps beside him and takes out a small chessboard. He places it carefully on the ground and begins setting up the pieces.DEATH Why do you want to play chess with me?KNIGHT I have my reasons.DEATH That is your privilege.KNIGHT The condition is that I may live as long as I hold out against you. If I win, you will release me. Is it agreed?The KNIGHT holds out his two fists to DEATH, who smiles at him suddenly. DEATH points to one of the KNIGHT'S hands; it contains a black pawn.KNIGHT You drew black!DEATH Very appropriate. Don't you think so?The KNIGHT and DEATH bend over the chessboard. After a moment of hesitation, Antonius Block opens with his king's pawn. DEATH moves, also using his king's pawn.The morning breeze has died down. The restless movement of the sea has ceased, the water is silent. The sun rises from the haze and its glow whitens. The sea gull floats under the dark cloud, frozen in space. The day is already scorchingly hot.The squire JONS is awakened by a kick in the rear. Opening his eyes, he grunts like a pig and yawns broadly. He scrambles to his feet, saddles his horse and picks up the heavy pack.The KNIGHT slowly rides away from the sea, into the forest near the beach and up towards the road. He pretends not to hear the morning prayers of his squire. JONS soon overtakes him.JONS (sings)
Between a strumpet's legs to lie Is the life for which I sigh.He stops and looks at his master, but the KNIGHT hasn't heard JON'S song, or he pretends that he hasn't. To give further vent to his irritation, JONS sings even louder.JONS (sings)
Up above is God Almighty So very far away, But your brother the Devil You will meet on every level.JONS finally gets the KNIGHT'S attention. He stops singing. The KNIGHT, his horse, JONS'S own horse and JONS himself know all the songs by heart. The long, dusty journey from the Holy Land hasn't made them any cleaner. They ride across a mossy heath which stretches towards the horizon. Beyond it, the sea lies shimmering in the white glitter of the sun.JONS In Frjestad everyone was talking about evil omens and other horrible things. Two horses had eaten each other in the night, and, in the churchyard, graves had been opened and the remains of corpses scattered all over the place. Yesterday afternoon there were as many as four suns in the heavens.
The KNIGHT doesn't answer. Close by, a scrawny dog is whining, crawling towards its master, who is sleeping in a sitting position in the blazing hot sun. A black cloud of flies clusters around his head and shoulders. The miserable-looking dog whines incessantly as it lies flat on its stomach, wagging its tail.JONS dismounts and approaches the sleeping man. JONS addresses him politely. When he doesn't receive an answer, he walks up to the man in order to shake him awake. He bends over the sleeping man's shoulder, but quickly pulls back his hand. The man falls backward on the heath, his face turned towards JONS. It is a corpse, staring at JONS with empty eye sockets and white teeth.JONS remounts and overtakes his master. He takes a drink from his waterskin and hands the bag to the knight.KNIGHT Well, did he show you the way?JONS Not exactly.KNIGHT What did he say?JONS Nothing.KNIGHT Was he a mute?JONS No, sir, I wouldn't say that. As a matter of fact, he was quite eloquent.KNIGHT Oh?JONS He was eloquent, all right. The trouble is that what he had to say was most depressing.
(sings)
One moment you're bright and lively, The next you're crawling with worms. Fate is a terrible villain And you, my friend, its poor victim.KNIGHT Must you sing?JONS No.The KNIGHT hands his squire a piece of bread, which keeps him quiet for a while. The sun burns down on them cruelly, and beads of perspiration trickle down their faces. There is a cloud of dust around the horses' hooves. They ride past an inlet and along verdant groves. In the shade of some large trees stands a bulging wagon covered with a mottled canvas. A horse whinnies nearby and is answered by the KNIGHT'S horse. The two travelers do not stop to rest under the shade of the trees but continue riding until they disappear at the bend of the road.In his sleep, JOF the juggler hears the neighing of his horse and the answer from a distance. He tries to go on sleeping, but it is stifling inside the wagon. The rays of the sun filtering through the canvas cast streaks of light across the face of JOF'S wife, MIA, and their one-year-old son, MIKAEL, who are sleeping deeply and peacefully. Near them, JONAS SKAT, an older man, snores loudly.JOF crawls out of the wagon. There is still a spot of shade under the big trees. He takes a drink of water, gargles, stretches and talks to his scrawny old horse.JOF Good morning. Have you had breakfast? I can't eat grass, worse luck. Can't you teach me how? We're a little hard up. People aren't very interested in juggling in this part of the country.He has picked up the juggling balls and slowly begins to toss them. Then he stands on his head and cackles like a hen. Suddenly he stops and sits down with a look of utter astonishment on his face. The wind causes the trees to sway slightly. The leaves stir and there is a soft murmur. The flowers and the grass bend gracefully, and somewhere a bird raises its voice in a long warble.JOF'S face breaks into a smile and his eyes fill with tears. With a dazed expression he sits flat on his behind while the grass rustles softly, and bees and butterflies hum around his head. The unseen bird continues to sing.Suddenly the breeze stops blowing, the bird stops singing, JOF'S smile fades, the flowers and grass wilt in the heat. The old horse is still walking around grazing and swishing its tail to ward off the flies.JOF comes to life. He rushes into the wagon and shakes MIA awake.JOF Mia, wake up. Wake up! Mia, I've just seen something. I've got to tell you about it!MIA (sits up, terrified)
What is it? What's happened?JOF Listen, I've had a vision. No, it wasn't a vision. It was real, absolutely real.MIA Oh, so you've had a vision again!MIA's voice is filled with gentle irony. JOF shakes his head and grabs her by the shoulders.JOF But I did see her!MIA Whom did you see?JOF The Virgin Mary.MIA can't help being impressed by her husband's fervor. She lowers her voice.MIA Did you really see her?JOF She was so close to me that I could have touched her. She had a golden crown on her head and wore a blue gown with flowers of gold. She was barefoot and had small brown hands with which she was holding the Child and teaching Him to walk. And then she saw me watching her and she smiled at me. My eyes filled with tears and when I wiped them away, she had disappeared. And everything became so still in the sky and on the earth. Can you understand ...MIA What an imagination you have.JOF You don't believe me! But it was real, I tell you, not the kind of reality you see every day, but a different kind.MIA
Perhaps it was the kind of reality you told us about when you saw the Devil painting our wagon wheels red, using his tail as a brush.JOF (embarrassed)
Why must you keep bringing that up?MIA
And then you discovered that you had red paint under your nails.JOF Well, perhaps that time I made it up. (eagerly) I did it just so that you would believe in my other visions. The real ones. The ones that I didn't make up.MIA (severely)
You have to keep your visions under control.
Otherwise people will think that you're a half-wit, which you're not. At least not yet -- as far as I know. But, come to think of it, I'm not so sure about that.JOF (angry)
I didn't ask to have visions. I can't help it if voices speak to me, if the Holy Virgin appears before me and angels and devils like my company.SKAT (sits up)
Haven't I told you once and for all that I need my morning's sleep! I have asked you politely, pleaded with you, but nothing works. So now I'm telling you to shut up!His eyes are popping with rage. He turns over and continues snoring where he left off. MIA and JOF decide that it would be wisest to leave the wagon. They sit down on a crate. MIA has MIKAEL on her knees. He is naked and squirms vigorously. JOF sits close to his wife. Slumped over, he still looks dazed and astonished. A dry, hot wind blows from the sea.MIA If we would only get some rain. Everything is burned to cinders. We won't have anything to eat this winter.JOF (yawning)
We'll get by.He says this smilingly, with a casual air. He stretches and laughs contentedly.MIA I want Mikael to have a better life than ours.JOF Mikael will grow up to be a great acrobat -- or a juggler who can do the one impossible trick.MIA What's that?JOF To make one of the balls stand absolutely still
in the air.MIA But that's impossible.JOF Impossible for us -- but not for him.MIA You're dreaming again.She yawns. The sun, has made her a bit drowsy and she lies down on the grass.
JOF does likewise and puts one arm around his wife's shoulders.JOF I've composed a song. I made it up during the night when I couldn't sleep. Do you want to hear it?MIA Sing it. I'm very curious.
JOF I have to sit up first.He sits with his legs crossed, makes a dramatic gesture with his arms and sings in a loud voice.JOF (sings)
On a lily branch a dove is perched Against the summer sky, She sings a wondrous song of Christ And there's great joy on high.He interrupts his singing in order to be complimented by his wife.JOF Mia! Are you asleep?MIA It's a lovely song.JOF I haven't finished yet.
MIA I heard it, but I think I'll sleep a little longer. You can sing the rest to me afterwards.JOF All you do is sleep.JOF is a bit offended and glances over at his son, MIKAEL, but he is also sleeping soundly in the high grass. JONAS SKAT comes out from the wagon. He yawns; he is very tired and in a bad humor. In his hands he holds a crudely made death mask.SKAT Is this supposed to be a mask for an actor? If the priests didn't pay us so well, I'd say no thank you.JOF Are you going to play Death?
SKAT Just think, scaring decent folk out of their wits with this kind of nonsense.JOF When are we supposed to do this play?SKAT At the saints' feast in Elsinore. We're going to perform right on the church steps, believe it or not.
JOF Wouldn't it be better to play something bawdy? People like it better, and, besides, it's more fun.SKAT Idiot. There's a rumor going around that there's a terrible pestilence in the land, and now the priests are prophesying sudden death and all sorts of spiritual agonies.MIA is awake now and lies contentedly on her back, sucking on a blade of grass and looking smilingly at her husband.
JOF And what part am I to play?SKAT You're such a damn fool, so you're going to be the Soul of Man.JOF That's a bad part, of course.SKAT Who makes the decisions around here? Who is the
director of this company anyhow?SKAT, grinning, holds the mask in front of his face and recites dramatically.SKAT Bear this in mind, you fool. Your life hangs by a thread. Your time is short. (in his usual voice) Are the women going to like me in this getup? Will I make a hit? No! I feel as if I were dead already.He stumbles into the wagon muttering furiously. JOF sits, leaning forward. MIA lies beside him on the grass.MIA Jof!
JOF What is it?
MIA Sit still. Don't move.JOF What do you mean?MIA Don't say anything.JOF I'm as silent as a grave.MIA Shh! I love you.Waves of heat envelop the gray stone church in a strange white mist. The KNIGHT dismounts and enters. After tying up the horses, JONS slowly follows him in. When he comes onto the church porch he stops in surprise. To the right of the entrance there is a large fresco on the wall, not quite finished. Perched on a crude scaffolding is a PAINTER wearing a red cap and paint-stained clothes. He has one brush in his mouth, while with another in his hand he outlines a small, terrified human face amidst a sea of other faces.JONS What is this supposed to represent?PAINTER The Dance of Death.JONS And that one is Death?
PAINTER Yes, he dances off with all of them.
JONS Why do you paint such nonsense?PAINTER I thought it would serve to remind people that they must die.
JONS Well, it's not going to make them feel any happier.PAINTER Why should one always make people happy? It might not be a bad idea to scare them a little once in a while.JONS Then they'll close their eyes and refuse to look at your painting.
PAINTER Oh, they'll look. A skull is almost more interesting than a naked woman.
JONS If you do scare them ...PAINTER They'll think.JONS And if they think ...
PAINTER They'll become still more scared.
JONS And then they'll run right into the arms of the priests.PAINTER That's not my business.
JONS You're only painting your Dance of Death.PAINTER I'm only painting things as they are. Everyone else can do as he likes.JONS Just think how some people will curse you.PAINTER Maybe. But then I'll paint something amusing for them to look at. I have to make a living -- at least until the plague takes me.
JONS The plague. That sounds horrible.PAINTER You should see the boils on a diseased man's throat. You should see how his body shrivels up so that his legs look like knotted strings -- like the man I've painted over there.The PAINTER points with his brush. JONS sees a small human form writhing in the grass, its eyes turned upwards in a frenzied look of horror and pain.JONS That looks terrible.PAINTER It certainly does. He tries to rip out the boil, he bites his hands, tears his veins open with his fingernails and his screams can be heard everywhere. Does that scare you?
JONS Scare? Me? You don't know me. What are the horrors you've painted over there?PAINTER The remarkable thing is that the poor creatures
think the pestilence is the Lord's punishment. Mobs of people who call themselves Slaves of Sin are swarming over the country, flagellating themselves and others, all for the glory of God.JONS Do they really whip themselves?PAINTER Yes, it's a terrible sight. I crawl into a ditch and hide when they pass by.JONS Do you have any brandy? I've been drinking water all day and it's made me as thirsty as a camel in the desert.PAINTER I think I frightened you after all.JONS sits down with the PAINTER, who produces a jug of brandy.The KNIGHT is kneeling before a small altar. It is dark and quiet around him.
The air is cool and musty. Pictures of saints look down on him with stony eyes. Christ's face is turned upwards, His mouth open as if in a cry of anguish. On the ceiling beam there is a representation of a hideous devil spying on a miserable human being. The KNIGHT hears a sound from the confession booth and approaches it. The face of DEATH appears behind the grille for an instant, but the KNIGHT doesn't see him.KNIGHT I want to talk to you as openly as I can, but my heart is empty.DEATH doesn't answer.
KNIGHT The emptiness is a mirror turned towards my own face. I see myself in it, and I am filled with fear and disgust.DEATH doesn't answer.
KNIGHT Through my indifference to my fellow men, I have isolated myself from their company. Now I live in a world of phantoms. I am imprisoned in my dreams and fantasies.DEATH And yet you don't want to die.KNIGHT Yes, I do.
DEATH What are you waiting for?KNIGHT I want knowledge.DEATH You want guarantees?KNIGHT Call it whatever you like. Is it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why should He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles?DEATH doesn't answer.
KNIGHT How can we have faith in those who believe when we can't have faith in ourselves? What is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but aren't able to? And what is to become of those who neither want to nor are capable of believing?The KNIGHT stops and waits for a reply, but no one speaks or answers him. There is complete silence.KNIGHT Why can't I kill God within me? Why does He live on in this painful and humiliating way even though I curse Him and want to tear Him out of my heart? Why, in spite of everything, is He a baffling reality that I can't shake off? Do you hear me?DEATH Yes, I hear you.KNIGHT I want knowledge, not faith, not suppositions, but knowledge. I want God to stretch out His hand towards me, reveal Himself and speak to me.DEATH But He remains silent.
KNIGHT
I call out to Him in the dark but no one seems to be there.
DEATH Perhaps no one is there.
KNIGHT Then life is an outrageous horror. No one can live in the face of death, knowing that all is nothingness.DEATH Most people never reflect about either death or the futility of life.KNIGHT But one day they will have to stand at that last moment of life and look towards the darkness.DEATH When that day comes ...
KNIGHT In our fear, we make an image, and that image we call God.
DEATH You are worrying ...KNIGHT Death visited me this morning. We are playing chess together. This reprieve gives me the chance to arrange an urgent matter.DEATH What matter is that?
KNIGHT My life has been a futile pursuit, a wandering, a great deal of talk without meaning. I feel no bitterness or self-reproach because the lives of most people are very much like this. But I will use my reprieve for one meaningful deed.DEATH Is that why you are playing chess with Death?KNIGHT He is a clever opponent, but up to now I haven't lost a single man.DEATH How will you outwit Death in your game?KNIGHT I use a combination of the bishop and the knight which he hasn't yet discovered. In the next move I'll shatter one of his flanks.DEATH I'll remember that.DEATH shows his face at the grill of the confession booth for a moment but disappears instantly.KNIGHT You've tricked and cheated me! But we'll meet again, and I'll find a way.DEATH (invisible)
We'll meet at the inn, and there we'll continue playing.The KNIGHT raises his hand and looks at it in the sunlight which comes through the tiny window.KNIGHT This is my hand. I can move it, feel the blood pulsing through it. The sun is still high in the sky and I, Antonius Block, am playing chess with Death.He makes a fist of his hand and lifts it to his temple.Meanwhile, JONS and the PAINTER have got drunk and are talking animatedly together.JONS Me and my master have been abroad and have just come home. Do you understand, you little pictor?PAINTER The Crusade.JONS (drunk)
Precisely. For ten years we sat in the Holy Land and let snakes bite us, flies sting us, wild animals eat us, heathens butcher us, the wine poison us, the women give us lice, the lice devour us, the fevers rot us, all for the Glory of God. Our crusade was such madness that only a real idealist could have thought it up. But what you said about the plague was horrible.PAINTER It's worse than that.JONS Ah, me. No matter which way you turn, you have your rump behind you. That's the truth.PAINTER The rump behind you, the rump behind you there's a profound truth.JONS paints a small figure which is supposed to represent himself.JONS This is squire Jns. He grins at Death, mocks the Lord, laughs at himself and leers at the girls. His world is a Jnsworld, believable only to himself, ridiculous to all including himself, meaningless to Heaven and of no interest to Hell.The KNIGHT walks by, calls to his squire and goes out into the bright sunshine. JONS manages to set himself down from the scaffolding.Outside the church, four soldiers and a monk are in the process of putting a woman in the stocks. Her face is pale and child-like, her head has been shaved, and her knuckles are bloody and broken. Her eyes are wide open, yet she doesn't appear to be fully conscious.JONS and the KNIGHT stop and watch in silence. The soldiers are working quickly and skillfully, but they seem frightened and dejected. The monk mumbles from a small book. One of the soldiers picks up a wooden bucket and with his hand begins to smear a bloody paste on the wall of the church and around the woman. JONS holds his nose.JONS That soup of yours has a hell of a stink. What is it good for?SOLDIER She has had carnal intercourse with the Evil One.He whispers this with a horrified face and continues to splash the sticky mess on the wall.JONS And now she's in the stocks.SOLDIER She will be burned tomorrow morning at the parish boundary. But we have to keep the Devil away from the rest of us.JONS (holding his nose)
And you do that with this stinking mess?SOLDIER It's the best remedy: blood mixed with the bile of a big black dog. The Devil can't stand the smell.JONS Neither can I.
JONS walks over towards the horses. The KNIGHT stands for a few, moments looking at the young girl. She is almost a child. Slowly she turns her eyes towards him.KNIGHT Have you seen the Devil?The MONK stops reading and raises his head.MONK You must not talk to her.KNIGHT Can that be so dangerous?MONK I don't know, but she is believed to have caused the pestilence with which we are affected.KNIGHT I understand.He nods resignedly and walks away. The young woman starts to moan as though she were having a horrible nightmare. The sound of her cries follows the two riders for a considerable distance down the road.The sun stands high in the sky, like a red ball of fire. The waterskin is empty and JONS looks for a well where he can fill it.They approach a group of peasant cottages at the edge of the forest. JONS ties up the horses, slings the skin over his shoulder and walks along the path towards the nearest cottage. As always, his movements are light and almost soundless. The door to the cottage is open. He stops outside, but when no one appears he enters. It is very dark inside and his foot touches a soft object. He looks down. Beside the whitewashed fireplace, a woman is lying with her face to the ground.At the sound of approaching steps, JONS quickly hides behind the door. A man comes down a ladder from the loft. He is broad and thick-set. His eyes are black and his face is pale and puffy. His clothes are well cut but dirty and in rags. He carries a cloth sack. Looking around, he goes into the inner room, bends over the bed, tucks something into the bag, slinks along the walls, looking on the shelves, finds something else which he tucks in his bag.Slowly he re-enters the outer room, bends over the dead woman and carefully slips a ring from her finger. At that moment a young woman comes through the door. She stops and stares at the stranger.RAVEL Why do you look so surprised? I steal from the dead. These days it's quite a lucrative enterprise.The GIRL makes a movement as if to run away.RAVEL You're thinking of running to the village and telling. That wouldn't serve any purpose. Each of us has to save his own skin. It's as simple as that.GIRL Don't touch me.RAVAL Don't try to scream. There's no one around to hear you, neither God nor man.Slowly he closes the door behind the GIRL. The stuffy room is now in almost total darkness. But JONS becomes clearly visible.JONS I recognize you, although it's a long time since we met. Your name is Raval, from the theological college at Roskilde. You are Dr. Mirabilis, Coelestis et Diabilis.RAVAL smiles uneasily and looks around.JONS Am I not right?The GIRL stands immobile.JONS You were the one who, ten years ago, convinced my master of the necessity to join a better-
class crusade to the Holy Land.RAVAL looks around.
JONS You look uncomfortable. Do you have a stomach-
ache?RAVAL smiles anxiously.JONS When I see you, I suddenly understand the meaning of these ten years, which previously seemed to me such a waste. Our life was too good and we were too satisfied with ourselves. The Lord wanted to punish us for our complacency. That is why He sent you to spew out your holy venom and poison the knight.RAVEL I acted in good faith.JONS But now you know better, don't you? Because now you have turned into a thief. A more fitting and rewarding occupation for scoundrels. Isn't that so?With a quick movement he knocks the knife out of RAVAL'S hand, gives him a kick so that he falls on the floor and is about to finish him off. Suddenly the GIRL screams. JONS stops and makes a gesture of generosity with his hand.
JONS By all means. I'm not bloodthirsty.He bends over RAVAL.RAVEL Don't beat me.JONS I don't have the heart to touch you, Doctor. But remember this: the next time we meet, I'll brand your face the way one does with thieves. (he rises)
What I really came for is to get my waterskin filled.GIRL We have a deep well with cool, fresh water. Come, I'll show you.They walk out of the house. RAVAL lies still for a few moments, then he rises slowly and looks around. When no one is in sight, he takes his bag and steals away. JONS quenches his thirst and fills his bag with water. The GIRL helps him.JONS Jns is my name. I am a pleasant and talkative young man who has never had anything but kind thoughts and has only done beautiful and noble deeds. I'm kindest of all to young women. With them, there is no limit to my kindness.He embraces her and tries to kiss her, but she holds herself back. Almost immediately he loses interest, hoists the waterbag on his shoulder and pats the GIRL on the cheek.JONS Goodbye, my girl. I could very well have raped you, but between you and me, I'm tired of that kind of love. It runs a little dry in the end.He laughs kindly and walks away from her. When he has walked a short distance he turns; the GIRL is still there.JONS Now that I think of it, I will need a housekeeper. Can you prepare good food? (the GIRL nods)
As far as I know, I'm still a married man, but
I have high hopes that my wife is dead by now.
That's why I need a housekeeper. (the GIRL doesn't answer but gets up)
The devil with it! Come along and don't stand there staring. I've saved your life, so you owe me a great deal.She begins walking towards him, her head bent. He doesn't wait for her but walks towards the KNIGHT, who patiently awaits his squire.The Embarrassment Inn lies in the eastern section of the province. The plague has not yet reached this area on its way along the coast.The actors have placed their wagon under a tree in the yard of the inn. Dressed in colorful costumes, they perform a farce.The spectators watch the performance, commenting on it noisily. There are
merchants with fat, beer-sweaty faces, apprentices and journeymen, farmhands and milkmaids. A whole flock of children perch in the trees around the wagon.
The KNIGHT and his squire have sat down in the shadow of a wall. They drink beer and doze in the midday heat. The GIRL from the deserted village sleeps at JONS'S side. SKAT beats the drums, JOF blows the flute, MIA performs a gay and lively dance. They perspire under the hot white sun. When they have finished SKAT comes forward and bows.SKAT Noble ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your interest. Please remain standing for a
little longer, or sit on the ground, because we are now going to perform a tragedia about an unfaithful wife, her jealous husband, and the handsome lover -- that's me.MIA and JOF have quickly changed costumes and again step out on the stage. They bow, to the public.SKAT Here is the husband. Here is the wife. If you'll shut up over there, you'll see something splendid. As I said, I play the lover and I haven't entered yet. That's why I'm going to hide behind the curtain for the time being. (he wipes the sweat from his forehead)
It's damned hot. I think we'll have a thunderstorm.He places his leg in front of JOF as if to trip him, raises MIA's skirt, makes a face as if he could see all the wonders of the world underneath it, and disappears behind the gaudily patched curtains.SKAT is very handsome, now that he can see himself in the reflection of a tin washbowl. His hair is tightly curled, his eyebrows are beautifully bushy, glittering earrings vie for equal attention with his teeth, and his cheeks are flushed rose red.
He sits out in back on the tailboard of the wagon, dangling his legs and whistling to himself.
In the meantime JOF and MIA play their tragedy; it is not, however, received with great acclaim. SKAT suddenly discovers that someone is watching him as he gazes contentedly into the tin bowl. A woman stands there, stately in both height and volume.
SKAT frowns, toys with his small dagger and occasionally throws a roguish but fiery glance at the beautiful visitor. She suddenly discovers that one of her shoes doesn't quite fit. She leans down to fix it and in doing so allows her generous bosom to burst out of its prison -- no more than honor and chastity allow, but still enough so that the actor with his experienced eye immediately sees that there are ample rewards to be had here.Now she comes a little closer, kneels down and opens a bundle containing several dainty morsels and a skin filled with red wine. JONAS SKAT manages not to fall off the wagon in his excitement. Standing on the steps of the wagon, he supports himself against a nearby tree, crosses his legs and bows.
The woman quietly bites into a chicken leg dripping with fat. At this moment the actor is stricken by a radiant glance full of lustful appetites.When he sees this look, SKAT makes an instantaneous decision, jumps down from the wagon and kneels in front of the blushing damsel.She becomes weak and faint from his nearness, looks at him with a glassy glance and breathes heavily. SKAT doesn't neglect to press kisses on her small, chubby hands. The sun shines brightly and small birds make noises in the bushes.Now she is forced to sit back; her legs seem unwilling to support her any longer. Bewildered, she singles out another chicken leg from the large sack of food and holds it up in front of SKAT with an appealing and triumphant expression, as if it were her maidenhood being offered as a prize.SKAT hesitates momentarily, but he is still the strategist. He lets the chicken leg fall to the grass, and murmurs in the woman's rosy ear.His words seem to please her. She puts her arms around the actor's neck and pulls him to her with such fierceness that both of them lose their balance and tumble down on the soft grass. The small birds take to their wings with frightened shrieks.JOF stands in the hot sun with a flickering lantern in his hand. MIA pretends to be asleep on a bench which has been pulled forward on the stage.JOF Night and moonlight now prevail Here sleeps my wife so frail ...VOICE FROM THE PUBLIC
Does she snore?JOF May I point out that this is a tragedy, and in tragedies one doesn't snore.VOICE FROM THE PUBLIC
I think she should snore anyhow.This opinion causes mirth in the audience. JOF becomes slightly confused and goes out of character, but MIA keeps her head and begins snoring.JOF Night and moonlight now prevail.
There snores -- I mean sleeps -- my wife so frail. Jealous I am, as never before, I hide myself behind this door. Faithful is she To her lover -- not me. He soon comes a-stealing To awaken her lusty feeling. I shall now kill him dead For cuckolding me in my bed. There he comes in the moonlight, His white legs shining bright. Quiet as a mouse, here I'll lie, Tell him not that he's about to die.JOF hides himself. MIA immediately ends her snoring and sits up, looking to the left.MIA Look, there he comes in the night My lover, my heart's delight.She becomes silent and looks wide-eyed in front of her. The mood in the yard in front of the inn has, up to now, been rather lighthearted despite the heat.
Now a rapid change occurs. People who had been laughing and chattering fall silent. Their faces seem to pale under their sunbrowned skins, the children stop their games and stand with gaping mouths and frightened eyes.
JOF steps out in front of the curtain. His painted face bears an expression of horror. MIA has risen with MIKAEL in her arms. Some of the women in the yard have fallen on their knees, others hide their faces, many begin to mutter half-forgotten prayers.All have turned their faces towards the white road. Now a shrill song is heard. It is frenzied, almost a scream. A crucified Christ sways above the hilltop.The cross-bearers soon come into sight. They are Dominican monks, their hoods pulled down over their faces. More and more of them follow, carrying litters with heavy coffins or clutching holy relics, their hands stretched out spasmodically. The dust wells up around their black hoods; the censers sway and emit a thick, ashen smoke which smells of rancid herbs.After the line of monks comes another procession. It is a column of men, boys, old men, women, girls, children. All of them have steel-edged scourges in their hands with which they whip themselves and each other, howling ecstatically. They twist in pain; their eyes bulge wildly; their lips are gnawed to shreds and dripping with foam. They have been seized by madness. They bite their own hands and arms, whip each other in violent, almost rhythmic outbursts. Throughout it all the shrill song howls from their bursting throats. Many sway and fall, lift themselves up again, support each
other and help each other to intensify the scourging.Now the procession pauses at the crossroads in front of the inn. The monks fall on their knees, hiding their faces with clenched hands, arms pressed tightly together. Their song never stops. The Christ figure on its timbered cross is raised above the heads of the crowd. It is not Christ triumphant, but the suffering Jesus with the sores, the blood, the hammered nails and the face in convulsive pain. The Son of God, nailed on the wood of the cross, suffering scorn and shame.
The penitents have now sunk down in the dirt of the road. They collapse where they stood like slaughtered cattle. Their screams rise with the song of the monks, through misty clouds of incense, towards the white fire of the sun.
A large square monk rises from his knees and reveals his face, which is red-
brown from the sun. His eyes glitter; his voice is thick with impotent scorn.MONK
God has sentenced us to punishment. We shall all perish in the black death. You, standing there like gaping cattle, you who sit there in your glutted complacency, do you know that this may be your last hour? Death stands right behind you. I can see how his crown gleams in the sun. His scythe flashes as he raises it above your heads. Which one of you shall he strike first? You there, who stand staring like a goat, will your mouth be twisted into the last unfinished gasp before nightfall? And you, woman, who bloom with life and self-
satisfaction, will you pale and become extinguished before the morning dawns? You back
there, with your swollen nose and stupid grin, do you have another year left to dirty the earth with your refuse? Do you know, you insensible fools, that you shall die today or tomorrow, or the next day, because all of you have been sentenced? Do you hear what I say? Do you hear the word? You have been sentenced, sentenced!The MONK falls silent, looking around with a bitter face and a cold, scornful
glance. Now, he clenches his hands, straddles the ground and turns his face
upwards.MONK
Lord have mercy on us in our humiliation! Don't turn your face from us in loathing and contempt, but be merciful to us for the sake of your son, Jesus Christ.He makes the sign of the cross over the crowd and then begins a new song in a
strong voice. The monks rise and join in the song. As if driven by some superhuman force, the penitents begin to whip themselves again, still wailing and moaning.The procession continues. New members have joined the rear of the column; others who were unable to go on lie weeping in the dust of the road. JONS the squire drinks his beer.JONS This damned ranting about doom. Is that food for the minds of modern people? Do they really expect us to take them seriously?The KNIGHT grins tiredly.JONS Yes, now you grin at me, my lord. But allow me to point out that I've either read, heard or experienced most of the tales which we people tell each other.KNIGHT (yawns) Yes, yes.
JONS Even the ghost stories about God the Father, the angels, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost --
all these I've accepted without too much emotion.He leans down over the GIRL as she crouches at his feet and pats her on the head. The KNIGHT drinks his beer silently.JONS (contentedly)
My little stomach is my world, my head is my eternity, and my hands, two wonderful suns. My legs are time's damned pendulums, and my dirty feet are two splendid starting points for my philosophy. Everything is worth precisely as much as a belch, the only difference being that a belch is more satisfying.The beer mug is empty. Sighing, JONS gets to his feet. The GIRL follows him like a shadow.In the yard he meets a large man with a sooty face and a dark expression. He stops JONS with a roar.JONS What are you screaming about?PLOG I am Plog, the smith, and you are the squire Jns.JONS That's possible.PLOG Have you seen my wife?
JONS No, I haven't. But if I had seen her and she looked like you, I'd quickly forget that I'd seen her.PLOG
Well, in that case you haven't seen her.JONS Maybe she's run off.PLOG Do you know anything?
JONS I know quite a lot, but not about your wife. Go to the inn. Maybe they can help you.The smith sighs sadly and goes inside.The inn is very small and full of people eating and drinking to forget their newly aroused fears of eternity. In the open fireplace a roasting pig turns
on an iron spit. The sun shines outside the casement window, its sharp rays
piercing the darkness of the room, which is thick with fumes and
perspiration.
MERCHANT
Yes, it's true! The plague is spreading along the west coast. People are dying like flies. Usually business would be good at this time of year, but, damn it, I've still got my whole stock unsold.WOMAN They speak of the judgment day. And all these omens are terrible. Worms, chopped-off hands and other monstrosities began pouring out of an old woman, and down in the village another woman gave birth to a calf's head.OLD MAN The day of judgment. Imagine.FARMER
It hasn't rained here for a month. We'll surely lose our crops.MERCHANT
And people are acting crazy, I'd say. They flee the country and carry the plague with them wherever they go.OLD MAN The day of judgment. Just think, just think!FARMER If it's as they say, I suppose a person should look after his house and try to enjoy life as long as he can.WOMAN But there have been other things too, such things that can't even be spoken of. (whispers)
Things that mustn't be named -- but the priests say that the woman carries it between her legs and that's why she must cleanse herself.OLD MAN Judgment day. And the Riders of the Apocalypse stand at the bend in the village road. I imagine they'll come on judgment night, at sundown.WOMAN There are many who have purged themselves with
fire and died from it, but the priests say that it's better to die pure than to live for hell.
MERCHANT This is the end, yes, it is. No one says it out
loud, but all of us know that it's the end. And people are going mad from fear.FARMER
So you're afraid too.MERCHANT
Of course I'm afraid.OLD MAN The judgment day becomes night, and the angels descend and the graves open. It will be terrible to see.They whisper in low tones and sit close to each other.PLOG, the smith, shoves his way into a place next to JOF, who is still dressed in his costume. Opposite him sits RAVAL, leaning slightly forward, his face perspiring heavily. RAVAL rolls an armlet out on the table.RAVAL Do you want this armlet? You can have it cheap.JOF I can't afford it.RAVAL It's real silver.JOF It's nice. But it's surely too expensive for me.PLOG Excuse me, but has anyone here seen my wife?JOF Has she disappeared?PLOG They say she's run away.JOF Has she deserted you?PLOG With an actor.JOF An actor! If she's got such bad taste, then I think you should let her go.PLOG You're right. My first thought, of course, was to kill her.JOF Oh. But to murder her, that's a terrible thing to do.PLOG I'm also going to kill the actor.JOF The actor?PLOG Of course, the one she eloped with.JOF What has he done to deserve that?PLOG Are you stupid?
JOF The actor! Now I understand. There are too many of them, so even if he hasn't done anything in particular you ought to kill him merely because he's an actor.PLOG You see, my wife has always been interested in the tricks of the theatre.JOF And that turned out to be her misfortune.PLOG Her misfortune, but not mine, because a person who's born unfortunate can hardly suffer from any further misfortune. Isn't that true?Now RAVAL enters the discussion. He is slightly drunk and his voice is shrill and evil.
RAVAL Listen, you! You sit there and lie to the smith.JOF I! A liar!
RAVAL You're an actor too and it's probably your partner who's run off with Plog's old lady.PLOG Are you an actor too?JOF An actor! Me! I wouldn't quite call myself that!RAVAL We ought to kill you; it's only logical.JOF (laughs)
You're really funny.RAVAL How strange -- you've turned pale. Have you anything on your conscience?JOF You're funny. Don't you think he's funny? (to Plog)
Oh, you don't.RAVAL Maybe we should mark you up a little with a knife, like they do petty scoundrels of your kind.PLOG bangs his hands down on the table so that the dishes jump. He gets up.
PLOG (shouting)
What have you done with my wife?The room becomes silent. JOF looks around, but there is no exit, no way to escape. He puts his hands on the table. Suddenly a knife flashes through the air and sinks into the table top between his fingers.JOF snatches away his hands and raises his head. He looks half surprised, as if the truth had just become apparent to him.
JOF Do you want to hurt me? Why? Have I provoked someone, or got in the way? I'll leave right now and never come back.JOF looks from one face to another, but no one seems ready to help him or come to his defense.
RAVAL Get up so everyone can hear you. Talk louder.Trembling, JOF rises. He opens his mouth as if to say something, but not a word comes out.
RAVAL Stand on your head so that we can see how good an actor you are.JOF gets up on the table and stands on his head. A hand pushes him forward so
that he collapses on the floor. PLOG rises, pulls him to his feet with one hand.PLOG (shouts) What have you done with my wife?PLOG beats him so furiously that JOF flies across the table. RAVAL leans over
him.
RAVAL Don't lie there moaning. Get up and dance.JOF I don't want to. I can't.RAVEL Show us how you imitate a bear.JOF I can't play a bear.RAVAL Let's see if you can't after all.RAVAL prods JOF lightly with the knife point. JOF gets up with cold sweat on his cheeks and forehead, frightened half to death. He begins to jump and hop on top of the tables, swinging his arms and legs and making grotesque faces.
Some laugh, but most of the people sit silently. JOF gasps as if his lungs were about to burst. He sinks to his knees, and someone pours beer over him.RAVEL Up again! Be a good bear.JOF I haven't done any harm. I haven't got the strength to play a bear any more.At that moment the door opens and JONS enters. JOF sees his chance and steals
out. RAVAL intends to follow him, but suddenly stops. JONS and RAVAL look at each other.JONS Do you remember what I was going to do to you if we met again?RAVAL steps back without speaking.JONS I'm a man who keeps his word.JONS raises his knife and cuts RAVAL from forehead to cheek. RAVAL staggers towards the wall.The hot day has become night. Singing and howling can be heard from the inn. In a hollow near the forest, the light still lingers. Hidden in the grass and
the shrubbery, nightingales sing and their voices echo through the stillness.
The players' wagon stands in a small ravine, and not far away the horse grazes on the dry grass. MIA has sat down in front of the wagon with her son in her arms. They play together and laugh happily.Now, a soft gleam of light strokes the hilltops, a last reflection from the red clouds over the sea.Not far from the wagon, the KNIGHT sits crouched over his chess game. He lifts his head.The evening light moves across the heavy wagon wheels, across the woman and the child. The KNIGHT gets up.MIA sees him and smiles. She holds up her struggling son, as if to amuse the KNIGHT.KNIGHT What's his name?MIA Mikael.KNIGHT How old is he?MIA Oh, he'll soon be two.KNIGHT He's big for his age.MIA Do you think so? Yes, I guess he's rather big.She puts the child down on the ground and half rises to shake out her red skirt. When she sits down again, the KNIGHT steps closer.KNIGHT You played some kind of show this afternoon.MIA Did you think it was bad?KNIGHT You are more beautiful now without your face painted, and this gown is more becoming.MIA You see, Jonas Skat has run off and left us, so we're in real trouble now.KNIGHT Is that your husband?MIA (laughs)
Jonas! The other man is my husband. His name is Jof.
KNIGHT Oh, that one.MIA And now there's only him and me. We'll have to start doing tricks again and that's more trouble than it's worth.KNIGHT Do you do tricks also?MIA We certainly do. And Jof is a very skillful juggler.KNIGHT Is Mikael going to be an acrobat?MIA Jof wants him to be.KNIGHT But you don't.MIA I don't know.
(smiling)
Perhaps he'll become a knight.KNIGHT Let me assure you, that's no pleasure either.MIA No, you don't look so happy.KNIGHT No.MIA Are you tired?KNIGHT Yes.MIA Why?
KNIGHT I have dull company.MIA Do you mean your squire?KNIGHT No, not him.MIA Who do you mean, then?KNIGHT Myself.MIA I understand.KNIGHT Do you, really?
MIA Yes, I understand rather well. I have often wondered why people torture themselves as often as they can. Isn't that so?She nods energetically and the KNIGHT smiles seriously. Now the shrieks and the noise from the inn become louder. Black figures flicker across the grass mound. Someone collapses, gets up and runs. It is JOF. MIA stretches out her arms and receives him. He holds his hands in front of his face, moaning like a child, and his body sways. He kneels. MIA holds him close to her and sprinkles him with small, anxious questions: What have you done? How are you?
What is it? Does it hurt? What can I do? Have they been cruel to you? She runs for a rag, which she dips in water, and carefully bathes her husband's
dirty, bloody face.
Eventually a rather sorrowful visage emerges. Blood runs from a bruise on his forehead and his nose, and a tooth has been loosened, but otherwise JOF seems unhurt.JOF Ouch, it hurts.MIA
Why did you have to go there? And of course you drank.MIA's anxiety has been replaced by a mild anger. She pats him a little harder than necessary.JOF Ouch! I didn't drink anything.MIA
Then I suppose you were boasting about the angels and devils you consort with. People don't like someone who has too many ideas and fantasies.JOF I swear to you that I didn't say a word about angels.MIA
You were, of course, busy singing and dancing. You can never stop being an actor. People also become angry at that, and you know it.JOF doesn't answer but searches for the armlet. He holds it up in front of MIA with an injured expression.JOF Look what I bought for you.MIA You couldn't afford it.JOF (angry)
But I got it anyhow.The armlet glitters faintly in the twilight. MIA now pulls it across her wrist. They look at it in silence, and their faces soften. They look at each other, touch each other's hands. JOF puts his head against MIA'S shoulder and sighs.JOF Oh, how they beat me.MIA Why didn't you beat them back?JOF I only become frightened and angry. I never get a chance to hit back. I can get angry, you know that. I roared like a lion.MIA
Were they frightened?JOF No, they just laughed.Their son MIKAEL crawls over to them. JOF lies down on the ground and pulls his son on top of him. MIA gets down on her hands and knees and playfully sniffs at MIKAEL.MIA Do you notice how good he smells?JOF And he is so compact to hold. You're a sturdy one. A real acrobat's body.He lifts MIKAEL up and holds him by the legs. MIA looks up suddenly, remembering the knight's presence.MIA Yes, this is my husband, Jof.JOF Good evening.KNIGHT Good evening.
JOF becomes a little embarrassed and rises. All three of them look at one another silently.
KNIGHT I have just told your wife that you have a splendid son. He'll bring great joy to you.JOF Yes, he's fine.
They become silent again.
JOF Have we nothing to offer the knight, Mia?KNIGHT Thank you, I don't want anything.MIA (housewifely)
I picked a basket of wild strawberries this afternoon. And we have a drop of milk fresh from a cow ...JOF ... that we were allowed to milk. So, if you would like to partake of this humble fare, it would be a great honor.MIA Please be seated and I'll bring the food.They sit down. MIA disappears with MIKAEL.KNIGHT Where are you going next?JOF Up to the saints' feast at Elsinore.KNIGHT I wouldn't advise you to go there.JOF Why not, if I may ask?KNIGHT The plague has spread in that direction, following the coast line south. It's said that people are dying by the tens of thousands.JOF Really! Well, sometimes life is a little hard.KNIGHT May I suggest ... (JOF looks at him, surprised)
... that you follow me through the forest tonight and stay at my home if you like. Or go along the east coast. You'll probably be safer there.MIA has returned with a bowl of wild strawberries and the milk, places it between them and gives each of them a spoon.JOF I wish you good appetite.KNIGHT I humbly thank you.MIA These are wild strawberries from the forest. I have never seen such large ones. They grow up there on the hillside. Notice how they smell!She points with a spoon and smiles. The KNIGHT nods, as if he were pondering some profound thought. JOF eats heartily.JOF Your suggestion is good, but I must think it over.MIA It might be wise to have company going through the forest. It's said to be full of trolls and ghosts and bandits. That's what I've heard.JOF (staunchly)
Yes, I'd say that it's not a bad idea, but I have to think about it. Now that Skat has left, I am responsible for the troupe. After all, I have become director of the whole company.MIA (mimics) After all, I have become director of the whole company.JONS comes walking slowly down the hill, closely followed by the GIRL. MIA points with her spoon.MIA Do you want some strawberries?JOF This man saved my life. Sit down, my friend, and let us be together.MIA (stretches herself) Oh, how nice this is.KNIGHT For a short while.
MIA Nearly always. One day is like another. There is nothing strange about that. The summer, of course, is better than the winter, because in summer you don't have to be cold. But spring is best of all.JOF I have written a poem about the spring. Perhaps you'd like to hear it. I'll run and get my lyre.He sprints towards the wagon.
MIA Not now, Jof. Our guests may not be amused by your songs.JONS (politely) By all means. I write little songs myself. For example, I know a very funny song about a wanton fish which I doubt that you've heard yet.The KNIGHT looks at him.JONS You'll not get to hear it either. There are persons here who don't appreciate my art and I don't want to upset anyone. I'm a sensitive soul.JOF has come out with his lyre, sits on a small, gaudy box and plucks at the instrument, humming quietly, searching for his melody. JONS yawns and lies down.KNIGHT People are troubled by so much.MIA It's always better when one is two. Have you no one of your own?KNIGHT Yes, I think I had someone.MIA And what is she doing now?KNIGHT I don't know.MIA You look so solemn. Was she your beloved?KNIGHT We were newly married and we played together. We laughed a great deal. I wrote songs to her eyes, to her nose, to her beautiful little ears. We went hunting together and at night we danced. The house was full of life ...MIA Do you want some more strawberries?KNIGHT (shakes his head)
Faith is a torment, did you know that? It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call.MIA I don't understand what you mean.KNIGHT Everything I've said seems meaningless and unreal while I sit here with you and your husband. How unimportant it all becomes suddenly.He takes the bowl of milk in his hand and drinks deeply from it several times. Then he carefully puts it down and looks up, smiling.MIA Now you don't look so solemn.KNIGHT I shall remember this moment. The silence, the twilight, the bowls of strawberries and milk,
your faces in the evening light. Mikael sleeping, Jof with his lyre. I'll try to remember what we have talked about. I'll carry this memory between my hands as carefully as if it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh milk.He turns his face away and looks out towards the sea and the colorless gray sky.KNIGHT And it will be an adequate sign -- it will be enough for me.He rises, nods to the others and walks down towards the forest. JOF continues to play on his lyre. MIA stretches out on the grass.The KNIGHT picks up his chess game and carries it towards the beach. It is quiet and deserted; the sea is still.DEATH I have been waiting for you.KNIGHT Pardon me. I was detained for a few moments. Because I revealed my tactics to you, I'm in retreat. It's your move.DEATH Why do you look so satisfied?KNIGHT That's my secret.
DEATH Of course. Now I take your knight.KNIGHT You did the right thing.DEATH Have you tricked me?
KNIGHT Of course. You fell right in the trap. Check!DEATH What are you laughing at?KNIGHT Don't worry about my laughter; save your king instead.DEATH You're rather arrogant.KNIGHT Our game amuses me.DEATH It's your move. Hurry up. I'm a little pressed for time.KNIGHT I understand that you've a lot to do, but you can't get out of our game. It takes time.DEATH is about to answer him but stops and leans over the board. The KNIGHT smiles.DEATH Are you going to escort the juggler and his wife through the forest? Those whose names are Jof and Mia and who have a small son?KNIGHT Why do you ask?DEATH Oh, no reason at all.
The KNIGHT suddenly stops smiling. DEATH looks at him scornfully.Immediately after sundown, the little company gathers in the yard of the inn.
There is the KNIGHT, JONS and the GIRL, JOF and MIA in their wagon. Their son, MIKAEL, is already asleep. JONAS SKAT is still missing.JONS goes into the inn to get provisions for the night journey and to have a last mug of beer. The inn is now empty and quiet except for a few farmhands and maidens who are eating their evening meal in a corner. At one of the small windows sits a lonely, hunched-over fellow, with a jug of brandy in his hands. His expression is very sad. Once in a while he is shaken by a gigantic sob. It is PLOG, the smith, who sits there and whimpers.JONS God in heaven, isn't this Plog, the smith?PLOG Good evening.JONS Are you sitting here sniveling in loneliness?PLOG Yes, yes, look at the smith. He moans like a rabbit.JONS If I were in your boots, I'd be happy to get rid of a wife in such an easy way.JONS pats the smith on the back, quenches his thirst with beer, and sits down by his side.PLOG Are you married?
JONS I! A hundred times and more. I can't keep count of all my wives any longer. But it's often that way when you're a traveling man.PLOG I can assure you that one wife is worse than a hundred, or else I've had worse luck than any poor wretch in this miserable world, which isn't impossible.JONS Yes, it's hell with women and hell without them. So, however you look at it, it's still best to kill them off while it's most amusing.
PLOG Women's nagging, the shrieking of children and wet diapers, sharp nails and sharp words, blows and pokes, and the devil's aunt for a mother-in-law. And then, when one wants to sleep after a long day, there's a new song -- tears, whining and moans loud enough to wake the dead.JONS nods delightedly. He has drunk deeply and talks with an old woman's voice.JONS Why don't you kiss me good night?PLOG (in the same way)
Why don't you sing a song for me?JONS Why don't you love me the way you did when we first met?PLOG Why don't you look at my new slip?JONS You only turn your back and snore.PLOG Oh hell!
JONS Oh hell. And now she's gone. Rejoice!
PLOG (furious) I'll snip their noses with pliers, I'll bash in their chests with a small hammer, I'll tap their heads ever so lightly with a sledge.PLOG begins to cry loudly and his whole body sways in an enormous attack of sorrow. JONS looks at him with interest.JONS
Look how he howls again.PLOG Maybe I love her.JONS So, maybe you love her! Then, you poor misguided ham shank, I'll tell you that love is another word for lust, plus lust, plus lust and a damn lot of cheating, falseness, lies and all kinds of other fooling around.PLOG
Yes, but it hurts anyway.JONS Of course. Love is the blackest of all plagues, and if one could die of it, there would be some pleasure in love. But you almost always get over it.PLOG
No, no, not me.JONS Yes, you too. There are only a couple of poor wretches who die of love once in a while. Love is as contagious as a cold in the nose. It eats away at your strength, your independence, your morale, if you have any. If everything is imperfect in this imperfect world, love is most perfect in its perfect imperfection.PLOG You're happy, you with your oily words, and, besides, you believe your own drivel.JONS Believe! Who said that I believed it? But I love to give good advice. If you ask me for advice you'll get two pieces for the price of one,"
tt0050986,"['Drama', 'Romance']","The movie opens when 78-year-old Isak Borg, played by Victor Sj√∂str√∂m, is in bed at home. He dreams about being on a city street with no other people present. A clock hanging above the street has no hands. Isak checks his pocket watch; it too has no hands. A figure appears with its back turned. Isak walks up to the figure and touches it. It has no face. The figure collapses onto the pavement. Blood streams out of the figure. Next a hearse drawn by a team of horses turns a corner and enters the street on which the dream-Isak is standing. It approaches Isak and then passes him but its rear wheel gets caught on a lamppost. Although no one is driving the hearse, the horses continue forward. The left rear wheel breaks off at the lamppost. The horses and hearse drive away but the coffin comes loose, and slides out and onto the street. A hand appears on the outside of the coffin. Isak looks at the hand. His hand and the hand outstretched from the coffin touch, with the hand coming out of the coffin holding Isak. The body in the coffin is also Isak. He awakes.The viewer senses the loneliness in Isak. And that Isak's time is running out. These are themes that come up again and again through the day.He leaves his bedroom to waken his maid Agda, played by Jullan Kindahl. Isak asks her to pack his suitcase and prepare breakfast for him. He has decided to drive to Lund, where he will later today receive an honorary doctorate as an award for his contributions to medicine. They squabble because they had previously planned to fly from Stockholm to Lund. While eating breakfast, Marianne, Isak's daughter-in-law, enters the breakfast room. She is played by Ingrid Thulin. Marianne has been staying at Isak's house, and asks if she can accompany Isak on the 300-mile drive from Stockholm to Lund. He agrees.They depart. Marianne tries to smoke but Isak objects. There is some tension in the car almost from the beginning of the trip. They manage to converse. Isak mentions that his son, Evald, owes his father money, and on principle is going to pay it back, a principle both father and son endorse. Marianne talks about her relationship with Evald, who, like his father, is a physician. A good deal is revealed, especially in a flashback that summarizes the conversation in the car. Her marriage to Evald (Gunnar Bj√∂rnstrand) is tense and unhappy. Evald is as rigid as Isak but Evald dislikes his father. Evald and Marianne quarreled sharply when she revealed to him that she was pregnant. He objected, and said he did not want children. Isak's marriage was also an unhappy one. At this particular juncture, the viewer develops a sense of the film's power of truth-telling.Isak decides to make a detour, and drives to the house where, during his youth, he spent many summers. One could find in the summer house his mother and father and 10 brothers and sisters as well as visiting cousins, uncles, and aunts. Marianne goes off to swim in the lake, leaving Isak alone. He walks up to a patch of wild strawberries (the Swedish title of the film better translates to ""wild strawberry patch""). Isak begins remembering his youthful days at the house and the land nearby. Flashbacks with Isak still in the scene show some of what life was like there long ago. His cousin Sara is picking wild strawberries to give to her deaf uncle as a birthday present when Sigfrid (Per Sj√∂strand), Isak's brother, arrives. Sigfrid helps her pick strawberries and flirts with her. They kiss. She is at first willing but then breaks away. She is too committed to the young Isak to continue the dalliance. Isak at that moment is away with his father fishing in the lake.At the lunch table, Isak's twin sisters, who are loud and naive, report on the interlude between Sara and Sigfrid, embarrassing Sara. One of the twins is played by director Ingmar Bergman's daughter. The older Isak looks in on the scene. Sara, upset, leaves the table, and is consoled by her aunt, with Isak looking on. Sara describes how she thinks Isak is too good for her. He is too upright. Sigfrid is more playful.The viewer learns that Isak was in love with Sara but ultimately she married his brother Sigfrid. Isak is the last of the 10 Borg children alive. Sara, Sigfrid's widow, is still alive and in her 70s.Near the house, a teenage girl and two boys come into the scene. One is her boyfriend and the other is a kind of chaperone. They are hitchhiking. Their ultimate destination is Italy. The girl, whose name is also Sara, is played by Bibi Andersson (Bibi Andersson and Ingrid Thulin have long been part of Bergman's company of players). Andersson also plays the Sara who was Isak's long-ago love. Of course, the present-Sara reminds Isak of his long-ago, and lost, Sara. The boys, Anders (Folke Sundquist) and Viktor (Bj√∂rn Bjelfvenstam), argue about the existence of God and other matters, and Sara tries to keep their arguments civil. Although one boy is closer to Sara than the other, the viewer gets the sense that both are interested in her, much the way Sigfrid and Isak were interested in the Sara of long ago but only one will succeed with her.Back on the road, a Volkswagon beetle comes hurtling around a bend, and nearly crashes into Isak's big old Packard. Isak's black car is reminiscent of a hearse. The VW turns over but the passengers are unhurt, physically that is. The man (Gunnar Sj√∂berg) and woman (Gunnel Brostr√∂m) in the car are a married couple almost out of Strindberg. The accident, the husband admits, was the result of driving while quarreling.Isak agrees to put the two in the car, and drive on toward Lund. The husband and wife are settled into jumper seats but continue to bicker. The husband needles the wife incessantly. She smacks him several times. Marianne, who is driving, stops the car, and orders the two to exit the car for the sake of the young people riding in the back.The car, now reduced to five travelers, stops at a service station that is run by a husband (Max von Sydow) and wife (Ann-Marie Wiman). Here we learn about another side of Isak. The couple is very happy to see Isak. Apparently long ago he worked some wonderful medicine to help the family. They admire him greatly, and absolutely refuse to let him pay for the gas or any of the work they did on the car. She is pregnant, and plans to name her child, if it is a son, Isak, after the doctor. Isak asks them to notify him when the child is born. He would like to be the child's godfather.They soon stop at a restaurant. The group has a delightful lunch at an outdoor terrace overlooking the beautiful Lake V√§ttern. Isak enjoys the company of the young people. The young people learn about Isak's award.There is another stop on the journey. At Isak's request, Marianne drives to the house of his ancient mother. Her house is en route. Marianne accompanies Isak into the house, and the young people remain in the car. Isak's mother is in her mid-90s and complains that she is always cold and that none of her grandchildren visit her. Mrs. Borg shows them some old artifacts from an earlier era, old toys and a pocket watch with no hands, the same pocket watch that appeared in Isak's dream at the beginning of the film. Later in the car, Marianne tells Isak how she is impressed by the mother's coldness. Marianne senses how that coldness runs through the family down to Evald.Isak falls asleep in the car while Marianne drives. He dreams that he is being given an examination by a professor of medicine. The professor is none other than the man Marianne asked to leave the car earlier that day. The cadaver he is to check is the man's wife but she isn't dead. Isak fails the examination. Perhaps it was not a medical school examination at all but an examination of how a lonely and aloof man lived his life. He awakes.The car has stopped. The young people have gone into a forest glen to gather flowers to make a bouquet for Isak. He is flattered by their attention.They reach Lund. Evald is in his home to greet them. Agda is there too although she was so angry in the morning that there was a chance she would not come. The three young people come. Isak, Marianne, and Evald dress for the ceremony which is an hour away. The young people plant themselves along the route of the processional to cheer Isak. The ceremony expresses great dignity and achievement, with many words uttered in Latin.Afterwards Isak is in Evald and Marianne's house although the viewer has the feeling that it is not going to be Marianne's house much longer. Isak tries to induce Agda to call him by his first name; after all they have known each other for 40 years. She declines.Isak is in bed in a second-floor bedroom. The young people serenade Isak from the garden below. He wishes them well as they got a lift to Hamburg and are closer yet to their goal of reaching Italy.Evald comes in. Isak wants Evald to forget about the debt. Isak also wants Evald and Marianne to reconcile. Marianne enters the room, and she and Isak have an affectionate exchange. The she heads off to party with Evald. The viewer gets a sense that Isak has to some extent broken through his loneliness and reconciled with the important people in his life."
tt0051003,"['Adventure', 'Biography', 'Drama', 'History']","On the night before his epic solo flight across the Atlantic, Charles Lindbergh () lies awake in his hotel bed, worrying about his chances. Will he have enough fuel? Will he even be able to take off? Rain falls outside his window, dimming the chances for an early start. Time is short, and Lindbergh knows he must make his attempt soon, because there are others trying to make the same flight.Tossing and turning, he thinks back to the events that led him here. Once, flying airmail for the Army, his plane failed in a Midwest blizzard, and after bailing out, he had to find his way through the dark and take a train to his destination. Lindbergh was no stranger to the dangers of flight, but his faith in its capabilities was unshakable, and a dream formed in his mind: he wanted to do something remarkable, something that would show people what airplanes could really do.Back at his home base in St. Louis, he calls a New York aircraft builder to get a quote on a special plane. One that can make a very long distance flight: New York to Paris, non-stop. Lindbergh next sets out to raise the money needed to buy it, and manages to get several St. Louis businessmen interested. They like the idea, and they see its value, but aren't sure about Lindbergh's chances. Is he really sure he can do this? He convinces them that he can, and the name ""The Spirit of St. Louis"" is coined for the project.Lindbergh travels to New York to purchase the special plane, but the deal falls through and he returns home, discouraged. Another possible builder is found however, and Lindbergh is off to California to see the small Ryan Aircraft Co. He locates the sleepy little factory and finds the firm's president Frank Mahoney () frying fish with a torch. Amused, Lindbergh makes the deal, and they all get to work. In a few weeks, a little silver plane has taken shape, and Lindbergh takes it up for testing. Satisfied, he heads back to St. Louis, but learns that another team has taken off from Paris and is trying to make it to New York. It seems as if Lindbergh is too late.Landing in St. Louis, he finds that the Frenchmen never arrived. Their attempt has failed, and they're probably dead. Against further misgivings from his backers, Lindbergh pushes on to New York to make his attempt but finds the weather has turned bad, and he's delayed days waiting for the rain to clear. So now he waits, laying in a hotel bed, unable to sleep.Finally giving up, he rises and prepares to leave. The weather forecast is improving, and Lindbergh wants to get away at the earliest possible moment. Frank Mahoney has come to help him, and together they drive out to the muddy airfield in the predawn dark, prepare the plane, and get ready to leave. A crowd of spectators has gathered to see Lindbergh, and they all walk out to the runway to watch. A marker has been placed down the runway to mark the point where Lindbergh must become airborne if he is to clear the trees at the end of the runway. The engine is fired, Lindbergh climbs into the cockpit, nervously shakes hands with Mahoney, and says ""Well, I might as well go.""Gunning the engine, the ground crew struggle to push the fully loaded plane forward through the mud. Slowly picking up speed, Lindbergh fights to keep going straight, and the ground crew fall back; he's on his own now. Bouncing and sloshing through the mud, the plane struggles to get into the air, but can't get enough speed. The marker flashes past but he's still not airborne, and when it seems far too late Lindbergh manages to lift sluggishly into the air. Scraping the treetops, he avoids an almost certain crash and clears the field. Lindbergh is finally on his way.Soon he is able to relax and settle into his routine, monitoring fuel and checking the map. However, after only a few hours he's exhausted, realizing he'd wasted last night in that bed. Now he faces a 30-hour-plus flight, all of this day and night and probably most of tomorrow. Fighting off drowsiness he continues to reminisce about the past, recalling other adventures: barnstorming, flying with an aerial circus, giving hair-raising flying lessons to a priest who had absolutely no talent for flight at all. As the day passes he flies along the coast of Newfoundland, reaching St. Johns before dark, and setting out over the trackless expanse of the North Atlantic.Fighting off sleep, he forces himself to stay awake through the night, but fails to notice that ice is building up on his wings; a deadly situation.
The plane shudders and begins to lose altitude, shaking Lindbergh awake. Unable to keep the plane flying, he prepares to ditch, but as he skims the waves, the warmer air near the surface melts the ice, shearing it off. Given a second chance, Lindbergh struggles on.As dawn comes, a bleary-eyed Lindbergh searches out over the waves for any signs of land. Having gone off course during the fight against the ice, he had no real idea of where he is. Hours pass. Deliriously tired, he sees white specks in the distance, and flying closer finds that they are seagulls. It's an encouraging sign. Next he spots a fishing boat and flies circles around it, cutting his engine and yelling at the astonished fisherman, ""Which way to Ireland?"" Getting no reply, Lindbergh flies on.Finally, he spots green shapes rising out of the sea, and these form into rocks and hills as he draws closer. Where is he? Iceland? North Africa? Checking the map, he is overjoyed to find that it is indeed the coast of Ireland, and he's very nearly on course after all. Waving happily to people as he finally passes over green land again, he turns southeast toward France.Passing over the French coast as night falls again, he follows the Seine River toward Paris, reaching the City of Light well after dark. Having pushed himself beyond all endurance, he is desperate to land, to get back on the ground again. The lights are confusing, and he's got to find the airport; he can't feel anything, and can't control the airplane any longer. Coming in at what he can only hope is the right direction, his wheels finally touch the ground of France. Coasting to a stop at the dark end of the airfield, he manages to reach up and cut the engine off, ending his flight. Lindbergh has done it.He is amazed to find a massive crowd rushing towards him. He's pulled from the plane by ecstatic Parisians, who give him a hero's welcome and carry him off on their shoulders. Charles A. Lindbergh has become the biggest hero of his time."

tt0051151,"['Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Horror']","The train has arrived in the small Mexican town of Sierra Negra. As
the workers unload a large box of soil from Bakonia, Hungary addressed to
Senor M Duval, Marta Gonzalez [Ariadna Welter] also gets off the train and looks around for
her Uncle Emilio [Jos√© Luis Jim√©nez], who was supposed to pick her up and escort her to the
Sicomoros (Sycamores), the Gonzalez family hacienda. Unfortunately, a
landslide has prevented the trains from running all afternoon, so Marta
wasn't expected until tomorrow and Don Emilio has gone home. Marta isn't
the only one with no ride from the station. Enrique [Abel Salazar] has been sitting
on a bench for hours, hoping to catch a ride. Just when it looks like
they'll have to remain at the station overnight, a wagon arrives to pick
up the box of soil. Enrique convinces the driver to give Marta and himself
a lift.When the driver has taken them as far as he will go, Marta and
Enrique are forced to walk the rest of the way along the dark, foggy,
lonely road, unaware that they're being followed by a woman dressed in a
flowing black gown. Marta is eager to return to the beautiful hacienda
where she grew up showered with love from Uncle Emilio and his two
sisters, Marta's aunts Eloisa [Carmon Montejo] and Mar√≠a Teresa [Alicia Montoya]...especially Marta's
beloved aunt Mar√≠a Teresa. Marta received a letter just two days ago from
Emilio, telling her that Mar√≠a Teresa was ill. Marta doesn't know it, but
Mar√≠a Teresa has already died and been interred in the family crypt. It's
for the best, explains Aunt Eloisa, the woman in black who was following
them on the road and who doesn't look like she's aged a day in the ten
years that Marta has been away. Mar√≠a Teresa has been sliding into
insanity for the past five years, convinced that there was a vampire in
the house who was after her blood. Night after night she would lock
herself in her room and surround herself with crucifixes to ward off the
vampires and with mirrors so that she could recognize a vampire by the
lack of a reflection.As unprepared as Marta was when she heard of her aunt's death, she is
equally as unprepared to see the once elegant hacienda in its current
state of deterioration. The one remaining manservant, Anselmo [Jos√© Ch√°vez], explains
that it is impossible to get workers because almost all the villagers have
left Sierra Negra. As there are no hotels operating in Sierra Negra,
Emilio invites Enrique to stay the night at the hacienda. Marta would be
surprised if she knew that Enrique is a doctor and that it was Emilio who
sent for him, hoping to have him assess Mar√≠a Teresa's state of mind, what
with her going on about vampires and all.What Emilio doesn't know is that there is, indeed, a vampire at the
hacienda. In fact, there are two. Eloisa has been turned into a vampire by
their neighbor, Senor Duval [Germ√°n Robles], and Eloisa wants to sell the hacienda to
Duval. Unfortunately, the agreement between the three siblings was that
the majority must rule for any sale to take place, and Emilio is against
selling. Now that Mar√≠a Teresa is dead and her share of the estate has
been passed to Marta, it is Marta who must cast the deciding vote. In
order to assure that Marta votes in favor of the sale, Duval and Eloisa
plan to make Marta a vampire, too. Now that the soil has arrived from
Hungary, it is also Duval's plan to revive his brother, Conde Karol de
Lavud [Lavud = Duval, get it?]. With Karol returned and possession of the
Gonzalez hacienda, the House of Lavud will rule again.That very night Duval pays a visit to the Gonzalez hacienda in order
to meet with Marta. Unfortunately, Marta feels exhausted from the day's
events and begs off. While readying herself for bed, Marta notices that
her aunt casts no reflection in the mirror, but she dismisses it as
tiredness. As Duval sits in the library talking with Emilio and Enrique,
they are surprised to see a book fall from a shelf, though no one was near
it. When Enrique goes to replace the book, he notices it open to a page
describing the murder of Conde Karol de Lavud, founder of the Sicomoros,
native of Bakonia, Hungary. Interested in this ancestor of the Sicomoros,
Enrique takes the book to his room. As he begins to page through the aged
text, he hears someone singing a lullaby and assumes it is Marta. During
the night, the ghosts are busy. Mar√≠a Teresa enters Marta's bedroom and
places a cross on her pillow. Eloisa sneaks into Enrique's room to rummage
through his luggage and finds his medical bag. Why would a doctor be here,
she wonders? Duval enters Marta's bedroom, but is thwarted by the cross on
her pillow...until her hand knocks it off. Then he pounces. First bite.The next morning, as Enrique prepares to leave for the train station,
he comes upon Marta seated in the courtyard, looking soulfully at a closed
door. It was my room when I was little, Marta explains. Mar√≠a Teresa would
sing her to sleep each night with a special lullaby that she made up.
Marta begins to sing it, and Enrique recognizes it as the same lullaby he
heard last night. Marta assures him that it could not be, because she
didn't sing it and the only other person who knows the song is dead.
Enrique opens the door to the bedroom and finds it, like the rest of the
courtyard, filled with dust and spiderwebs, but when Marta goes in to take
a look, she sees her dead aunt standing there and starts screaming. Emilio
comes running and is shocked to hear Marta describe Mar√≠a Teresa exactly
as she looked when she was laid in her coffin, with her hair loose and
carrying a crucifix. Emilio begs Enrique to stay for a few hours more.
Although anxious to get away from this madhouse, Enrique agrees.After Marta has had a chance to calm down, Eloisa informs her that Sr
Duval is coming for another visit. As Marta fixes her makeup, she again
notices that Eloisa casts no refection in the mirror. Knowing that she's
been found out, Eloisa invites everyone to have a drink of wine before
Enrique leaves for the train station. While pouring it, Eloisa places a
drug in Marta's wine. Enrique returns the book he was reading, explaining
that it's an interesting account of how Count Lavud was thought to be a
vampire by the villagers, so they staked him and buried him one hundred
years ago in the crypt. Legend says that a vampire must be buried alone;
if he is buried amongst others, another vampire will come looking for
revenge.Suddenly, Marta collapses. Dr Enrique examines her and pronounces her
dead. Hours pass. As the family keeps vigil over Marta's body, Anselmo
notices a twitch in her little finger. Enrique re-examines her and finds
that her pupils are constricted and that a mirror placed near her mouth
shows breath. Emilio says that Marta's ""death"" was similar to that of
Mar√≠a Teresa and wonders whether Mar√≠a Teresa might also have awakened
after being interred in her coffin. They rush down to the crypt and open
her coffin. It's empty! Anselmo and Maria (the maid) reveal that they
found a note in Mar√≠a Teresa's scapular just before being sealed in her
tomb. The note said: ""I'm not dead. Get me out of here, and take me to the
tunnel behind the cross."" This they did. Anselmo leads them into the
tunnel where they find Mar√≠a Teresa, alive and well. She explains how
Duval and Eloisa gave her a powder, just like it was given to Marta, to
make it look like she was dead so that she'd awaken in her coffin and die
of suffocation. They're vampires, she cries, and they're going to try and
revive Duval's brother. Emilio and Enrique begin to believe her.Meanwhile, Marta is reaching consciousness, only to see Duval
standing at the foot of her bed. Her screams bring Enrique, Emilio,
Anselmo, and Maria running, but Duval has carried Marta off through a
secret passage behind a bookcase. Emilio goes looking for a lantern, but
Enrique lights a candle and goes alone in search of Marta. A stone
staircase leads him down into a maze of tunnels which connect with the
crypt where Duval's coffin rests. Meanwhile, Eloisa attacks Emilio, biting
his neck. Then she tries to attack Enrique, but Mar√≠a Teresa grabs her
from behind and strangles her. Just as Duval is about to bite the again
unconscious Marta for the second time, Enrique bursts into the room. Duval
grabs a sword and attacks Enrique. Armed with a lighted torch, Enrique
fights off Duval's sword, until Duval succeeds in lobbing off the firey
head of the torch, which falls on the floor and starts some curtains on
fire. Just then, the cock crows. Duval races out of the room, leaving
Enrique to fight with two renfields while he jumps into his coffin. Maria
Teresa opens the coffin and drives a stake through Duval's heart. At that
moment, Marta awakens, Enrique overpowers the renfields and carries Marta
from the flames, and Eloisa turns to dust. Eventually, the flames envelope
Duval's coffin.Epiloque: The train has arrived in Sierra Negra. Enrique and Marta say
their goodbyes. The train pulls out of the station, but Enrique remains on
the platform, kissing Marta. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

His wife Rose is still awake, suffering from a toothache, and confides her anxiety about their inability to pay for having her tooth extracted. The couple, who are rearing two young boys, live frugally and have weathered their share of financial distresses. Remembering Rose's insurance policy, Manny suggests that they can borrow against it to pay for the procedure and plans to look into it when the office opens.Later, after promising to return at 5:30 to give music lessons to his sons, Manny visits his ailing father and then goes to the insurance company to see about the loan. Although he does not notice, the clerks become nervous in his presence and decide among themselves that he looks like the man who robbed them a month ago. The police, alerted by the insurance clerks, wait outside Manny's home and pick him up on his doorstep at 5:30. Without allowing him first to speak to his wife and without telling him why he is being taken into custody, they drive him to the station.There, after asking the bewildered Manny about his finances, the police conclude that he has a motive to steal money. They drive him to several stores that have been robbed in the past and ask the proprietors if he is the man who robbed them. When many of the victims express uncertainty about Manny being the thief, the police summon the insurance clerks to the station to identify him. To determine if his handwriting matches that of the robber, one of the detectives reads aloud a printed holdup note and asks Manny to print the words on a scrap of paper. Because Manny's printing is similar to the robber's, they ask him to print out a second sample. The second time, Manny, who has become increasingly frightened, misspells the word ""drawer"" as ""draw,"" which, coincidentally, is the same way the robber spelled the word. Based on this mistake and the tentative word of the witnesses, Manny is booked on charges of assault and robbery, fingerprinted and put in a cell for the night.Meanwhile, Rose, whom Manny has never been allowed to contact, worries that he has been in an accident, as he has never been late without calling. By the time the police notify Rose, Manny's mother and sister and brother-in-law, Gene and Olga Conforti, are waiting with her. The next morning, Manny is taken to the felony court in a police wagon with suspects of other crimes. A trial date is set, but despite his appointed attorney's request for leniency, the judge sets the bail at $7,500 and Manny is taken to the Queens County jail. After the Confortis manage to raise the money for Manny's bail, Rose calls lawyer Frank D. O'Connor, who has been recommended to Manny's mother.Although O'Connor warns that he has little experience with criminal cases, he takes the case, and urges Manny to recall where he was on the dates of the alleged robberies. On the date of the first robbery five months ago, the Balestreros recall that they were on vacation at a resort in Cornwall, New York, and at the time in question, Manny was playing cards with three other vacationers. Rose and Manny try to track down the three men, whose names they get from the resort owners, but one, a boxer, is never found and the two other men have died.Manny remembers that at the time of the second robbery he was suffering from a toothache, and his dentist confirms that his jaw was so swollen that dental work had to be postponed. O'Connor believes this might provide an alibi in court, as none of the witnesses reported that the robber had a swollen jaw. Rose becomes increasingly depressed, and begins to blame herself for Manny's problems, illogically concluding that it was because of her that Manny went to the insurance office to ask for a loan. When her behavior deteriorates into paranoia, Manny takes her to a doctor, who admits her to a sanitarium in Ossining.As Manny's trial begins, the witnesses are called to the stand to identify Manny as the robber. The incompetent O'Connor does very little to try to discredit or argue with the testimony. During O'Connor's half-hearted cross-examination of one witness , one of the jurors, who has already made up his mind about the case, asks the judge if they ""have to sit and listen to this?"" After a brief conference with O'Connor and the district attorney, the judge calls a mistrial after seeing the that majority of the jurors are bias against Manny and have concluded that he is the robber. O'Connor tells Manny that they will have to start over.Afterward, at home, Manny talks to his mother, who is taking care of the boys during Rose's absence, about his feeling of despair and she advises him to pray. Soon after, a man holds up a delicatessen. The owner signals to her husband, who approaches the robber from behind and holds him, while she phones the police. The robber is arrested and brought into the police station, where, in the hallway, he passes a detective working on Manny's case. Although the robber makes no initial impression on the detective, his resemblance to Manny soon strikes the latter, who follows up his hunch.Later, while performing at the Stork Club, Manny is summoned to the 110th precinct police station. When Manny arrives, the insurance clerks are there confirming that the robber is the same person who held them up. After identifying the correct man, they cannot meet Manny's eyes as they leave. The charges against Manny are dropped, but when he goes to Ossining to tell Rose, she is unresponsive. Manny leaves her there."

Credits and title follow. A narrator tells us, ""On April 10, 1945 units of the 72nd Squadron of the Royal Air Force crossed the boundary of Germany under the command of Canadian squadron leader Ted Stryker. Their mission: Penetrate enemy fighter cover and hold the formation intact for a vital incendiary raid on the German supply depots of Wiesbaden. At 0730, 12 miles from the target, enemy fighters were sighted directly ahead. Stryker led his planes to meet them."" An aerial dogfight ensues. Caught in fog, six of Stryker's men crashed into the German countryside. Five weeks later the war in Europe was over. Stryker (Dana Andrews) recovers in the Edinburgh Military Hospital, he has a head wound and a severe case of what is known today as PTSD. He is examined by a British Army Doctor (Willis Bouchey). Stryker blames himself for the deaths of his six comrades. The doctor suggests he face up to his decision and the consequences.CANADA 1956. Eleven years later at the Mid-Canadian Aircraft Co., Ltd. Jet Research, Winnipeg Division, Ted Stryker is talking to Frank Graham (Roy Gordon) about a job. Graham is reluctant to hire someone who has had 12 jobs in 10 years. He notes, ""And not one of them shows you can accept any responsibility."" Stryker confides that his marriage is on the rocks and he needs the job badly. Graham tells him he'll see what he can do. Feeling confident, Stryker brings home a bottle of champagne to celebrate with his wife, Helen (Linda Darnell). Ted searches the house but his wife is out. He finds a note on the counter. He crumples it up. He rushes to the airport only to find his wife boarding a DC-4 airplane. Aboard with Ellen is their son, Joey (Ray Farrell). Ted hastily buys a ticket and boards. The plane takes off in the dark. Ted has a death grip on the seat. He gets up and goes to the restroom. Looking out the window causes a flashback to the mission over Germany. Ted recovers, talks to the pilot, Capt. Bill Wilson (Elroy ""Crazylegs"" Hirsch), and then walks up the aisle to see his wife and son. Stewardess, Janet Turner (Peggy King) talks to one of the passengers. In fact they know each other. Tony Decker (Jerry Paris) apologizes to Janet for having to break a date at the last minute. Ted asks Janet if he can arrange a cockpit visit for his son, Joey. This will give Ted and Ellen a chance to talk. In the cockpit, the copilot, Walt Stewart (Steve London) reminds the captain that the temperature is going up on Engine #3. Janet, Ted and Joey enter the cockpit. Janet informs the captain that she'll be serving dinner soon--the choice is grilled halibut or lamb chops. Both pilots request the fish. Joey asks for fish and his father Ted requests the lamb. Capt. Wilson calls for a weather report and is told, ""Looks like snow and ice crystals around Regina."" Most likely some fog in an hour or two for Calgary.Ted returns to Joey's seat to talk to Ellen. Ellen reminds Ted of eleven years of different cities, different jobs and the change in his personality. She concludes, ""I can't live with a man I don't respect. Joey leaves the cockpit as Janet brings the copilot his dinner. Janet starts to pick up the meal trays from those passengers who have finished their dinner. Joey takes his dad's seat and is amused by Janet's boyfriend, Tony Decker. He puts a sock puppet on his hand and amuses Joey. Janet brings Joey his dinner. A woman passenger (Maxine Cooper) complains, ""My stomach. I never felt anything like it before. Help me. Please help me."" Janet calls Capt. Wilson to report a sick passenger. The pilot suggests Janet quietly find a doctor on board. The copilot is now feeling queasy and sweating. Janet finds a doctor, Dr. Baird (Geoffrey Toone) and asks him to see one of the passengers. Ted approaches Janet and Dr. Baird and tells them his son is also sick. The doctor examines the sick woman passenger. Baird tells Janet, ""You better tell the captain. We've got to land. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital."" Next the doctor examines Joey and asks Ellen what he's eaten in the last 24 hours. The doctor speaks to the captain about landing. The plane goes into a steep dive and the captain returns to the cockpit. He finds the copilot slumped over the controls. The doctor removes the copilot from his seat as the captain resumes the controls. The doctor concludes the common denominator is food. Janet tells the doctor that both Joey and the copilot had fish. Another passenger (John Zaremba) tells Janet his wife is sick. She asks if she had fish or lamb for dinner. He tells her, ""We both had fish, why?"" The captain tells the doctor, ""I just remembered something. I ate fish too."" The captain declares an emergency with air traffic control and asks for priority into Vancouver.The doctor gives the captain a shot of morphine. The ground controllers discuss the options available. Just as everything seems ok, Capt. Wilson gets sick. He sets the automatic pilot then collapses. The doctor asks Janet, ""Is there anybody else on board who can land this plane and who didn't have fish for dinner?"" He proposes a ruse of asking if someone can help with the radio. Janet asks Ted. He goes up to the cockpit, sees the doctor, and then sees no one is flying the plane. The doctor asks, ""Can you fly this airplane and land it?"" Ted replies, ""No, not a chance."" The doctor makes it clear. Every passenger who is sick may die unless Ted can fly and land the airplane. They have about two hours. Ted reluctantly takes the controls.Ellen joins Ted in the cockpit. The doctor gives it to her straight. Both pilots are sick and Ted is their only hope. Ellen is recruited as co-pilot. Her job will be to handle the radio and talk to the ground controllers, leaving Ted free to fly the airplane. Ted calls Mayday and ground controllers clear the airspace around them. Ted informs the controllers that he's only flown a single engine fighter during the war, and hasn't been in an airplane for 10 years.Vancouver air traffic controllers make arrangements to get Capt. Treleaven. He flew with Stryker during the war and knows him inside out. Ted tells Ellen to take over the radio. They try to reach Treleaven at home but are told he and his wife are at a nightclub. They reach him there and tell him to come to the airport at once. Treleaven arrives at the airport and talks to Harry Burdick (Charles Quinlivan). He tells Burdick that he and Stryker have a history and perhaps someone else should talk to Stryker. The radio dispatcher in Vancouver (Larry Thor) informs Burdick reception is good with Flight 714 and they can take over.Treleaven calls Ted and introduces himself. It is obvious they dislike each other. Ted unlocks the auto pilot to get the feel of the airplane. He practices a few shallow turns. When asked about the weather, Ellen tells the ground, ""Rain and a little ice."" Ted climbs to 11,000 feet. They are now about the clouds and bad weather. A hysterical woman passenger panics (Fintan Meyler) and must be calmed. Ted practices slower airspeed at 120 knots, 20 degrees of flaps and landing gear down. The lightning triggers his PTSD and he flashes back to the failed mission. Only his wife telling him his airspeed is off returns him to concentrate on flying. Ted recovers the airplane, but a startled passenger opens the cockpit door and discovers Ted flying the plane. ""Look, he isn't a pilot,"" the startled man shouts. The doctor comes clean with the passengers. Unfortunately Ted descended too low near the mountains, and the radio reception is lost. Repeated calls to the ground go unanswered. Ted adjusts the frequency to regain contact. Vancouver controllers contact Capt. Wilson's wife, Joan (Patricia Tiernan, credited as Carole Eden) and tell her to get to the airport. Radar finally picks up Flight 714 and he changes course to the airport. Ted begins a slow descent, but the weather is getting worse at Vancouver. A local newspaper prepares two headlines for the next day's edition, ""Airline Disaster Here"" and ""38 Airline Passengers Survive Mid-Air Peril.""Ellen goes back to see Joey and Dr. Baird goes up to see Ted. Bad news, the fog's getting thicker at Vancouver and Ted is about 30 miles out at 2500 feet altitude. Treleaven and Burdick head for the tower for Ted's final approach and landing. Joan arrives in the tower to be briefed on her husband's flight and his condition. At 1000 feet and nearing the airport Ted again experiences flashbacks. Ted decides to land now, rather than circle and wait for the weather to get better. Ellen tells him, ""Ted, I just wanted you to know now...I'm very proud."" Emergency equipment is on the field and waiting. Ted finally sees the approach and runway lights. The passengers brace for impact. Ted is coming in too fast. He touches down and jumps on the brakes and cuts the engines. The airplane slides to one side and the landing gear snap off. The DC-4 slides to a stop and emergency equipment rushes to the scene. Treleaven calls Ted and tells him, ""Ted, that was probably the lousiest landing in the history of this airport. But there are some of us here, particularly me that would like to buy you a drink and shake your hand."" Ted and Ellen exit the cockpit.

Juan Contreras (Armando Calvo), her ex-manager and lover, find her singing at a modest theater in a variety show where people ignore how great she was. Mar√≠a and Juan have an emotional reunion in her dressing room and start reminiscing about a glorious and turbulent past.(Flashback) They first met over forty years earlier in Madrid when Juan was an influential show business promoter and Maria just a chorus girl dreaming of stardom. She lived modestly with her aunt Paca (Matilde Mu√±oz Sampedro) and was engaged to C√°ndido Chamorro (Jos√© Moreno) who worked at a watch repair shop. C√°ndido doesn't approve of Mar√≠a's singing aspirations and crashes constantly with Paca who is convinced that Mar√≠a's voice is their ticket out of poverty. Meanwhile, Juan has noticed Mar√≠a in the chorus line and offers to finance her career as a cupl√© singer but she refuses the offer in order to please C√°ndido. Besides, Mar√≠a hates the cupl√©s which are the pop songs of the day, most of them full of double meanings and sex references. When Mar√≠a and Paca can't pay the rent of their humble flat, C√°ndido steals money from the shop and lands in jail. Desperate, Mar√≠a asks Juan to bail him out and in exchange commits to a cupl√© singing contract with him. C√°ndido is released but soon realizes that he has nothing to offer Mar√≠a so he volunteers for the Army. The day of her singing debut, Mar√≠a receives a farewell letter from C√°ndido along with his Army sign-in bonus to repay Juan. Masking her broken heart with a sexy happy tune, Mar√≠a goes on stage and has a tremendous success.As time passes Mar√≠a conquers every city in Spain becoming the singing sensation of the time. The cupl√©s in her voice seem to gain a respectability that was never there before. Soon she is singing in Paris where she is received like a goddess. The masses adore her and the men are all at her feet including a drunken Russian noble (Alfredo Mayo) who tries to force himself upon her. Juan intervenes and ends up wounded in a duel with the Russian. Mar√≠a realizes that Juan truly loves her and, moved with gratitude, swears eternal love to him.

She is now wealthy and world famous but somewhat bored. At a street fair she encounters Pepe Molina, (Enrique Vera) an aspiring bullfighter and there's an instant attraction between the two. It doesn't matter that Mar√≠a is a 30-something mature woman while Pepe is barely 19 years old. They fall in love and start a torrid romance that is soon the scandal of the day. Maria uses her money and influence to advance Pepe's career and he soon becomes a famous bullfighter. Both Juan and Aunt Paca are disgusted by this turn of events but Maria sees this as her last chance for true love and happiness. She is willing to fight everybody including Pepe's childhood sweetheart Trini (Juanita Mart√≠nez) who begs her to leave him alone. Mar√≠a pays no attention even when it is obvious that Pepe is playing with both women.Destiny puts an end to it all when the bullfighter is killed in the arena as Mar√≠a watches.

Mar√≠a Lujan is finally back in the big time. She sings a cupl√© about a love cut short by death and gets visibly emotional. At the end of the song, while the public applauds wildly, she collapses in Juans arms. Backstage he tries to revive her but Maria is dead.

While loading food and water, a magician named Sokourah (5) (Torin Thatcher) emerges from a mask-crowned stone portal, chased by a Cyclops with satyr's legs (created as a stop-motion model, like most of the non-human cast, by Ray Harryhausen). The wizard rubs a magic lamp and is helped by a boy genie, Baronni (Richard Eyer), (6) who creates a magic barrier between the Cyclops and Sinbad's crew, who escape, taking Sokourah with them. But the Cyclops throws a rock to sink their boat, and the lamp is lost: the Cyclops recovers it from the shallow surf.Now at sea, Sokourah tries to persuade Sinbad with a bagful of jewels into returning to Colossa to regain the magic lamp; but Sinbad's mission is to go to Bagdad and avert war with Chandra by marrying Parisa. Once in Bagdad, Sokourah tries to convince the Caliph (Alec Mango), to grant him a ship for an expedition to Colossa, also showing him designs for a giant crossbow. But the Caliph listens to Sinbad about the perils of returning to Colossa, and even after putting on a fantastic magic show during a feast for the Caliph and Parisa's father, the Sultan of Chandra (Harold Kasket), during which Sadi is transformed into a blue four-armed snake-woman which performs an exotic dance, Sokourah's request is denied. Sokourah then prophesies war between Chandra and Baghdad, which upsets the Caliph and the Sultan, and Sokourah is banished from the city.Sokourah steals into Parisa's bedchamber at night, and enchants her with the green smoke of a magic candle, which shrinks Parisa down to a few inches high. In the morning, Sadi discovers her and calls for the Caliph, Sinbad, and the Sultan: the Sultan becomes infuriated, vowing to avenge Parisa by laying waste to Bagdad.Sinbad seeks out Sokourah, and implores him to restore Parisa to her normal size, being apparently unaware that Sokourah was responsible for her miniaturization. Sokourah initially feigns helplessness, but finally concedes he can restore the Princess but he needs as a vital ingredient a piece of eggshell from the Roc (7), a giant bird that nests on the peaks of the Isle of Colossa. Sinbad now agrees to the voyage, and musters a crew partly from the condemned men from the Caliphs prison - a murderous rabble whose loyalty is questionable. Parisa journeys with Sinbad in a jeweled casket, and the giant crossbow is also made and loaded aboard.The crew mutiny once out at sea, and force Sinbad to yield by threatening Sokourah. They then lock up Sinbad, his loyal crew member Harufa and Sokourah, who curses the crew with madness: he knows that a storm will drive the ship towards rocks south of Colossa inhabited by wailing demons whose screams are unbearable: Sinbad saves his and his companions sanity by using waxed cloth to block their ears. The mutiny ringleader dies in a fall from the mast, and the men release Sinbad to save the ship. The ship and a more obedient crew arrive at Colossa.As the giant crossbow is assembled on the beach in front of the stone mask, Sinbad and Sokourah each lead a party through the Valley of the Cyclops, with Sinbad secretly (for a few minutes, at least) followed by his lieutenant, Harufa. Sinbads band discovers a giant spiked club and a store house full of treasure; though Sinbad tries to stop them, they become greedy trying to seize it: a Cyclops discovers them, hauls all five of them out, and locks them in a cage, from which it extracts Harufa whom it ties to a roasting-spit and starts to barbecue. Sokourah hears the shouts of Sinbad and the other trapped men, but does not release them, instead entering the treasure-chamber to find the magic lamp. Sinbad now reveals the tiny Princess Parisa, who manages to unfasten the cage's latch, enabling Sinbad and the men to escape. The four men who were with Sokourah, having become drunk on a stream flowing with wine, now attack: the Cyclops kills two by squashing them with an uprooted tree. During the following fight Sinbad manages to free Harufa, seize the lamp from Sokourah, and kill the Cyclops by first blinding him with a burning stake from the fire, and then leading him over a cliff, where the Cyclops falls to his death in the stream below.Sinbad is now suspicious of Sokourah, and refuses to let him have the lamp until Sokourah restores Parisa to her normal size. Sinbad, Sokourah, Harufa and the remaining three crewmen all climb a steep, rocky mountain (losing one man who falls off en route), until they find a giant egg. The two hungry crewmen break the egg with axes, releasing a two-headed yellow-down-covered Roc hatchling, which they kill and roast: Sinbad takes some of the eggshell. Parisa enters the lamp to speak with the genie, where he reveals to her his name, the magic words needed to use the lamp, which she passes onto Sinbad, and a prophecy which would free the genie to become, as he desires, a real boy - ""into fiery rock, to rise, you must fall"".Shortly an adult Roc appears, attacks the crew, knocking the two remaining crewmen off the mountain to fall to death, and carries Sinbad, unconscious, off to its nest. Sokourah seizes the opportunity to kill Sinbad's right-hand man Harufa with a spear, and takes Parisa prisoner. Sinbad escapes from the Roc's nest, and summoning the genie of the lamp, discovers that Parisa is being held in Sokourah's castle in a cave at the foot of the mountain. This is guarded by a chained wingless green fire-breathing horned Dragon, which Sinbad must bypass by winding in its chain on one of a pair of windlasses.At Sokourah's castle, Sinbad orders Sokourah at the point of a sword to restore Parisa to normal. Using the prepared potion, the piece of eggshell, and an incantation, Sokourah fills a large chest, into which the Princess has been placed, with green smoke, and Parisa becomes normal size again. However, Sinbad refuses to give up the lamp until he and the Princess are safely back at his ship: enraged, Sokourah animates a skeleton which, armed with scimitar and shield, fights Sinbad, he ultimately defeating it by pushing it off the top of a spiral staircase. Sokourah tries again to stop Sinbad and Parisa escaping by magically smashing a rock bridge over a channel of molten lava: the genie, summoned, helps them by materializing a rope they use to swing across the chasm to safety.Parisa realizes the chasm is the ""fiery rock"" mentioned in the prophecy of release for the genie, and casts the lamp into the lava flow, infuriating Sokourah. Sinbad and Parisa manage to sneak their way past Sokourah's guard Dragon, but another Cyclops enters the cave and blocks their way. Sinbad releases the Dragon by cutting the ropes of the windlass, enabling it to break its chain; the Dragon then fights and kills the Cyclops, biting its throat out. Sokourah follows shortly after, and with his dragon, chases Sinbad and Parisa back to the stone mask, where the giant crossbow is used to shoot the Dragon, which falls onto Sokourah, presumably killing him: the Dragon drags itself to the beach before expiring.As Sinbad and Parisa escape, back on board ship, Parisa calls Baronni by name he reappears, now a genie no longer but Sinbads cabin boy who has also thoughtfully filled Sinbad's cabin with the Cyclops' treasure, as a ""sort of a wedding present"".Notes (1) Spelling uncertain: historically, 'Chandra' is a Hindu lunar deity (2) This spelling of 'Parisa' is used p163 in 'The Art of Ray Harryhausen', by Ray Harryhausen and Tony Dalton, 2006, Billboard Books, New York (3) This spelling of 'Bagdad' rather than 'Baghdad' is used as a text overlay in the film, although the video sleeve has 'Baghdad' (and so may be unreliable on other points) (4) This spelling of 'Colossa' is used p162 in 'The Art of Ray Harryhausen' (5) Spelt 'Sokourah' in 'The Art of Ray Harryhausen' p 162 et. seq., and so used here, although the video sleeve has 'Sokurah': the role is not given in the title credits (6) Spelling uncertain, and could also be 'Birani' or any phonetic variant: in the title credits simply 'The Genie' (7)The roc or rukh is a giant bird in Persian mythology, probably inspired in part by the eggs or even sightings of the Aepyornis elephant bird, a now-extinct three-metre-tall flightless bird of Madagascar, for which there were reported sightings at least in folklore memory recorded in 1658. The eggs were known at least as early as 1420, according to a caption in the 1456 Fra Mauro map: Marco Polo also gave an account of the rukh in 1298.(Original version)The film begins with Sinbad and his crew sailing through a thick fog. They are enroute to Bagdad, returning from the Kingdom of Chandra with special booty, the Princess Parisa and her handmaid, Sadi. The ship must stop for supplies at the Island of Colossus. While loading supplies, a wizard named Sokurah emerges from a cave, chased by a cyclops. The wizard rubs a lamp and is helped by a boy genie. Sinbad's crew narrowly escapes the cyclops, taking Sokurah with them. But, the lamp is lost to the sea during the escape. The gigantic cyclops recovers its precious lamp from the shallow surf.Now at sea, Sokurah tries to bribe Sinbad into returning to Colossus and retaking the magic lamp, but Sinbad's primary mission is to go to Bagdad and avert war with Chandra by marrying Parisa. Once in Bagdad, Sokurah tries to convince Sinbad's uncle the Caliph to lend him a ship for an expedition to Colossus. But, the Caliph listens to Sinbad, and even after putting on a fantastic magic show before the Caliph of Bagdad and Parisa'a father, the Sultan of Chandra, Sokurah 's request is denied. During Sokurah's performance, he prophesies war between Chandra and Bagdad. The dark prophecies upset the Caliph and the Sultan, and Sokurah is bannished from the city.Sokurah steals into Parisa's bedchamber at night, and enchants her with the smoke of a magic candle, which shrinks Parisa down to the size of a small bird. In the morning, Parisa's handmaid discovers her enchantment. The Caliph, Sinbad, and Parisa's father the Sultan are shocked. The Sultan blames Bagdad, and becomes infuriated. He vows to avenge Parisa by laying waste to Bagdad.Sinbad seeks out Sokurah, and implores him to restore Parisa to her normal size. He is unaware, at this point, that Sokurah commited the treachery. Sokurah feigns helplessness, but finally concedes he may be able to help restore the Princess by using the egg shell from the Roc, a giant bird that lives on the Isle of Colossus. Sinbad agrees. He musters a crew from the prison. These are murderous, lecherous rabble whose loyalty is questionable.The crew proves unreliable once out at sea, where they mutiny and lock up Sinbad, crew and the magician Sokurah. Before they are locked in the hold, Sokurah curses the crew with a storm and madness. His curse plays out when a storm and the unbearable wail of sirens drives the crew mad. In their madness, they release Sinbad and his men to save the ship. The ship and a more obedient crew arrive at Colossus.The crew discover a store house full of treasure, and become greedy. Sinbad finds the magic lamp. The cyclops discovers them, and locks them in cages. It is soon learned the cyclops eats men. Sokurah has the opportunity to release the caged men, but leaves them behind without explanation. Sinbad reveals the tiny Princess Parisa to the men, who were unaware of her presence in a tiny tent crafted by the Royal Jeweler. Parisa manages to unfasten the cage's latch, and all escape. Parisa enters the lamp to speak with the genie, where he reveals to her his name and the magic words needed to use the lamp.Sinbad is now suspicious of Sokurah's intentions, but catches up with him. The magician is still needed to restore Parisa to her normal size. All the men climb a steep, rocky mountain, where they find pieces of the Roc's shell. The hungry men resort to killing a two-headed Roc hatchling for food. Later, while roasting the gigantic chick, the mother Roc appears, and carries Sinbad off to its nest. Sokurah seizes the opportunity to kill Sinbad's right-hand man Harufa, and takes Parisa. Sinbad escapes from the Roc's nest, and using the lamp, discovers that Parisa is being held in Sokurah's fortress in a cave.Sinbad finds the cave, and Parisa. He orders Sokurah at the point of a sword to restore Parisa to normal. Using the piece of shell and an incantation, Parisa becomes normal size again. But, Sokurah will not let Sinbad go with the lamp, and enchants a skeleton to life. Sinbad fights the skeleton, defeating it. He and Parisa narrowly escape Sokurah's chambers. There is another obstacle before them, a fiery chasm. The genie, whose name we learn is Baronni, helps Sinbad and Parisa one final time, by materializing a rope they use to swing across the chasm to safety.In an unselfish act, Parisa takes the lamp and casts it into the chasm of fire, for she recalls a promise of freedom, which read, ""Into the fire you must go."" Sinbad and Parisa manage to sneak their way past Sokurah's guard dragon, but another cyclops enters the cave and blocks their way. Sinbad helps the dragon to escape its iron collar, and the dragon and cyclops engage in battle. Sinbad and Parisa escape the cave, and the dragon kills the cyclops. Sokurah follows shortly after, and with his dragon, chases Sinbad, Parisa and the crew.The crew have one more weapon, a giant crossbow, which was originally intended for the cyclops. The crew unleash the arrow on the dragon, which falls to its death, also crushing Sokurah. The crew escape. Parisa is restored, but they have no lamp. Parisa affectionately remembers Baronni, and mentions his name.""Did someone call Baronni? Here I am!"" It is Baronni, no longer the genie, but Captain Sinbad's cabin boy. In his final act of magic, Baronni fills Sinbad's cabin with the Cyclops' treasure, ""as a sort of a wedding present."" The ship is safely on its way back to Bagdad."

A police officer approaches a parked car and questions the occupant (Uchida) before moving on. A second man(Misaki) appears and begins to load something into the back of the car. Misaki suddenly screams in pain and begins firing his gun. Panicked, Uchida drives off leaving Misaki struggling in the middle of the street before being hit by a taxi. The driver of the taxi jumps out to investigate. Instead of a body all he finds is a complete set of clothes laying in the street.The next day at the local police station, narcotics are found among the missing mans belongings. We are told that Misaki got the drugs from a locker rented by Mr Chin. Chin identifies the man who gave him the drugs. It is Misaki. The police go to Misakis apartment to arrest him but only find his wife, Chikako, a night club singer.
Chikako agrees to go with the police, but tells them nothing, explaining she has not seen him for days, and had no idea what he did for a living. Ultimately the police dont believe her, but let her go in the hope of drawing Misaki out of hiding.While performing at the club a strange man makes contact with Chickako, he wants information about Misaki. The police arrest the man who turns out to be Dr Masada, a highly respected scientist. He explains he is doing research into the after effects of atomic explosions, he has a theory that the night Misaki disappeared, the rain may have been radioactive and Misaki actually dissolved. He also thinks that Misaki may have been on a Japanese ship that strayed too close to an atomic test conducted on Bikini or Christmas Island.Arriving home that night Chikako is attacked by a gangster from a rival gang looking for Misaki. Chikako watches the gangster leave through an open window. She screams and faints as we hear a cut of scream and a number of gunshots. Investigating, the police find yet another complete set of clothes but no body. The police remain unconvinced that Chikako is innocent, but let her remain free all the same.Dr Masada explains to the police that he has heard stories before of men dissolving, and that he has eyewitnesses to such an event. The witnesses - two fishermen relate a story of encountering a ship abandoned at sea. They board the vessel with a group of 5 other men. The ship appears in good order however during their explorations they discover no evidence of the crew other than piles of abandoned clothes
While investigating the captains cabin, one of the fishermen remains behind to steal some of the clothes. A watery mass erupts out of the darkness dissolving him, leaving only his clothes. The remaining men attempt to escape as more of the watery masses appear.Only two make it back to their original ship. The Captain does not believe their story till he and the rest of the crew see strange green shapes moving around on the strange vessel. Reaching port they tell the authorities of the strange encounter and hand in a log book they picked up. Masada has the log book and reads a number of entries that seem to confirm his theory about the atomic blast being able to melt people.Masada then shows the police an experiment he has been working on that seems to show intense radiation can melt objects. He exposes a frog to the radiation which dissolves as predicted. Masada further demonstrates that despite its current state, the frog is still capable of killing things and absorbing them
Chikako is convinced after what she saw that Misaki is dead, killed in similar fashion to the fishermen. The pieces come together as Masada realizes part of the abandoned ship have washed into Tokyo harbor, and the creatures themselves must be loose in Tokyo.Chikako admits she has had enough of the police harassment and offers to point out the main gangster at the club she sings at. The police surround the building then begin sending plain clothes officers inside. Some of the criminals realize something is wrong and attempt to leave, only to be rounded up by the officers.Two gangsters escape through the clubs dressing rooms, only to be cornered and killed by the creatures. Another creature appears in Chikakos dressing room and throughout the rest of the building gunfire can be heard as more of the creatures, now labeled H-men begin go to invade the property.Masada arrives at the club just as the H-men begin to leave. The police search the building and account for all the gangsters either dead or alive. Mistakenly they think Uchida has also died, however he simply removed his clothes and escaped into the night.Dr Maki (Masada's boss) shows the police a second experiment with the frog that proves the creatures are not simply killing their victims but eating them as well. Maki releases his findings to press as well as admitting the existence of the H-men. Plans are drawn up to use a combination of electricity and fire to destroy the creatures that are believed to be living now in the sewers under the city.Chikako is kidnapped by Uchida and the couple get caught up in a car chase when Masada realizes the situation. Masadas car crashes and the couple speed off. Abandoning the car, Uchida leads Chikako to a hidden stash of heroine in the sewers, which is very close to the lair of the H-men. As the couple return to the surface they see some of the H-men. Uchida orders Chakako to remove her clothes in the hope the police will think she has also been killed.Masada, figures out where Chikako might be when he finds her clothes close to a sewer exit in the river. He begins working his way through the tunnels racing against time as preparations are nearly completed by the authorities to begin their assault.Uchida now lost in the tunnels is attacked and killed by the H-men.

They drive out to try to find where the meteor landed. An old man (Olin Howland) has heard the meteor crash near his house. He finds the meteor and pokes it with a stick. The rock breaks open to reveal a small jelly-like blob inside. This Blob, a living creature, crawls up the stick and attaches itself to his hand. Unable to scrape or shake it loose (and apparently now in pain), the old man runs hysterically onto the road, where he is seen by Steve, who takes him to see the local doctor, Doctor Hallen.They reach the clinic when Doc Hallen is about to leave. Hallen anesthetizes the man and sends Steve back to the crash site to gather more information. Hallen decides he must amputate the man's arm which is being consumed by the Blob, calling in his nurse. However, the Blob completely consumes the old man. Now an amorphous creature, it eats the nurse and the doctor while increasing in size.Steve and Jane return to the office and Steve witnesses the doctor's death.

Defending themselves inside, the diner's owner uses a CO2 fire extinguisher attempting to put out the fire, which also causes the approaching Blob to recoil. Steve remembers that the Blob retreated from the refrigerator, too, and tells Lt. Dave that the Blob apparently cannot stand the cold (""CO2, Dave, CO2!""). Jane's father, Mr. Martin (Elbert Smith), takes Steve's friends to the high school to retrieve fire extinguishers which are used to freeze the Blob. Dave requests an Air Force jet to transport the Blob to the North Pole to keep it frozen. A military plane is shown dropping the Blob into an Arctic landscape.

He insists, so she threatens him by showing off a gun. At that moment, the bar owner arrives, dressed up to the nines. He tries to force Bonnie, so she throws him down the stairs, while Guy keeps himself hidden, listening. Guy tells Bonnie that she would like working as a whore in some seedy street corner if she doesn't leave with him - the hint is that the cook is dead. Guy says this while holding a tommy-gun.Wichita Fall, Texas: Bonnie and Guy wait until it's about closing time to rob a bar. Whey they have taken all the money from the till, they shoot all over the place reducing the bar to debris, although the bar patron himself is not hurt. They run away in a car and they don't pay at a small town's oil station. They also blow the place up. Guy drives off while she tries to kiss him, completely turn-on. As he swirls from one side of the road to the other, a patrolman follows them. She shoots him and kills him.The police cannot catch them. Tom Steel, a Texas Ranger (Douglas Kennedy) discusses the case with his secretary Mary (Madeline Foy). Why would any woman behave like that?

Somebody suggests that he should follow the coupe of criminals wherever they go.Meosho, Missouri: Bonnie and Guy have rented a cheap countryfarm cottage. He looks at her lusting for her while she's having a bath. Guy's big brother phones them. Chuck Darrow (Joe Turkel) arrives with her girl (Patt ""Patricia"" Huston). Chuck has thought about a job. Guy doesn't want to know anything about it, but Bonnie wants to get real big money.

Duke gets the gun, and Bonnie helps him run away, leaving some casualties. Duke gets hurt in a leg. Hidden in a cottage, Bonnie, Duke and Guy make huge robberies, many times killing people. Bonnie doesn't want to have anything to do with any of the gang-members sentimentally or sexually. She has her private room hidden behind a curtain. Duke tiptoes into the room while she's sleeping, but she's left some crystal on the floor so that he shouts in pain. She wakes up and tells him to go away.Hidden away once again, Bonnie knows a guy while Guy and Duke are away. Paul Baxter (William Stevens) is an attractive night-school Architecture student. She feels attracted to him, among other things because he says he wants to build, create things and buildings.The little boy's scene is good fun: A cute little boy (Stanley Livingston) had taken the keys from the gang's open car. He threatens the three of them with a toy gun. Bonnie insists to the other two that they must not hurt the boy.

Bonnie gives him the chewing-gum in exchange of the keys.They go to rob a money van. They make the van get stuck in the mud. When one of the guards leave to try to move it on, the criminals start shooting. A group of scouts appear, led by a comically cowardly fatty man (Sydney Lassick). Bonnie prevents Duke from shooting them, so the scouts run away. The armoured lorry guard (Bob Steel) leaves the van when Bonnie puts fire to the petrol pump. They run away just as the local sheriff sppears shooting. Only Guy and Bonnie leave the place. In fact, it was Guy who shot Duke when trying to shoot the police people.

He rides into the town of Rio Arriba, where four men, Alfonso Parral (Lee Van Cleef), Bill Zachary (Stephen Boyd), Ed Taylor (Albert Salmi) and Lujan (Henry Silva), fitting the description of the men he seeks, are in jail awaiting execution. The town has issued instructions to only allow the hangman Simms (Joe DeRita) to enter the jail, so Douglas is taken to Sheriff Eloy Sanchez's (Herbert Rudley) office to state his business. The town has never had an execution before, so they have brought in a man from another town for do the job. The sheriff allows Douglas into the jail to see the men. They claim they had never seen him before, but he isn't persuaded.In town Douglas sees Josefa Velarde (Joan Collins), who he had met five years previously while in New Orleans. When Douglas originally met her, Josefa had been husband hunting. Since then, she has been looking after her father's ranch after his death. Douglas reveals to her that he has a daughter (Maria Garcia Fletcher). Other inhabitants of the town include businessman Gus Steimmetz, his daughter Emma (Kathleen Gallant) and her fianc√© Tom (Barry Coe).Simms, the executioner, arrives the same day. He drinks with Douglas but is generally unfriendly. The sheriff invites Simms to see the men he is to hang, but Simms chooses to wait until the town's residents are at church for a pre-execution mass.While pretending to evaluate the men he is to hang, Simms stabs the sheriff in the back. The sheriff shoots and kills Simms in the struggle, but the inmates strangle the sheriff until he is unconscious.The four take his keys and escape, taking Emma as a hostage. The wounded sheriff interrupts the church service and tells the townspeople that the prisoners have escaped. The townspeople form a posse to ride out immediately and enlist Douglas to help them track down the outlaws, but Douglas is in no hurry and waits until morning. The posse pauses at a mountain pass and then they decide to leave Parral behind to prevent anyone from following them through the pass. Douglas catches up with the posse the next day at the pass, where they are held up trying to dislodge the outlaw.Douglas corners the outlaw Parral and shows him a picture of his wife in the cover of his pocket watch. Parral says he's never seen her before. Douglas accuses him of being one of the four who killed his wife. Parral denies it, pleading for his life, but Douglas kills him. Douglas follows the outlaws and next tracks down Taylor. He lassos Taylor by the feet and hangs him upside-down from a tree, leaving him to die. The two remaining men reach the house of John Butler (Gene Evans), a prospector and Douglas's neighbor. Zachary kills Butler and Lujan steals the sack of coins that Butler tried to run off with. Zachary attacks Emma, but Lujan sees someone approaching in the distance and tells Zachary they must leave, and after Zachary rapes Emma they leave. Josefa and Douglas arrive at Butler's cabin from different directions where Douglas identifies Butler's body. The posse arrives and finds an injured Emma in Butler's cabin. Douglas tells the posse to ride on while he goes back to his ranch to get fresh horses.When Douglas arrives at his home he finds that the fugitives have taken his last horses. Leaving Josefa with his daughter, he rejoins the posse. When they arrive at the Mexican border, the other members of the posse refuse to cross the border and Douglas goes on alone. He finds Zachary in a bar and shows him the photo of his wife. Zachary says he has never seen the woman before and asks what Douglas wants. Douglas insists that Zachary is one of the four who killed his wife, and Zachary pulls his weapon in self-defense, but Douglas kills him first.Douglas see Lujan run away. Lujan greets his wife and learns that his son is ill. Douglas tracks Lujan to his home and arrives to find him fetching water.

Douglas shows Lujan the photo of his wife. Like the other three, Lujan says he has never seen the woman before. Douglas asks why Lujan is riding one of Douglas' horses, and Lujan says that he and his companions rode past the Douglas ranch on their way from the border. Pointing to the sack, Douglas states that the men who killed his wife stole the sack containing the family's life savings. When Lujan tells Douglas that he took the bag from Butler's dead hand, Douglas realizes that Butler killed his wife.Douglas realizes that he has been pursuing men who had nothing to do with his wife's death. He remembers that he showed each of them a picture of his wife, and all of them denied ever having seen her. Douglas sees that he is no better than the men he has been pursuing, having murdered them in cold blood. He returns to the town where the hanging was to take place and goes to the church to beg forgiveness from the pastor. The priest (Andrew Duggan) says that Douglas did what he felt was right and to his credit, does not take refuge in the fact that they were outlaws anyway. Josefa then arrives with Douglas' daughter, and as they exit the church together, the sheriff and the townspeople celebrate Douglas' success at tracking down and killing the men."
tt0051444,"['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'War']","A Japanese prisoner of war camp in the jungle on an island in the Malay peninsula at the end of the second world war in 1945. One prisoner is being forced to dig a grave by Japanese soldiers. When he has finished they make him stand by it and shoot him so that he falls back into the grave he has just dug.Colonel Lambert [Andr√© Morell] argues in disgust with the Japanese Captain Sakamura [Marne Maitland] at the way the prisoner has been murdered for attempting to escape. He is permitted to see camp Commander Yamamitsu [Ronald Radd] where, through an interpreter [Wolfe Morris], he complains about the treatment of the prisoners and the conditions. Yamamitsu is angered by Lambert's remarks and warns him about prisoner behaviour and that he will make reprisals against women and children held in another nearby camp if the prisoners do not behave. Lambert leaves to confer with the other officers. It is apparent that the prisoners have destroyed a Japanese radio and that one escapee Keiller is still currently free. Cyril Beattie [Walter Fitzgerald] also thinks Lambert should obey the Japanese as they are making things worse for themselves and those in the women and children's camp by trying to escape.The camp's chaplain Paul [Michael Goodliffe] is taken by the Japanese to the women's camp to give a burial service. Amongst the prisoners in the women's camp are Keiller's wife Kate [Barbara Shelley] and Beattie's wife Helen [Mary Merrall]. Helen and Father Paul are the only two who understand Latin so he uses this in his burial services to pass messages between the camps.At the male camp, Lambert inspects the prisoners and encourages one of them to return to the forced labour work the Japanese make the prisoners undertake. The Japanese bring Father Paul back along with a number of mail sacks and a number of boxes. The prisoners want their long overdue mail but Lambert is more interested in what might be in the boxes. Meanwhile, in one of the sick bays, Dutchman Van Elst [Carl M√∂hner] attempts to tune a home-made radio but hears only static. He narrowly avoids being seen by the guards after he hides the radio and returns to the living quarters. Lambert tells the other officers that Yamamitsu will kill everyone in both camps if Japan loses the war because his previous war crimes mean he will be executed so he has nothing to lose. From what the Allied officers have previously heard on their radio they know the war is now over and Japan has surrendered but they have to keep the news secret from Yamamitsu to avoid a slaughter.The Japanese get a radio working one night so Van Elst sneaks into the radio room and shorts the circuit out behind the back of the guard. He escapes back to the living quarters while the guard is being reprimanded. The next day the Japanese accuse the prisoners of sabotaging the radio so they take six prisoners as hostages for future punishment and force one of them to burn all of the mail sacks. Just then an American fighter flies over but the pilot Peter Bellamy [Phil Brown] has to bail out before the plane crashes nearby. He is surprised when the Japanese capture him, complaining that the war is over, but the Japanese do not speak English. In their truck they have the recaptured Keiller [Richard Wordsworth]. He tells Bellamy not to tell the Japanese the war is over. Keiller knows he will be executed when they get back to the camp, so as they pass the women's camp he jumps off the truck and runs to see his wife one last time through the barbed wire fence before being shot dead by the guards.Bellamy is taken to the camp but refuses to give Sakamura and Yamamitsu any information other than his name and rank so they beat him. The Japanese make the prisoners form a parade in order to show them that Keiller has been shot and hostages will be executed if there are any further escape attempts. Beattie again pleads with Lambert to negotiate with Yamamitsu but they fear he will kill all prisoners if he finds out the war is over. Beattie goes to ask to see the Commander, to the concern of the other officers, but Captain Sakamura refuses and knocks him over and Beattie loses heart.Lambert plans an escape with the others to try and get a message to the Allies via a transmitter on the mainland. They argue over who should go but Lambert insists he should. He asks Father Paul to get a message to Kate Keiller at a burial the next day, so that she can accompany him in the escape. However, when Father Paul gets to the women's camp he discovers that the deceased is Helen Beattie, the only woman who understands Latin, so he is unable to pass the message on.During the forced labour work the next day, Bellamy and Van Elst manage to escape into the jungle. They overpower a Japanese soldier and steal his jeep but have to hide for the rest of the day to avoid capture. As a punishment for the escapes, the Japanese execute the six hostage prisoners by beheading.That night Lambert plans an attack with the other officers on the Japanese guards. He has a box of old hand grenades which have been hidden for three years and instructs the men to make any weapons they can.Bellamy and Van Elst break into the women's camp and Bellamy rescues Kate to help guide them to the mainland, but during their escape Van Elst is shot by the guards. Bellamy and Kate drive to the coast and swim to the mainland although Kate is exhausted and Bellamy has to help her but they reach safety and freedom.The next day the Japanese bring Van Elst's body back and take another six prisoners for punishment, but Beattie again insists Sakamura takes him to Commander Yamamitsu. In Yamamitsu's office Beattie pulls the pin out of a grenade, killing Sakamura and Yamamitsu and sacrificing himself in the process. In the subsequent confusion, the other prisoners attack the guards with the other grenades and home-made weapons. An intense battle ensues between the prisoners and guards with many casualties on both sides. Then American aircraft fly overhead dropping parachutists and the battle is soon over and the prisoners freed."

tt0051459,"['Drama', 'contentRating', 'Not', 'Rated']","In the opening scene, Brick Pollitt (Paul Newman), a former high school football star, spends a drunken night jumping hurdles on a school athletic field at Eastern Mississippi High School in a tragic attempt to recapture his glory days. He falls and breaks his right ankle.Some days later, Brick and his older brother, Gooper (Jack Carson), visit the family cotton plantation in eastern Mississippi to celebrate their father's 65th birthday on a hot and humid August day. The family rumor is that the wealthy patriarch ""Big Daddy"" Pollitt (Burl Ives) may have developed colon cancer and would be forced to quickly settle his will, leaving his money and land to one of his two sons before he dies.Gooper and his shrew wife Mae (Madeleine Sherwood) have gone to great lengths to stay in Big Daddy's good favor. Gooper has lived his entire life in accordance with his father's casual instructions, and he and Mae have a ""dynasty"" of five children to carry on the Pollitt name. Brick's wife Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) is clever and outspoken, and holds no small amount of contempt for Gooper and Mae's entitled attitudes and five spoiled and obnoxious offspring (which Maggie frequently refers to as ""no-neck monsters"") who run around the house unsupervised. Brick, recovering from his leg injury on crutches, spends all his time in his bedroom, drinking heavily and argues with Maggie about the dismal state of their marriage. Maggie still adores Brick, though she is troubled by his self-destructive behavior, and Brick is angry and sullen towards Maggie because of a yet unspecified incident involving his recently-deceased friend. Adding to the pressure is Gooper's and Mae's constant criticism of Brick and Maggie due to Brick's alcoholism and the fact that they are childless.Big Daddy and his wife Ida (Judith Anderson) arrive home on their private airplane from the Mayo Clinic where Big Daddy received the news that he is not dying of cancer after all. They are greeted at the airport by Gooper, Mae, and their brood of kids, but Big Daddy ignores them and is driven home by Maggie. Big Daddy is openly dismissive of Gooper's and Mae's sycophantic attitudes, knowing that they fawn over him in an attempt to secure his money and plantation for themselves. Upon arrival back at the Pollitt plantation, Brick refuses to greet his father or come down for the party, and remains in his room, drinking.While the birthday celebration begins, Maggie runs upstairs to tell Brick of Big Daddy's positive test results and entreats him to make an appearance at the party. Brick refuses and continues drinking. Disappointed, Maggie declares that she cannot live without Brick, but when she embraces him, he flees, locking himself in the bathroom. Moments later, Ida bursts in to the bedroom looking for Brick and demands to know if he is still drinking. She then remarks that Maggie's continued childlessness and Brick's alcoholism are indicative of a failed marriage. Dr. Baugh (Larry Gates) then intervenes, asking to examine Brick's ankle. Once alone with Brick, Dr. Baugh confides that he has lied about Big Daddy's condition, which is fatal. The doctor admits he privately told Gooper the truth during the drive from the airport, but decided to spare Big Daddy and Ida to let them enjoy the party. In reality, Big Daddy has terminal colon cancer and will be dead within a few months. The brothers initially keep the information to themselves, but Brick soon tells Maggie, who is deeply saddened.As the evening wears on, the party wines down as it begins to rain, forcing the few guests and family inside. As the last of the guests depart, Big Daddy soon grows annoyed with the party and his fickle family and ventures upstairs to speak with Brick, his favorite son. He chastises him for his excessive drinking, and for his cold treatment of Maggie. Brick grows defensive and even violent when Big Daddy brings up the subject of Skipper, Brick's old football buddy who had jumped from a fifth-floor hotel window to his death a few years before. Realizing that there is more to the story, Big Daddy brings Maggie into the conversation. She explains that she hated Brick's pro-football career because he always put it before her, and that she hated Skipper for distracting Brick from his marriage. (Note: there is subtle suggestion here that Brick and Skipper had been romantically involved.) Maggie describes a drunken episode between herself and Skipper in which she considered seducing him simply to spite her husband, but reconsidered at the last minute. Brick then explains that Skipper had telephoned him, seeming to think that he and Maggie had actually made love (though he had been too drunk to remember clearly). Skipper tearfully tried to apologize to his best friend, but Brick angrily hung up on him. Skipper killed himself soon after, and Brick blamed Maggie for the tragedy. Brick angrily leaves the house as the thunderstorm rages. Big Daddy follows him out into the rain and tries to prevent his drunken son from getting into the car and driving home, but Brick angrily reveals to his father that the doctor had lied... that his illness is terminal. A shocked Big Daddy goes inside the house and down to the basement to be alone, while Brick, emotionally exhausted, is escorted back inside by Maggie.During this time, as nearly all of the other guests have left the party, Gooper and Mae had been trying to convince Ida to settle Big Daddy's will to give them the entire estate. Ida is still unaware of her husband's condition. As Ida begins to feel stress from all the hub-bub, Mae lets it slip that Big Daddy's cancer test was positive as Gooper told her minutes ago. The doctor has no choice but to admit the truth. Ida is at first overcome, but then firmly states that her husband will not be dying anytime soon, desperately trying to hold together the last traces of family unity. Maggie joins the conversation and speaks calmly to Ida to soothe her, whereas Gooper and Mae continue to hound Ida with demands. At this point, the personal rivalry between the two sisters-in-law, Mae and Maggie, becomes clear as they begin arguing with each other. Maggie reveals that she sees Mae as a dishonest, greedy, selfish, trailer-trash interloper who married Gooper solely for his parents wealth; Mae, who is pregnant with her sixth child, verbally counter-attacks with her belief that Maggie does not deserve any inheritance because she is childless and her husband drinks.Meanwhile, Brick has put on clean dry clothes and followed his father to the cellar. Big Daddy sits in silence in his bathrobe as the apologetic doctor explains that there is no use in hiding the truth. He gives Big Daddy morphine and a syringe for the pain, and returns upstairs. Brick and Big Daddy slowly begin to rehash the past, with Brick angrily pointing out that Big Daddy's version of ""family love"" consists of showering his wife and sons with money and material possessions. Big Daddy admits that he indeed does not care for many of his family members, including his wife, and that he built his business to demonstrate the great things he was capable of.After further prodding, Big Daddy recollects his own father: a Spanish-American War veteran and boxcar tramp with no real job and no authority. Though he first speaks of his father with hostility, Big Daddy begins to smile as he remembers the fun he had as a child in traveling with his drifter father. He admits that he had loved his father more than anything, though he had been poor and overlooked by society. Brick becomes overwrought with emotion and trashes the basement, breaking the expensive items that his father had bought over the years to demonstrate his wealth. Once he calms down, he finally sees eye to eye with his father and the two weakened men help each other up the stairs.Maggie, Gooper, Mae, and Ida are still in a heated conversation in the living room over Big Daddy's will, with Gooper and Mae demanding the majority of his estate when he passes on. Brick overhears his brother and sister-in-law mocking him for his drinking habit, and calmly intervenes. Big Daddy speaks to his wife with newfound respect and affection, and has adopted a positive outlook despite his condition. To halt the argument about the inheritance, Maggie tells the family that she is finally pregnant. Mae is outraged and calls her a liar, but Big Daddy and Ida are happy at the news. Brick goes upstairs and calls for Maggie. In their bedroom, Maggie thanks Brick for going along with her lie: she is not really pregnant, but wanted to give Brick's parents some hope for the future. Brick assures her that they ""are through with lies and liars in this house."" They lock the door and go to bed, rekindling their romance at last."

He takes a flight to Washington, DC, where he plans to return to the public relations firm he founded, Eaton & Baker. On the plane, he meets Dr. Jessup, a peace activist, who gives him the address of a private hotel run by his friends. Eaton shows up at the PR firm, only to discover that his partner, Baker, was killed the previous year in a car accident. Before that, he sold out to Jim McGinnis. Eaton is angry, and comes to blows with McGinnis, but his secretary, Lorraine, intervenes. He is shown the contract which appears to be legitimate, as it was witnessed by Barney Bond, a timid data analyst for the firm. McGinnis offers him a position with the firm as a consultant, and Eaton says he will think it over.He goes to visit Sen. Walder, an old client and friend. Walder's committee is investigating the influence of lobbyists on Congress. Over lunch, he asks Eaton to help him out by taking the position at the PR firm, and feeding him information. A newspaper reporter, Hillyer, stops at their table. He isn't sure that Baker's death was accidental.Eaton returns to the firm and accepts the offer. Barney shows him to his new office, and Eaton queries him about their current clients, especially the political work they are now doing. Eaton argues that their job is to measure public opinion, not mold it. After Barney leaves, he speaks with Lorraine, whom he suspects has negative feelings about McGinnis. As he is getting ready to go that evening, he has another conversation with Lorraine, but he has a fainting spell. She offers to drive him to the hotel where he has left his baggage. He has been unable to find a hotel, but he remembers the address given to him by Jessup, so he goes there.The couple who run the boarding house (Vivian and Harold Loder) take him in. Harold claims to be a war veteran himself. Vivian is obviously flirtatious. Harold shows Eaton to his room.Eaton awakens from a nightmare recollection of his imprisonment, and overhears the couple fighting.The next morning VIvian serves him breakfast.

He takes his things and leaves.At the office, he queries Barney about what appear to be loaded questions asked in the gubernatorial race they are working on. He asks to see the card files, so he can determine if the survey was conducted with a representative sample. Barney explains that those files are under lock and key in McGinnis's office. After Barney and McGinnis leave, he asks Lorraine what she knows. He takes a chance and asks her to help him get the key. She agrees.In the foyer, McGinnis calls Lorraine in for some dictation. Before she can get to his office, Barney tries to hit on her, but she refuses. In his office, McGinnis takes out his keys to open a drawer, and goes into another room to shave.

tt0051622,"['Drama', 'Horror', 'SciFi']","The 1958 version of The Fly, written by James Clavell, based on a short story by George Langelaan, opens with title and credits shown over a screen with a small hole. We zoom in progressively until the hole fills the screen and a fly crawls into frame.The opening scene is at night, outside the factory of Delambre Freres Electronics in Montreal. A cat, Satan, is picked up by the night watchman, Gaston (an uncredited Torben Meyer). He starts his rounds. He hears the sound of a hydraulic press starting. Gaston sees a smartly dressed woman, who he later recognizes as Helene Delambre (Patricia Owens), stare at him in surprise. She runs away. He approaches the press and notices, in horror, that it is covered in blood. A body lays crumpled on the floor next to the press. He recoils in horror and screams. A phone rings in the home office of Francois Delambre (Vincent Price). His sister-in-law, Helene, is calling. She calmly tells him, ""Francois, I've killed Andre. I need your help."" Francois thinks it is a cruel joke but changes his mind when Helene breaks down sobbing and implores him to, ""Call the police and come quickly."" Before he can leave his office, there is another call, this time from Gaston at the factory. Gaston reports a murder. Francois calls an acquaintance at the Anthenium Club, a fellow member, Inspector Charas (Herbert Marshall). He reports the crime, then waits for Charas to collect him at his home. As Charas and the police examine the crime scene, an ambulance team collects Andre's body. Francois raises the press so what is left of the body can be removed. It is noted that the press was set to zero and single strokes. Francois positively identifies his brother based on a scar on his left leg--war wound. Francois is baffled by the crime.Francois and Charas go to see Helene at home. Emma (Kathleen Freeman), the housekeeper, meets them at the door. Dr. Ejoute (an uncredited Eugene Borden), the family doctor, reports that she is calm and admitted to the crime. They enter the living room to confront Helene Delambre. She is very calm and volunteers, ""I killed my husband, Andre Delambre, about half an hour ago in the hydraulic press shed."" She admits to killing him, but when asked why she is adamant, ""I cannot answer that question."" She provides specific details of the crime, then offers Charas coffee. She is polite and answers all questions except one--WHY. She hears the buzz of a fly in the room. She gets up and searches for it. She registers relief when she finds it on a lampshade and it is only an ordinary fly. She returns to the couch and more questions from Charas. Charas makes arrangements with the doctor to provide a police nurse to attend to Helene. Before he leaves, Charas asks Francois to show him the lab. Francois discovers the lab a shambles. Charas tells Francois that he is baffled and, ""There appears to be no motive, no reason except insanity."" Charas suggests Francois take charge of his nephew for the time being.The police nurse, Andersone (Betty Lou Gerson) brings Helene her lunch, then takes her pulse. She sits and occupies her time with her reports and needlepoint. Helene makes a point to mention her son, but pretends she does not know him. The nurse registers mild surprise, then makes a note on the chart. Helen starts eating, then stops when she hears a fly buzzing in the room. The nurse bats at it, much to Helene's shock and concern. The nurse rolls up a newspaper and chases it around the room. She becomes hysterical when the nurse swats it by the window. Helene collapses and is helped back to bed sobbing. The nurse collects the dead insect and gives it to Charas. Charas asks Francois, ""Mr. Delambre, do you think shes mad?"" ""It's obvious, isn't it?"" is the reply, but Charas surprises Francois with his conclusion. ""In spite of what the doctors think. I believe Mrs. Delambre's mind is quite clear. Even when catching flies."" Charas intends to charge Helene with murder, the warrant will be issued the next day.Francois is having dinner with his nephew, Philippe (Charles Herbert). When asked about the life expectancy of flies, Francois responds that he doesn't know. Philippe volunteers that he found the special fly his mother was looking for--one with a white head and leg. The discussion intrigues Francois, especially the mention of it being in his study. He calls Charas, but decides not to talk to him. He goes to his brother's house, and lies to the nurse to secure a visit with Helene. He convinces Helene he has the special fly and wants the whole story. He finally convinces her to come clean, but before she recounts the tale she insists Charas be present. She demands Francois promise to kill the fly he claims he has. Charas arrives and she tells her story.It started a few months earlier. She and her son are playing in the living room when her husband, Andre (David Hedison as Al Hedison) appears. While Philippe plays with the family cat, Dandelo, Andre and Helene go to the basement lab. Andre proudly shows her all the new equipment. He demands secrecy, then shows her his new line of research. He places an ugly green plate, a wedding present, in a glass and metal container. He fires up the machine. The room goes dark, and the container glows a bright blue, then a flash of light and the equipment powers down. Helene is surprised by an empty container. They walk to another room and the plate is now in an identical container. Andre explains the concept to his disbelieving wife. She chuckles, noticing that the matter transference device has one little flaw. Helene points out the ""Made in Japan"" stamp on the bottom of the plate is mirror-imaged. Andre returns to his desk and begins a review of his work. He recalculates, rechecks and retests. This time with a newspaper, the transfer is successful. Andre decides to run a test with the family cat, Dandelo. The saucer of milk transfers fine, but to his horror the cat fails to appear. He hears only the plaintive echo of the cat's cries in the room.Helene is preparing to go out for the evening. Andre appears. He has been busy in the lab for weeks and insists they go out to celebrate. They return to the lab very late and Andre shows his wife the improvements he has made to the equipment by transferring a bottle of champagne. The label is perfect and the wine is still cold. He then transfers a guinea pig, against his wife's objections. The animal appears fine after re-integration. Andre confesses that his first live animal experiment, Dandelo, was not successful. Helene expresses her concern about the technology, ""It's frightening. It's like playing God.""It has been a month and the guinea pig is fine. Andre is relaxing out in the garden. Helene joins him. She tells Andre that Francois is coming to lunch. Andre is excited and tells his wife, ""Bring him down to the lab. We'll show him now."" Francois and Helene go down stairs to the lab, but encounter a note on the locked door instead of a welcome inside. It says, ""I am working. Do not Disturb."" Francois comments about the bad penmanship. Philippe enters the house. He excitedly tells his mom, ""I caught such a funny-looking fly. You want to see it? It has a funny white head and sort of white leg."" His mother tells him to let it go at once.A report from Emma about Andre not touching his dinner does not alarm Helene. She walks down to the lab to check on her husband. She picks up a note that was slowly pushed under the locked door. She reads it aloud, ""Helene, I've had some trouble. I've had a serious accident. But I'm not in danger at the moment, although it's a matter of life or death. It's no good calling to me or saying anything. I can't answer. I can't speak."" He asks for a bowl of milk laced with rum. She prepares the concoction and returns to the lab, knocking three times to gain entry. Andre lets her in. A note explains that he needs her to find a fly with a white head. She remembers Philippe's find from earlier that day. Andre has a black cloth covering his head and keeps his left arm hidden in his lab coat pocket. He slurps up his milk while Helene searches for a fly she knows is not there. She recounts the story her son told her. Andre gets up and his fly arm is revealed. Helene screams. Andre motions her out of the lab, then locks her out. He types the next set of instructions for his wife.The next morning Helene wakes. She thinks the whole episode was just a nightmare, but her morning meeting and typed note confirms the nightmare is real. Andre explains that his experiment by transmitting himself the first time was successful. A second try was not so. The note explains, ""But in the second experiment, a fly which I did not notice was in the disintegrator with me. When we integrated again, our atoms were mixed. Now my only hope is to find the fly. I've got to go through the machine once more and pray our atoms untangle. If you can't find it, I'll have to destroy myself."" Helene asks to see her husband's face, but he refuses. Helene tells Emma that they must find a fly. She presses her son into service to find the special fly. Helene screeches at Emma, who misunderstood the request and killed a fly with a swatter, ""I said catch them! Dont kill them!"" After Philippe returns with no luck, he and his mother spot the fly on a lamp shade. The head and one leg are indeed white. They carefully approach it, but it flies over to the window. Helene puts out some sugar to attract their prey. Philippe catches it, but it escapes the net. It escapes outside through a broken section of the glass. It is now outside and Helene and Philippe search for it. Helene is exhausted and exasperated. She returns to the lab and tells her husband of their bad luck. While he attempts to eat, she reads his next note, ""If you had caught the fly, you would not be reading this. I know you will never catch it now. It's hopeless. There are things man should never experiment with. Now I must destroy everything, all evidence, even myself. No one must ever know what I discovered. It's too dangerous. I've thought of a way. It's not easy, but I need your help."" She pleads with her husband not to destroy himself. She convinces him to transmit himself one more time, even without the fly. Transmission is successful, but without the fly, he is the same. She pulls the black cloth away, then shrieks with horror at the visage. Andre has the head of a fly. We see Helene as Andre now sees her through compound eyes. She backs away from Andre and faints. He picks her up and places her on the couch in the lab. He comforts her with his good arm and hand, but can't control his fly arm that means to harm his wife. He goes on a rampage and destroys the delicate electronic equipment. He burns all his notes. Helene wakes and approaches her husband. She recoils from Andre as he approaches her. He retrieves the black cloth and puts it back over his head. He erases the blackboard, then scribbles another note to Helene, ""No use now--help me--but don't come near me. Kill fly, please. Love you."" She follows him to the factory next door. He starts the press and points to the red button. He places his head and arm under the press then motions for her to start the press. The press crushes Andres fly head, but his arm is still untouched. She resets the press, places his fly arm on the bed, then directs the press down a second time. The story is finished, and we are back in the present.Charas is told Andre destroyed his notes, but she erased his note on the blackboard. Charas thanks her for telling the story. Francois and Charas prepare to leave the house. Charas promises, ""I'll be back at 10:00 with a warrant for her arrest on the charge of murder. Nurse Andersone is under strict instructions not to leave her for any reason. I'm satisfied now. She's quite insane. She won't hang."" Charas provides a glimmer of hope to Francois, ""Show me the fly.""The next day Francois returns to the house and asks Emma about the fly. She tells Francois it was just a fly. Francois sits on a bench in the garden, oblivious to the fly caught in a spider's web. It cries out for help, but Francois cannot hear it. It is now 10:00 a.m. and Charas has returned, as promised, with his warrant and an ambulance to transport Helene. When told of her arrest, Helene reacts by asking Francois to show the inspector the fly. Francois admits he never had the fly. Francois takes Philippe outside so he can't witness his mother's arrest. He mentions he saw the fly again, ""It's in a web. A spiders going to get it. By the bench in the garden."" Francois retrieves Charas. They walk out into the garden. Charas and Francois see the tiny arm and head on a fly's body and the spider ready to pounce. The tiny thing screams, ""Help Me!"" As the spider covers its tiny victim, Charas picks up a rock and crushes both. Francois accuses Charas that if Helene killed a man with a fly's head, then he is as guilty for killing a fly with a man's head. They collectively concoct and agree to a scenario for suicide.Sometime later, Philippe and Helene are playing croquet in the yard. Francois arrives to take his nephew to the zoo. In reply to his nephew's query about his father's death, Francois tells Philippe, ""He was searching for the truth. But for one instant, he was careless. The search for the truth is the most important work in the whole world and the most dangerous."" We close with Helene escorting her son and Francois out of the yard."

The Becks purchase a large house and Bill who is a physicist, sets up his laboratory on the top floor. Soon they will celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary. While carrying Bill's lunch up the three flights of stairs, Julie is suddenly out of breath and dizzy. She falls down a flight of stairs and the noise alerts Bill. He assumes she slipped and fell. While consulting her doctor, who is also her former employer, Julie learns she has severe heart damage from a childhood bout of rheumatic fever. Dr. Miller recommends six weeks of bed rest and then taking it easy. He cannot predict how long she will live. Julie doesn't want to tell Bill the truth, so Dr. Miller decides to put a cast on her leg, giving her the perfect reason to stay in bed.The Becks do not have children and while she is recuperating, Julie starts thinking about adoption. Not an infant, but an older child who could be a companion for Bill in case she were to die. She expects that Bill won't go for the idea,especially since he doesn't know the real reason, but to her surprise he agrees. He tells her to look for a boy who can play baseball.HItty, a little girl starved for love, is on her way back to the orphanage. This is the third time she has been rejected by potentially adoptive parents after spending a month in their home. Mrs. McMasters, the director, assures Hitty that it is not her fault. The problem seems to be Hitty's overactive imagination. She doesn't seem upset, but after returning to her old room, she crawls into a cupboard and cries.Julie runs into Hitty when she visits the orphanage. While she is not thinking about adopting a girl, something about Hitty appeals to her. A child psychiatrist has been called in to examine Hitty after she pretends to be a horse for two days straight. She runs away from him and Julie catches up with her, eventually persuading her to be herself again and let the doctor help.The Becks invite Hitty to visit for an afternoon and Mrs. McMasters brings her. The child is very anxious to be back at the orphanage by dinner time,as her favorite foods are being served. She assumes the Becks will reject her just like everyone else, but Julie finds her delightful. She talks to Hitty about how, if she comes to live with them permanently, she will need to help take care of Bill. He is very absent-minded and often pays no attention to what is going on around him. Julie shows Hitty the ""Bill pull"" at the bottom of the stairs. It rings in Bill's laboratory as a signal that he is wanted downstairs, but often he does not hear it. Hitty asks what she should call them and Julie tells her to use their first names.When the adoption is finalized, the Becks' friends throw them a party to celebrate. After seeing the gifts they have brought for Hitty, Bill drives into town and buys her a toy horse and a child-size microscope. Hitty barely looks at the microscope but she is enchanted by the horse, which she names Ralph.Several months pass and Hitty isn't settling in as well as Julie expected. The child seems to get on Bill's nerves. While they are out in a boat, she accidentally drops Ralph overboard. Bill is irritated by her hysteria and assures her the horse will float. Later, Hitty tries to be helpful by cleaning all the blackboards in Bill's lab. Unfortunately she erases several months of work. Bill realizes she didn't do it on purpose but is still angry at having to start all over.Hitty comes down with flu on the night Julie and Bill are going to a dinner and lecture. While Dr. Miller assures Julie that Hitty will be fine, she doesn't feel right about going out and leaving Hitty with Sarah, the maid. She insists that Bill go without her and he does, obviously angry. After he is gone, Julie confides in Dr. Miller that the two simply aren't getting along. The doctor recommends returning Hitty to the orphanage. A horrified Julie at first rejects the idea, but seems to consider it after Dr. Miller reminds her that she can still visit the child.Several days later, Hitty is over the flu and begs Julie to take her swimming. Julie is re-shelving books, but puts them aside to have a talk with Hitty. Taking the child's hands, she begins to talk about people being selfish and wanting too much. Suddenly she becomes weak and dizzy. Hitty runs for Bill and Sarah, and Dr. Miller is called. Bill carries Julie to their bedroom and tucks her in. She confesses that she has a heart condition that she should have told him about, but that everything will be all right. He begs her to stop talking and rest.The next scene shows a disheveled Bill standing over a grave.

Eventually she decides that Bill doesn't want her and asks to be returned to the orphanage. Bill can't help but feel guilty, and on an impulse telephones Mrs. McMasters to check on the child. Unknown to either of them, Hitty had slipped out of bed and asked her toy horse to take her to Julie. She runs to the spot on the beach where they first met. But a storm is brewing.

Over the opening credits, five people arrive at the house being driving in ""funeral cars"". They are: test pilot Lance Schroeder (Richard Long), magazine columnist Ruth Bridges (Julie Mitchum), psychiatrist Dr. David Trent (Alan Marshal), the house owner Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook Jr.), and secretary/typist Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig). Except for the owner and for Dr. Trent (who wants to investigate the supernatural), they were all chosen because they wanted/needed the $10,000 that Loren was offering to anyone who could stay one night in the house. Add these five to Frederick and Annabelle Loren, and there are seven people in all -- three women and four men. Of course, some of them had underlying motives, too.During the gathering in the parlor, Watson Pritchard claims that seven people, three women and four men, including Watson Pritchard's brother, have been murdered in the house. Parts of the bodies were found all over the house, but the heads have never been found. Pritchard himself spent a night in the house and was found almost dead the next morning. He claims that the heads can be heard at night whispering to each other.Fredrick Loren enters who introduces himself and claims that he invited them to spend one night the house, with the stipulation that the power will be out and all doors will be locked at midnight, allowing no accessible escape. Anyone who stays in the house for the entire night, given that they are still alive, will each receive $10,000.He explains the rules of the party and gives each of the guests a .45 caliber pistol for protection. Loren's wife tries to warn the guests that her husband is psychotic, causing them to be very suspicious of him, especially Nora Manning, who becomes convinced that he's trying to kill her when she keeps seeing mysterious ghouls, including the ghost of Annabelle, who had hanged herself after being forced to attend the party.After being driven into a fit of hysteria by the ghosts haunting her, Nora shoots Mr. Loren, assuming he is going to kill her. Dr. Trent, another guest, tries to get rid of the body by pushing it into acid, but the lights go out, and when they come back on, both of the men are gone.Annabelle emerges, having faked her death with the help of Dr. Trent, and having apparently tricked Nora into killing Loren. Suddenly, a skeleton emerges from the acid accompanied by the voice of Loren. The specter approaches Annabelle as she recoils in terror. In this panic, the screaming Annabelle accidentally backs into the acid herself. The real Mr. Loren walks out of the shadow, holding the contraption that he was using to control the skeleton of Dr. Trent. In his triumph, he watches Annabelle disintegrate.""Good night, Doctor. Good night, Annabelle,"" Frederick Loren says to himself. ""The crime you planned was indeed perfect, only the victim is alive and the murderers are not. It's a pity you didn't know when you started your game of murder that I was playing, too."" Loren turns himself over to the other guests, informing them that Nora's gun was loaded with blanks and that Trent and Annabelle were conspiring to kill him.In the final scene, Prichard looks into the acid vat and says, with a terrified expression on his face, ""Now there are nine. There will be more...many more. They're coming for me now. And then they'll come for you."""

This is the story of one confronted by such strange forces within himself."" Robert Kraft (Richard Boone) and the caretaker, Andy McKee (Theodore Bikel) walk to the Immortal Hills Cemetary office building. Bob Kraft has taken over the chairmanship of the cemetery and is briefed on the routine by Andy. Bob notices a map on the wall of the cemetery. Andy explains that a black pin on a plot indicates someone buried and a white pin indicates a sold plot not yet occupied. Bob asks Andy, ""McKee you've been on the job now forty years, right?"" Andy replies, ""Aye,"" in his Scottish accent. Bob informs him he is to be retired and assures him he will draw the same monthly paycheck. Bob asks Andy for a replacement recommendation. Andy walks over to the desk and pulls a gun. He tells Bob it is available in case of emergencies. A young couple drive up to the office. It is Stuart Drexel (and uncredited Glen Vernon) and his new bride Elizabeth (an uncredited Lynette Bernay). A provision in Stu's inheritance is that he buy a plot for him and his wife before he can draw part of his trust from the bank. Beth is not amused by the entire situation and lets her new husband know. They drive off and Bob goes back to the office. Upon his return, Andy greets him with a shot of liquor. He explains that the previous chairman left it to sooth customers needing fortification to get through the burial process of a loved one. Bob places two pins on plots in the Drexel area of the cemetery.In his Department Store office, Bob, his Uncle George Kraft (Howard Smith) and the outgoing chairman, Henry Trowbridge (an uncredited Russ Bender) go through the formal process of swearing in Bob Kraft as the new chairman. Bob is not happy with the ""honor"", claiming he is far too busy to take on the role. But Uncle George insists, explaining that it is a family and company tradition and that it is his turn. While it is done pro bono, it is expected because three previous generations of Krafts did. It only entails a few hours a month of work. The caretaker takes care of day to day operations. As soon as he is sworn in he gets a telephone call from the local undertaker. He is told that Stu Drexel and his new bride, Beth, are dead.At the cemetery office, Bob and Andy are going over some paper work when the local newspaper reporter, Jess Jessup (Herbert Anderson) walks in. He tells Bob and Andy he is on the obituary detail, and complains the office is cold. When Bob tells Andy to change the Drexel pins from white to black, Andy informs Bob that they are already black. Bob dismisses it saying, ""I must have picked up the wrong color,"" when he marked the plots. Bob mentions the mistake made him feel eerie. Andy adds, ""I think he means he marked the young couple for death, sir."" Jess jokes that if any more pins are used to stay away from his area of the cemetery. As Jeff leaves, Bob's fianc√©e, Ann Craig (Peggy Maurer) arrives. She lightly complains that she was stood up for their lunch date. Bob and Ann quickly make up. Bob goes back to the map and randomly places a black pin on a plot. He looks to see his choice. A black and white pin sits on the ""W. Isham"" plot. He pulls the white pin out. The phone rings and he informs the caller that the funeral is for immediate family only. Ann returns to the office and they embrace and kiss.

No is the reply, but Andy does show some progress in another area. He has fixed the space heater. Bob reviews the paperwork and notices an invoice for the funeral of William Isham. The pair walk over to the map and Andy tells Bob that he was going to change the white pin to black, but noticed it was already black. Bob tells Andy he changed the pin. Bob calls Jessup at the newspaper office. He informs Andy he change the pin color before the man died. Jessup reassures Bob that there is nothing supernatural. It was just a coincidence.Uncle George and Bob are going over store figures when Bob blurts out that he is quitting the chairmanship. ""I'm going to call Bates, Honegger and Trowbridge right now and tell them I'm quitting."" He reminds his uncle that three incorrectly placed pins accounted for three deaths. Uncle George laughs out loud. He tells Bob he is going out to the cemetery to put some black pins on the map to wipe out the competition. The two drive out together. At the cemetery, George pulls out Henry Trowbridge's pin. Bob insists he actually make the exchange then places a black pin on the map. Bob has a shot of booze and the two depart.Later that evening, Bob calls Henry Trowbridge at home. His wife answers the phone. It is 11:40 p.m. and Henry's wife informs Bob that her husband is not breathing. The body count is now four. The police drive up to the cemetery office. Lt. Clayborne (Robert Osterich) talks to Bob. Incredulous, Clayborne summarizes the situation, ""Let me get this straight, Mr. Kraft. You say that every time you stick a black pin in the map, people turn up dead?"" Clayborne reminds Bob that the Drexel couple were killed in a traffic collision. Isham died of a cerebral hemorrhage and Henry Trowbridge had a coronary thrombosis. He investigated and found nothing to suggest foul play. Bob starts to think it isn't the map, but he may be responsible.At his store office, Bob is informed by his Uncle George that he needs a vacation and George arranges one. Bob asks the committee be assembled that night at 7:00 p.m. Ann tries to reassure Bob it is a coincidence and suggests the vacation be turned into a honeymoon. That evening the committee members meet in Bob's office. Bill Honegger (an uncredited Ken Drake) and Charlie Bates (an uncredited Matt Moore) join Uncle George and Bob Kraft. Bill has a proposal to keep Bob as chairman. The committee demands Bob go out to the cemetery that evening and change Bill, Charlie, and Uncle George's white pins to black, then go home to bed. The motion is passed, and Bob makes the changes as ordered. Andy McKee stops by the cemetery office and tells Bob to lock the office and never come back. The phone rings. It is Jess, and Bob informs him of the three exchanged pins. He tells Jess if anything happens to any of them it is his fault. His attempt to light the portable furnace is unsuccessful. He calls the police and asks for Lt. Clayborne. The Desk Sergeant gives him the number where he can reach him, but the number is always busy. He finally realizes the phone number he has been dialing is Bill Honegger's. Jess calls Bob and informs him that Clayborne is with him and that Honegger is dead. He adds that Charlie Bates was found in his apartment dead. Bob is worried about his Uncle George and is surprised when George walks into the cemetery office. George tells Bob that he has proved his point. George pulls his black pin out of the map then leaves the office. Bob calls the police and asks that a policeman be assigned to watch his uncle.Clayborne calls Bob to inform him that George can't be found. Bob exits the office and finds his uncle in his car, still on the cemetery grounds. He is dead. He drives back to the office. He informs Lt. Clayborne he found his uncle. He puts the black pin back on the map on his Uncle's plot.The next day Lt. Clayborne returns to the cemetery with Jess and Ann in tow. Clayborne asks about one Jacob Mittel. Bob tells the policeman that he is a buyer for the store and he is currently out of the country on business. At the insistence of Clayborne, Bob puts a black pin on his plot. He is informed that Mittel is not dead. He is in Paris. This is a test. The police are setting up a trap. Bob voices his objections. Clayborne suggests Bob may have some unknown power, like voodoo in the West Indies.Overworked and overtired, Bob begins to hallucinate. He blames himself for the deaths. He concludes that if he changes the black pins back to white he can return the dead to life. With the floor heater broken by his own hand, he gathers paper and kindling to light a fire on the floor to keep warm. Out in the cemetery, the graves of the recently departed are starting to unearth themselves. Bob discovers this after he awakens in the smoke filled office. He snags his overcoat on one of the headstones. Leaving it behind, he runs back to the office. He retrieves the gun from the overturned desk. Before he has a chance to commit suicide the phone rings. It is the voice of Mrs. Mittel. She tells Bob that a cable arrived informing her that her husband died in Paris, France. Andy walks in and tells Bob it must be impossible. Andy confesses to Bob that he was responsible for the deaths. Andy was upset at being dismissed after forty years of faithful service. Andy picks up the gun and explains exactly how he killed each one. Andy doesn't believe Jacob Mittel is dead. The police burst into the office after Andy drops dead. Clayborne explains that Jacob Mittel is actually alive. The call and cable were set up by the police with the assistance of Mrs. Mittel. They watched as Andy dug up all seven graves. Bob and Ann leave the cemetery office together. We close with a slow zoom in on the map. It falls off the wall."
tt0051756,"['Horror', 'SciFi']","The movie opens with title and credits shown with the Earth over a star field background. We zoom in on the Earth, and then fade to a pastoral scene of a park with a lake in the small town of Norrisville. A car drives up a two-lane road and pulls into the parking lot of the local bar and restaurant, King's. Two men exit the car and approach the entrance and we hear music coming from inside. They see a man and woman necking in a car. Five drunk men sit at a table. It is a bachelor party of sorts for Bill Farrell (Tom Tryon). He is getting married the next morning, so he leaves early. Sitting next to Bill on his right is his friend Sam Benson (Alan Dexter) and on list left is Mac Brody (Ty Hardin as Ty Hungerford). He reminds Bill that seeing his fianc√© before the wedding is bad luck. Harry Phillips (Robert Ivers) jokes that Bill is such a nice guy, It's a shame it has to happen to him. Bill gets in his car and drives off to see Marge. He drives along the lake and sees a body in the middle of the road and stops. He gets out of the car, sure he hit a person, but there is nothing there. He observes, ""I didn't think I had that much to drink."" A strange, glowing arm with three pointed fingers touches his shoulder. Bill turns around and recoils at the sight of a very strange humanoid alien (an uncredited Charles Gemora). Bill sinks down along the front fender of the car to the ground and is enveloped in a dark, billowing cloud. When the cloud disappears, so does Bill.It is morning and we are in the wedding chapel. Mrs. Bradley (an uncredited Mary Treen), the mother of the bride enters the room with flowers and humming the Wedding March, much to her daughter's annoyance. Marge (Gloria Talbott) is anxious as Bill has not arrived for the wedding. Bill walks in and apologizes for being late. After the ceremony the couple exits the Wee Kirk Wedding Chapel and gets in the car. The well-wishers throw rice. Marge throws the bouquet and Helen Rhodes (Jean Carson) catches it. She wants to marry Sam and intends to soon, if she can get him to the altar. As Bill and Marge drive past the lake the alien watches them. Bill almost hits another car on the road. He ""forgot"" to turn on his headlights. When Marge innocently asks about the mishap, he snaps at her. They arrive at their honeymoon hotel near the ocean. Bill forgets to open the door of the car for his new wife. She tells Bill, ""I know you've been absent-minded lately, but you can't have a honeymoon without a bride."" They share glasses of champagne. A storm brews outside as the couple prepare for bed. Marge is starting to think something is strange with her new husband. Marge goes inside and Bill stays outside to watch the storm. A flash of lightning reveals it isn't Bill, but a hybrid of Bill and the alien he encountered on the highway.One year later Marge composes a letter to her mother. She complains that she is both frightened and bewildered. ""Bill isn't the man I fell in love with. He's almost a stranger."" Marge decides not to send the letter. Sam and Ted Hanks (Chuck Wassal) are sitting in a bar and talk about not seeing Bill Farrell any more. Sam gets his coat and tells the bartender, Max Grady (Max 'Slapsie Maxie' Rosenbloom) that he is a home-wrecker. Sam starts to walk home, but he feels ill and wanders into an alley to puke. He hears a strange noise and turns to investigate. He falls backwards in shock and is enveloped in a roiling black cloud, and like Bill, when the cloud disappears, so does Sam.Marge looks at an X-Ray of herself and complains, ""That doesn't look like me at all."" She is meeting with Dr. Wayne (Ken Lynch). She saw the doctor to find out why she hasn't been able to get pregnant. The doctor admits he and his wife, Doris, took five years to have their first child. Before Marge gets out the door, Dr. Wayne asks, ""Why don't you have Bill come in and see me."" Marge stopped at a pet store and placed the cage in her car. A car honks its horn and pulls up behind Marge. Helen Rhodes pulls up with Sam Benson. She announces she and Sam are to be married. Marge drives home and gets the cage out of the car. Bill is outside and calls to her, spoiling the surprise. She pulls the cover off the cage and the dog growls at Bill. The dog snaps at Bill when he puts his hand near the cage. Bill tells Marge that perhaps dogs don't like him, but she reminds him he's had dogs all his life. Bill tells Marge to put the puppy down in the basement. Later that evening Bill goes into the basement. The dog is just as aggressive. Bill reaches out to the dog and kills it. Marge runs to the basement to check on the noise. Bill tells Marge the puppy is dead. When Marge asks how, Bill lies and tells her, ""Well, he must have strangled himself. I think his collar was too tight."" Marge tells Bill she saw Dr. Wayne today. She tells him she wants children and Bill should see the doctor. The doorbell rings. Marge answers it. It is Sam and he wants to see Bill. They talk briefly, and Marge excuses herself and walks upstairs. Alone, Sam reveals himself to Bill. He asks Bill, ""Did you make many mistakes at first?"" Sam admits he likes the pleasures humans enjoy, despite the stupidity, bad design and short life span. Sam finally gets to the point, ""They've improved the methane reservoirs in these bodies. You're due to report to the ship tonight."" Sam reveals his alien/human hybrid face.A police car pulls up a street and stops. Officer Schultz (Jack Orrison) asks his partner, Officer Frank Swanson (Peter Baldwin) if everything is ok. They see a drunk in the alley and go to investigate. Swanson hits Schultz, and then he and the ""drunk"" carry him out of sight up against a wall. The cloud envelopes Officer Schultz. It is clear now that many of the men in town have been abducted. After checking on his wife, Bill leave the house. He is unaware that Marge has seen him leave. She grabs a coat and slips it on over her nightgown. She follows her husband. The sound of a screeching cat draws her attention. Bill wanders back to the ship with Marge closely behind. She follows the sounds of foot falls in dry brush and spots Bill. She sees a black vapor exit her husband and an alien materializes. The glowing alien walks into a spaceship. Bill remains standing and Marge walks over to him. He is unresponsive and when she touches him, he falls backward, his eyes staring into space. Marge runs. She wakes in the gutter in town. She is drawn to the noise in the bar. She tells Max Grady the Bartender she just saw a monster. Sitting and leering is Weldon (James Anderson) and he instantly takes an interest in Marge. He thinks she is drunk or having the DTs and comments to Max, ""Funny thing. She didn't look like a lush."" Francine (Valerie Allen), the town hooker walks over and talks to Weldon, but he expresses no interest. Marge stops two policemen (Swanson and Schultz) in their car and asks to see Chief Collins (John Eldredge). Collins offers her a cookie and pours her a cup of coffee in his office. He listens sympathetically and assures her she is sane. But he doesn't believe in the aliens invading the Earth. He convinces Marge to go home and pretend everything is fine. He asks Swanson to take Marge home. Collins walks over to the window. A flash of lightning reveals his true nature. At home, Marge walks slowly into the living room. Bill is there, in the dark, and turns the lamp on. They walk upstairs.It is Sam's wedding day and the rehearsal is underway. Bill is acting as Best Man, and Marge is the Matron of Honor. Marge asks to speak to Helen. Marge begs Helen not to marry Sam, not today, but sometime later. Marge is not specific, and Helen ignores her suggestion. Bill walks in to tell Helen she is needed outside. Weldon has Marge Farrell's address and walks over to her house. Inside, Marge is looking for a lighter. She asks Bill why he isn't drinking. Bill comments that Marge has changed over the last few weeks. She avoids his presence, and his touch. Bill looks out the window and see Weldon. Suspecting something, he mentally summons Officers Schultz and Swanson to the house. They confront Weldon and arrest him. Weldon admits he's been sniffing around Marge. He pulls out a gun and shoots Swanson point blank three times. Schultz cold cocks Weldon. He asks his partner if Weldon is any use to their cause. Frank shakes his head, no, so Schultz kills the man with his service revolver. The shot wakes Marge. She and Bill talk, he admits he's learning. Bill leaves the house. Francine is on the move at the bar. Bill, Sam and Harry sit and stare at their drinks while they talk. They discuss pretending to be human. Harry thinks they are disgusting, but Sam admits he like them. Sam reveals the ultimate goal of their visit to Earth, ""Look, Harry, our scientists are working on a way right now to mutate human female chromosomes so we can have children with them."" Max notices the three men haven't touched their liquor and confronts them. He hits Bill twice, but Bill is unfazed and responds by putting his hands in his pockets. Max is surprised and a little scared. Max stares at his bloodied knuckles. Francine decides to leave the bar. She adjusts her nylons, then saunters down the street. She sees a hooded figure staring into a toy shop display window. She tries to attract a potential customer by asking for the time. The hooded figure refuses to answer Francine. It finally turns to face her and she is shocked. She runs away screaming. The figure points a weapon at her, fires, and she disappears into a glowing mass.Several couples are enjoying a picnic in the park. Ted Hanks teases his wife, Caroline (an uncredited Darlene Fields) about her throwing arm. Helen and Sam are out on the lake in a row boat. Sam falls overboard, and Ted comments, ""Oh, he can swim like a fish."" Marge notes that he is not swimming. Ted dives in to rescue his friend, while the rest of the men stand and stare. Helen dives in after her new husband. On shore, Doctor Wayne gives Sam oxygen, but instead of reviving him, it seems to kill the man. Helen spends the night with the Farrells and Marge checks on her before walking downstairs. She goes back to see Capt. Collins. Collins warns Marge about her delusions. Marge tries to call Washington, D.C. on a pay phone, but can't get through. She walks over to the Western Union office and talks to Mr. Potter (an uncredited Tony Di Milo). She fills out a telegram form to the FBI, pays the fee and walks away. She sees, through the window, that Potter tears up the form. She tries to drive out of town but is stopped at a road block. Swanson claims the road was washed out.At home, Marge sits on the couch in the dark. When Bills asks her, ""How about some light?"" She tartly replies, ""You don't need any."" She finally confronts the Alien Bill and tells him, ""I know you're not Bill. You're some thing that crept into Bill's body. Something that can't even breathe the same air we do. Sam died because oxygen was forced into his lungs."" Bill tells Marge he comes from a planet in the Andromeda Constellation. Their sun became unstable so they built a fleet of space ships to get away and that all their females died. He reveals their plans to breed with human females.Marge reveals all to Dr. Wayne. He believes Marge and comes up with a solution for finding human men. He needs help. Ted walks over to announce his wife delivered twins. Dr. Wayne recruits the men waiting in the maternity ward. Marge returns home. Bill is waiting in the living room. The posse of men arrive on the road to the field where the spaceship is located. One man, Charles Mason (Steve London) brings his hunting dogs. They take the path and fan out to search. Bills calls Chief Collins on the phone to inquire about his wife. Bill easily knocks down the door to their bedroom. The posse approaches the ship. A strange detector, a series of pipes and cylinders, scans the area. As Bill shakes Marge, demanding to know who she spoke to, he senses the approaching danger to his ship. In fact, all the alien imposters know and respond to the danger. Bill tells Marge, ""So your friends are attacking our ship?"" The ship opens and a couple of aliens exit. Bill gets into the police car and returns to his ship. Dr. Wayne and Mason fire at the aliens, but bullets enter, and the wounds instantly seal up. The posse retreats, but Mason releases his dogs. One of the dogs pulls the aliens breathing tube off. It bleeds from the wound, and the creature falls to the ground. The other dog attacks an alien in a similar fashion and the alien is also killed. The men return and stare at the alien body that disintegrates into a pile of gel-like goo. A small explosion destroys their ray gun. The posse enters the ship. Suspended above the floor are the real humans. They are attached by wires to small machines on the floor. Collins, Bill, Sam, and the two police officers are along one wall. Five more men are on another wall, and they include Harry and Mac. Dr. Wayne concludes, ""Electrical impulses from the real human bodies must give the monsters form and shape, even memories."" Dr. Wayne disconnects Officer Schultz and his corresponding alien falls to the ground and turns into the gel-like goo in clothing. As Dr. Wayne disconnects more humans, more aliens are stopped. Alien Bill realizes the mission has failed. Alien Capt. Collins reports on a battery shaped device, ""Earth mission has failed. They're alerted and dangerous. Suggest continuing on to another galaxy. Total personnel lost."" With his human plug pulled, Alien Collins collapses in his office. He finishes his report, ""Destroy scout ship."" He then collapses and turns into the gel-like goo. As the posse removes more men, Marge approaches the Alien Bill. He tells Marge, ""Your people have won. That makes you happy, doesn't it?"" Bill's plug is pulled and his alien counterpart collapses and writhes in pain. His body turns into a Jello-like goo. The real Bill calls to Marge. He smiles and they embrace. The ship explodes, and Marge and Bill embrace. We close with a scene of the Earth in space and a fleet of flying saucers traveling away."
tt0051767,"['Comedy', 'War']","It's 1944, in France, during WWII. In the aftermath of a big battle, scattered American ground troops find themselves disorganized and surrounded on all sides by German forces. Cut off from their company, and without a radio, U. S. Army Brigadier-General Charles Lane (Kent Smith), MSgt. Murphy Savage (Glenn Ford) and Cpl. Chan Derby (Red Buttons) come upon a group of five leaderless soldiers. After their shock of seeing a general out in the field, they accept Lane's encouragement and orders to set about trying to find help and work their way out of their situation. The general decides that a nearby, mostly intact farmhouse, will serve at their headquarters. He orders the five men to fan out and find any other stragglers they can, sending any officers and non-coms to him at the farmhouse.While checking to make sure the farmhouse is safe, Cpl. Derby comes upon a beautiful young French woman, Simone (Taina Elg), inside taking a bath. Simone is none too happy to see him inside her home, but it's also odd that she'd be all alone, in an unlocked and war-damaged farmstead, taking a bath. General Lane comes into the main room of the farmhouse and asks Derby what's going on. He explains that there's a naked woman in the other room. They wait for her to come out and attempt to calm her down and explain what they are doing there.Lane realizes, upon examining his map, that they are in the middle of a two-mile gap in the American line. Although Simone, who speaks no English, blames the Allied bombings for the destruction of her farm and the nearby local village, she grudgingly allows the men to set up an impromptu command post. She is very happy when the men offer her some C-rations. Murph and Derby are surprised by Lane's determination to remain in the field, to organize and lead a new offensive to plug that two-mile gap. As a general, he really sees that they have no other option. Standing outside and scanning the nearby hills with binoculars, Lane spots a German observation post atop a ridge. As Murph takes a look, gunfire erupts and Lane shoves Murph to the ground, but Lane is struck down, hit by fire from a German machine-gun nest hidden in a nearby ditch. Derby comes rushing out to see what all the shooting was about. He sees General Lane, lying dead on the ground. He and Murph work together to attack and destroy the German machine gun nest. After taking Lane's body to the farmhouse cellar, Murph and Derby lament his death and wonder what to do next. About that time, Corporal Terry Sellers (Dean Jones), who had been roaming around lost and confused, was sent to the farmhouse by the men that General Lane had earlier ordered to fan out and see who they could find. Seeing Murph holding Lane's helmet, Sellers believes that Murph is a general. Murph initially attempts to explain the reality of the situation to Sellers, but seeing that Sellers was on the verge of completely losing his mind from stress, he decides to save that for later.Sellers collapses onto a chair, in desperate despair, until Murph rouses him, speaking as General Lane would. Recalling Lane's assessment that leadership was desperately needed to rally the disorganized troops, and wanting to honor his long time commander, Murph decides to continue impersonating Lane in order to carry out the general's plan. Derby can't belief that Murph is actually serious about impersonating the general. He asks Murph if he's worried that life after the war is gonna be too dull for him, such that he'd prefer to spend it in prison, or even be executed. But, after witnessing the rather miraculous emotional recovery on the part of Sellers, and after some rather smooth talking that Murph directs at Derby, Derby decides to go along with the Murph's ruse.Uncertain of Murph's intentions, Simone grows suspicious when Murph asks her to pin Lane's star on his collar. Her attraction to Murph appears to overcome any doubts she has and she agrees to go along. Murph orders Sellers to drive the general's Jeep out to the group of five American soldiers, plus maybe half a dozen more they'd come across, gathered not far away. Murph is startled by the appearance of Lt. Jeff Clayton (John Wilder), who is very surprised to see a general out there. After Murph confirms that Clayton had never laid eyes on him before, he is assured that his disguise is safe and he resumes giving orders to all the men. Lt. Clayton and the men are impressed when Murph declares that he and Sellers will take out a German observation post that was giving them fits, thus convincing Clayton that the courageous ""general"" was a West Point graduate. Murph has the men use telephone wire to attach and piece of damaged galvanized steel from a boiler tank to the front of the Jeep to act as a shield.Meanwhile, back at the farm, Derby is dismayed by the appearance of Pvt. Orville Hutchmeyer (Tige Andrews), his and Murph's former master sergeant in boot camp. Having been busted to private after Murph turned him in for cheating, Hutchmeyer longs for revenge, and demands to know where Murph is. Derby tells Hutchmeyer that Murph was dead. Murph appears to accept that explanation, and turns his attention to Simone.Murph drives and Sellers shoots his machine gun as they attack the enemy observation post and destroy it, to the cheers of the American soldiers below. As they are returning to the farmhouse, Derby flags them down to tell Murph of Hutchmeyer's presence, but Derby assures him that Hutchmeyer has been sent away from the HQ building by the anxious to please Lt. Clayton. Derby tells Murph that Simone has helped medics turn the barn into an aid station and that two American tanks were parked in some nearby woods. They'd stopped in search of directions to the nearest fuel source.Hutchmeyer doesn't stay away for long, and Derby and Murph hear him whistling as he approaches on his bicycle, with some silk stockings he'd found someplace to give to Simone. Murph hurries to lock himself in the bedroom/bathroom, only Simone is in there, naked again, preparing to get dressed. She shouts at him to get out and won't respond to his entreaties for her to be quiet. Meanwhile, Derby does his best to figure out a way to get rid of Hutchmeyer, deciding to tell him that there's a general in the other room, with Simone. By then, Murph had decided to go ahead and let Simone shout and scream, figuring maybe that would scare Hutchmeyer away, but he doesn't anticipate Simone escaping into the main room and trying to lock him inside. Hutchmeyer is prepared to go in and take on the general for attacking Simone, when Derby decides to try some reverse psychology, encouraging Hutchmeyer to go ahead, but announcing that he was taking off, because he didn't want to get in trouble for breaking up the general's fun. Hutchmeyer decides that's a good point, so he rushes outside and knocks Derby off the bike and takes off.After Hutchmeyer's departure, Murph does his best to apologize to the bewildered Simone. She only seems to understand when Derby also offers his own version of events with gestures and sign language. Then, she laughs.Murph takes Derby and Sellers with him to go find the tanks in the woods. He leads them to a small bridge near some severely damage farm buildings, where he suspects the Germans may attempt to cross a creek with their own tanks. Lt. Clayton appears with a captured German officer, who reveals that a Panzer brigade is fast approaching. Realizing there are only two creek crossings within range, that bridge and a natural low area about a mile or two upstream, Murph sends Lt. Clayton to defend the low area, while he positions his two tanks inside the shells of the damage farm buildings. He wants to place a sign on the bridge, worded in German, warning that the bridge is mined with explosives. One of the American soldiers says he knows enough German to do that. The plan is that the tank commanders will decide to just take their tanks down one side of the small creek and up the other, which would expose their undersides to his own tank fire.While waiting for the Panzers, Murph confesses to Derby his apprehension about putting so many men at risk, and perhaps ruining General Lane's reputation. The man who lettered the sign also suddenly says he hoped he got the words right. Clayton then arrives and reports that four Panzers have broken through further up the creek. He says his men stopped two of the tanks, but the others were approaching the farmhouse. Two Panzer tanks arrive at the bridge and, as Murph had hoped, they begin to cross the creek ditch. They enter the creek bed at different times, so only the first one is vulnerable to a killing shot. The other tank turns and takes off, chased by the two American tanks. They are able to shoot and disable it.Murph then takes Derby and Sellers to set up an ambush for the German tanks that were on the way. They put mud in several of their men's helmets and take positions to wait. Sellers is directed to start firing at the tanks, in order to force their commanders and drivers to close their hatches. He is then to shoot at any following infantry.After Sellers opens fire on the tanks and the hatches close, Murph and Derby rush foward and jump onto the tanks and begin slapping the helmets and mud over the view ports. When the drivers and commanders can't see where they are going, they must stop. When the hatches pop open, Murph and Derby toss in grenades, killing the occupants.Lt. Clayton and his men move forward to assist, firing upon Murph, Sellers and Derby, mistaking them for Germans. Hutchmeyer is there by then too. He speaks German, and when Murph hears and then sees Hutchmeyer, he runs and hides behind a downed tree.Derby tells Sellers to play dumb about the general's hiding, then they ""surrender."" Derby then pretends that the ""general"" had departed and moved on to another area. A barrage of incoming fire sends the men scurrying for cover and Murph is knocked out by a piece of flying shrapnel. Derby can't hide the fact that they had an injured man, so he manages to cover Murph's face with a battle dressing so Hutchmeyer wouldn't recognize him. It's Hutchmeyer who grabs Murph and fireman carries him all the way back to the farmhouse. That evening when Murph regains consciousness, he's in the cellar. Simone is with him and she rushes to go get Derby. Derby relates the news that the bombardment they experienced was from Allied reinforcements, who arrived shortly after the tank assault. Lane's death had been reported by radio, and his body had been removed from the cellar. All the men who'd been involved in the tank battle had been removed to other areas, so Murph was able to resume his own identity. Relieved and pleased that Lane would be credited for the gallant stand at the farmhouse, Murph agrees with Derby that they must rejoin their outfit. He hates to leave Simone, but promises to return for her. He is very displeased to hear a drunken Hutchmeyer upstairs in the farmhouse, serenading Simone. Murph grabs a flashlight and ladder and climbs up to a window. He shines the light under his chin and calls out to Hutchmeyer, pretending to be his own ghost. He then switches off the light, so that Hutchmeyer suddenly realizes it is Murph, and very much alive. He rushes downstairs, ready to find and beat on Murph, but Derby smashes a chicken hutch over Hutchmeyer's head and tosses him into the back of the Jeep. Murph, driving, roars off in the Jeep, but has to pause briefly when Sellers comes running up, demanding to go along. He doesn't care if Murph is a general or not, he just wants to serve with him, so Murph tells him to get in and they take off."

A voice belonging to Colonel Edward Carruthers (Marshall Thompson) explains the first ship crashed 6 months ago, and hes the only survivor of the original crew. Because of the strange circumstances of the deaths, he fears his superiors on Earth may have doubts about his story.Back on Earth the press is briefed about the situation with the first Mars mission. The existence of a rescue second ship is revealed and that they have found Carruthers. It is explained that the survivor will be brought back for a court martial.During return preparations an airlock is found left open, we see the shadowy form of a strange creature enter the ship. The crew closes the airlock, unaware of the strange passenger. After successfully lifting off, the pilot Van Heusen (Kim Spalding) challenges Carruthers about the fate of the 9 dead crew members.

She is not sure Van Heusen is right, despite the evidence of the skull. Carruthers feels he can trust Ann and begins to opens up about exactly what happened. Carruthers was driving the exploration jeep when they encounter a dust storm. Amid the confusion, the crew is picked off the jeep one by one. He and others could hear strange sounds and faint shadows moving through the dust.

Investigating one of the air vents Carruthers discovers Kienholz's body. Jack Purdue (Robert Bice) thinks Gino might also be in the same crawl space and goes to check. He finds Gino, near death. Before Purdue, can aid him, he in turn is attacked. Escaping, he orders the crew to seal the air vent.Heusen finds some grenades in storage and begin rigging the air vents. If the creature tries to break out it is thought the grenades should kill it. Once the vents are rigged, the crew withdraws to the rec area and begins assembling all the weapons they can find. Gino's brother Bob (Richard Benedict) expresses anger that no further attempt is to made to save Gino.During these discussions the crew begins to wonder if the creature may be intelligent. They are convinced its use of the air vents was not a random action.The creature triggers the explosives, and judging from the howling and enraged sounds the crew suspect it has been injured but not killed.Waiting for a while the crew investigate they find huge amounts of damage but understand they have now isolated the creature on that deck. Seeing an opportunity they corner the creature and open fire with guns. It is unaffected and the creature counter attacks driving the crew back to the rec room.Mary Royce remembers Gino making gas grenades in case dinosaurs where encountered on Mars. Mounting another attack the crew uses the grenades to retake the lower deck. Once more they are driven off by the creature. Mary Royce does an autopsy on Kienholz's body. She reports that every drop of moisture is gone. Even the bone marrow is powdery, and his glands are completely gone. This knowledge does not help Van Heusen who was injured in the last battle and has come down with a fever she cant controlStrange banging noises are heard coming from the deck controlled by the creature. Checking through a hatch door they discover the creature is exploring the ship, looking for weaknesses. As they consider their options, it is realized they can get around the creature by going outside the ship and re-entering a deck lower than the creature.Carruthers and Calder make the dangerous trip and re-enter the ship. Realizing they have the advantage they decide to rig a trap that will electrocute the creature. With the task completed they lure the beast into the trap, unfortunately the plan fails. Carrruthers escapes back through an airlock but Calder has broken his leg and is trapped in a corner with nothing more than a welders torch.The crew establishes contact with Calder, and he explains how he's been able to stop the creature. The gas bottle he is using only has a 3 hour supply. To add to their problems, Ann advises that without fresh blood supplies Van Huesen will dieFinelli and Purdue undertake the mission with Carruthers. Calder lets them know the creature is doing something in the reactor room down to the lower deck to get the blood. Calder lets them know the creature has entered the reactor room. They automatically close the only door and hope once again the creature is trapped.Huesen now delirious activates the controls that open the reactor shields in the hope of killing the creature. He considers the death of the four men a fair bargain to destroy the creature. The creature however senses something is wrong and breaks out of the reactor room before the shield is deployed. Finelli is caught off guard and killed. The other two men escape into the control room.The creature goes on a ramgage and begins randomly destroying things. Playing a hunch Carruthers tells Cadwell to crawl to the airlock. He then tells the others to get into spacesuits. The way to destroy the creature is to vent the atmosphere from the ship.The creature makes one last ditch effort to break into the area controlled by the crew. It finally succeeds just as Carruthers triggers the venting process. The crew brace themselves as the air threatens to drag them out in the venting process. The creature trapped by the same airflow fights to save itself till finally with the air gone, it dies"
tt0051790,"['Biography', 'History']","The opening scene is in the throne room of the King of Poland, which has a floor resembling a giant chess board. The costumes are rich and ornate, and Polonaises, the music of Poland, play in the background throughout. Prince Andrei Kurbsky (Mikhail Nazvanov), formerly a best friend to Ivan, enters to hand his sword to the King, who receives it, then returns it, symbolizing a new vassal to lord relationship. Some of Kurbsky's formerly Russian lands are thus passed to Polish control. The courtiers in attendance are all smiles and welcoming faces. Many good looking ladies are sizing up Kurbsky. The ladies use their eyes to show interest either in the man or in the words he says.The happy atmosphere is interrupted by a disheveled courier who arrives and breathlessly announces that Ivan has returned to Moscow as Tsar. At this news, the party is over, and all present quickly leave the throne room.Ivan (Nikolai Cherkasov), back in Moscow as Tsar, looks older and more tired, and there is even a glint of madness and fear in his eyes. Stung at having had one boyar, namely Kurbsky, defect and put Russian land in foreign hands, he wants a new system where the land is always part of Russia and the boyars are caretaker managers of their districts with no power to transfer the land to outsiders. Since this increases his power at the expense of the hereditary landowners, the boyars, they unite in opposition to his plans, and he is alone and friendless.When he laments that he has no one to trust, the only he could trust was his wife and companion, now dead, the chief of his landless supporters, Czar's Guard Aleksei Basmanov (Amvrosi Buchma) tells Ivan that he is a true friend who can be trusted. Ivan immediately scolds him, telling him he cannot be a friend, since he is a hired servant.Basmanov and the Oprichniki help Ivan consolidate his power over the boyars with terror, arranging for the elimination of some of them.Needing friendship, and wanting to have somebody around to trust, he brings to court his old friend Kolychev, who has become Philip the monk, and makes him metropolitan bishop of Moscow. Philip is not willing to help Ivan in any way, insisting that the Tsars role must be to guarantee that old traditional ways of doing things will be maintained. Ivan is so sad and obsessed to have company that he even begs Philip on his knees to remain his friend.Philip agrees, but his intent is to try to bend Ivan to the will of the Church, and exacts a promise that he will have the right to intercede for anyone condemned to death. Philip is frustrated by what he sees as Ivan's misuse of power, as he takes his cues from the boyars.Meantime, Ivan has become used to using executions to consolidate his political power, killing not only those who openly defy, plot or disobey, but even people that he guesses might resent one of his upcoming decisions, such as the person Philip replaces in Moscow.Ivan faces down Philip and lets loose his private force, the Oprichniks, on the boyars. Although as Tsar he must keep his word, he circumvents his promise to Philip by executing those condemned so quickly that they are dead before Philip has even the news that might lead to a plea for intercession. In this way he has three boyars executed. About this time his nickname the Terrible begins to be used.As a sort of explanation of Ivan's relentless will to crush the Boyars, we see a flashback to Ivan's childhood. His mother was poisoned by boyars, and her last words to him were ""Don't trust the boyars."" Although young Ivan (Erik Pyryev) is given to wear the trappings of authority in Muscovy, decisions are made by a couple of old boyars who mock him when he asks questions. A bit later he learns that even very young he can assert his authority if he persists and has the will.The boyars, close to desperation, plead their case to Philip and win him over. He vows to block Ivan's abuse of power. In the cathedral a mystery is in process, the songs and representation telling about the terrible torments of fire that await those who refuse to do the will of God. Philip confronts Ivan, and as the argument heats up, Ivan, angry, proclaims that he will be exactly what the boyars call him, the Terrible, and has Philip seized.Fyodor Basmanov (Mikhail Kuznetsov), the first of the Oprichnina, helps Ivan figure out that the Tsarina was poisoned, and both suspect Ivan's aunt Efrosinia (Serafima Birman) of poisoning the wine cup. Ivan orders Fyodor not to say anything about it until he (Ivan) is certain beyond doubt of her guilt.Led by the Tsar's aunt, Efrosinia, the boyars now decide that their only option is to assassinate Ivan and enthrone her son, Vladimir (Pavel Kadochnikov). The novice Pyotr is selected to wield the knife.Ivan, wanting to ascertain Efrosinia's guilt, invites Vladimir to a banquet with the Oprichnina. Vladimir doesnt want to go, but Efrosinia insists that he go and take Pyotr with him, thinking that a magnificent opportunity for the murder has arisen.Ivan gets Vladimir drunk while the Oprichnina sing and dance around them. Ivan manipulates Vladimir, telling him he is a dear cousin, that its too bad they aren't good friends who tell each other confidences. The drunk Vladimir mentions that his mother wants him to be Tsar, even though he himself doesn't want it. Later he lets on that there is a plot to kill Ivan. With this, Ivan is now absolutely sure that Efrosinia was his wife's poisoner.Fyodor Basmanov notices Pyotr leaving, someone who did not belong in the party, and signals Ivan.Ivan, pretending surprise at Vladimir's revelation, suggests to Vladimir that being Tsar is not so bad. He convinces Vladimir to try being Tsar for a while, and has the Oprichnina bring throne, orb, scepter, crown and royal robes. Vladimir is dressed up as Tsar and they all bow down to ""Tsar Vladimir.""Then Ivan tells Vladimir to lead them, in full regalia, to the cathedral to pray, as a Tsar should lead. With much hesitation and fear, Vladimir does. In the cathedral, the assassin runs up and stabs the mock Tsar, and is immediately seized by Fyodor and Malyuta.Ivan orders them to release Pyotr, and thanks him for killing the tsar's worst enemy. Efrosinia arrives, jubilant at the apparent death of Ivan, until she sees Ivan alive. Rolling the corpse over, she sees it is her own son, screeches in desperation while holding Vladimir in a pose reminiscent of Michelangelo's Piet√°.Ivan sentences her. Then, in a final soliloquy, Ivan proclaims that all his enemies within Moscow are vanquished so he can now concentrate to those outside."

tt0051813,"['Comedy', 'Drama']","Kathy O'Rourke is a ten-year-old child star at a Hollywood studio. The public loves her but those who work with her can't stand her. She is rude, obnoxious, and disrespectful. Orphaned at a young age, Kathy lives with her aunt, Harriet Burton. Miss Burton is cold and unloving toward Kathy. A campaign to publicize Kathy's latest picture is underway. Celeste Saunders, a magazine writer from New York, is coming to do a two-part article on Kathy. She requests that Harry Johnson, who works in studio publicity, be assigned to her. Harry is reluctant to accept the assignment as Celeste was his first wife. But his boss gives him no choice. Kathy's pictures pay their salaries and Harry is ordered to cooperate with Celeste. The Hollywood Christmas parade is coming up and Kathy has been chosen to sit beside Santa Claus. But for whatever reason, she doesn't want to do it. She refuses to pose alongside a poster advertising the parade. The photographer appeals to Harry. He goes to Kathy's trailer and tries to befriend her, but she sees through his act. She even stabs a hole in the poster with a pair of scissors. The next day he tries again but is honest with her this time. He needs her to be nice to Celeste so she won't write an unfavorable article. Kathy agrees on the condition that Harry fix it so that she doesn't have to be in the Christmas parade. He promises to speak to her aunt. Harry's wife Helen was a friend of Celeste after the divorce. In fact it was Celeste who introduced them. Helen asks Harry to bring Celeste back to the house for a drink. This involves explaining to their two sons, Tommy and Bo, just who Celeste is. The boys take it in stride and Harry warns them not to ask Celeste any nosy questions.Harry meets Celeste at her hotel but she is too tired to visit his home. She suggests they go to the hotel bar, and he forgets to call Helen. They get caught up on each other's lives and he shows her pictures of the boys. Celeste wonders what Kathy is really like, which makes Harry nervous. He isn't sure he can trust Kathy to keep her word. When Harry finally arrives home, Helen is waiting up. She is mildly angry at him for forgetting to call. They agree to invite Celeste to dinner the next evening. Harry doesn't want to leave Celeste and Kathy alone, so he tags along on the first interview. Kathy is charming to Celeste and shows her a dress she is making for her doll. The two seem to hit it off. But after Harry and Celeste leave, Kathy angrily throws the doll to the floor. Celeste is charmed by Harry and Helen's sons and says she sometimes regrets not having children. But Harry reminds her that she wasn't cut out for the domestic life. She mentions an opening on her magazine and urges Harry to consider it.The next day, Harry is horrified to discover that Celeste and Kathy have gone off together. Harriet does't know where they went. Harry asks her if she has arranged for Kathy to skip the parade. She told Kathy it was all right but has said nothing to the studio head, Mr. Faber. Nervously Harry waits for Celeste and Kathy to return. They spent the day on a fishing boat and Kathy caught the second-largest fish. For the first time, she is able to act like a kid. No one recognizes her and she has a lot of fun with Celeste. Over the next week, the two spend a lot of time together. Harry is relieved to know they are getting on so well but he believes it is all an act. Then it is time for Celeste to return to New York. She and Kathy have a tearful farewell at the studio. Celeste is so upset that she can't return to her hotel alone. She asks Harry to meet her for dinner. He can't because Helen is Christmas shopping and he has to stay with the boys. When Celeste insists, he asks his co-worker Ben to babysit. Helen is told that Harry must go to the O'Rourke household. When she arrives home, laden with packages, she finds the boys watching the Christmas parade on TV. There is Kathy, looking very glum, sitting next to Santa. Helen realizes that Harry lied to her. Celeste finishes packing while Harry waits. She decides to take a shower and suggests they eat in her room. While she is in the shower, Kathy telephones. She doesn't believe Harry when he tells her that Celeste is busy. Then she tells Harry that she is going to run away. Harry drops the phone, shouts to Celeste that he is going to the O'Rourkes, and dashes out of the room. Celeste doesn't hear him and is puzzled when she discovers he is gone.Harry spots Kathy walking down the street near her home, carrying a suitcase. She runs but he catches up and puts her into his car. Kathy tells him she was forced by her aunt to be in the Christmas parade and that she is going to Celeste's hotel. Harry refuses to take her there. When Kathy adds that if he takes her home she will run away again, he decides to take her to his home. Helen and the boys are shocked to see Kathy because it's all over the news that she has been kidnapped. The children are sent to the kitchen while Helen and Harry try to figure out what to do. Harry comes up with several impractical ideas. Helen suggests that he go to the O'Rourke home, get Harriet alone, and tell her what happened. Then she can get rid of the police and come to get Kathy. But he is unable to speak to Harriet alone. The house is crawling with police and reporters, plus Mr. Faber, the studio head. Harriet is weeping hysterically and under a doctor's care. When Harry identifies himself as a member of studio publicity, Detective Chavez, who is in charge, wonders if the kidnapping is really a publicity stunt. Mr. Faber assures him that anyone connected with the studio will be fired at once if that is the case. Chavez says the District Attorney will make sure such a person will never work again, period. Harry is forced to return home. Helen learned that Kathy ran away because her aunt made her be in the parade. Since she and Celeste are such good friends, Kathy wants to live with her. Helen points out that Celeste has a job and is away from home all day. By the time Harry arrives home, Kathy is asleep in the boys' room. Celeste telephones, upset because no one let her know Kathy was missing. She was leaving for the airport when her boss called from New York with the news. He told her to stay on and cover the story. The next morning, Kathy is told that Harry will drop her off near her aunt's. She must not say where she has been because it would get a lot of people in trouble. But the street is filled with children celebrating their Christmas vacation. Harry cannot possibly leave without Kathy being seen. Bo suggests returning her that night, but Harry and Helen won't let her be on the streets alone. Tommy suggests taking her to the back lot of the studio, that is next to a rarely-used road. He admits to having climbed over the fence into the lot one time and Harry yells at him. But Helen likes the plan and Kathy assures them she is not afraid to be in the studio at night. She will say she ran away and hid there. Harry goes to work. The phones are ringing off the hook. Celeste comes by, obviously shaken, and asks him to have lunch with her. He calls Helen to check on Kathy. She doesn't tell him that the boys cut off her braids so she would be disguised. Just as they are leaving for the commissary, Chavez shows up. He is exhausted from following up false leads. Ben asks if there is anything definite. Chavez reveals that a girl matching Kathy's description was seen in a green 1956 convertible. Harry starts to sweat as that is his car. That night, the Johnsons say goodbye to Kathy. Helen invites her to come back anytime but Kathy says her aunt won't let her. Helen promises to see what she can do to make it happen anyway. Just as they are leaving, carolers show up. Helen gives them treats but does not invite them inside as she usually does. Then Ben comes by to deliver Christmas gifts. Kathy hides in the kitchen. He expresses his disgust at how Kathy has managed to ruin everyone's Christmas. To his surprise, the boys order him to leave. At the studio back lot, Harry instructs Kathy to wait until the clock chimes eight and then walk to the guards at the front gate. This is to give him enough time to get home before she is found. He helps her climb over the barbed wire fence before driving away. Kathy is a little scared when a cat jumps out at her, but finds a quiet spot to eat the brown bag lunch the boys packed for her. Inside is Bo's baseball cap. Kathy puts it on and smiles. Just as she starts to eat a sandwich, a jeep drives up. It is the guards making rounds. Leaving her suitcase, Kathy runs behind a pillar. But she is seen by the guards, who think she is a boy. After a short chase they catch up with her. When Harry arrives home, Chavez is there. He demands to know why Harry hadn't told him he had a 1956 green convertible. He asks where Harry has been and Helen jumps in, saying that he has been delivering Christmas presents. When Harry points out that there are hundreds of cars like his in Los Angeles, Chavez says that only five belong to studio employees. He asks for the names of those to whom Harry delivered gifts. Just then the telephone rings. Kathy has been found. Chavez says he is going to find out what really happened to her. Harry insists on calling Celeste. Helen gives him the go-ahead to take the New York job if that is what he really wants. At the O'Rourkes', Kathy is surrounded by her aunt, a doctor, the police, and Mr. Faber. She sticks to her story of being at the studio, which no one believes. They want to know who cut her hair. She is overjoyed to see Celeste, who takes her upstairs to bed. Celeste finds Bo's baseball cap, with his name inside. After Kathy is asleep, she goes downstairs holding the cap. Everyone is gone and Harry is urging Harriet to forget the whole thing. Celeste angrily confronts them with the cap and accuses Harry of hiding Kathy at his house for a publicity stunt. Harriet is genuinely puzzled until Harry admits the part about Kathy being at his house is true. Harriet then moves to call the police but Harry stops her. He tells them the whole story. Harriet tells them to leave and never see Kathy again. Celeste says they will see her because Kathy will always manage to get to the people she loves. Harriet snarls that Kathy doesn't know the meaning of the word. She insists that Kathy was acting the whole time and leaves the room. Celeste asks Harry to call her a cab. He congratulates her for caring about someone other than herself for the first time. He admits to almost losing his head over her again but he now realizes what a wonderful life he has. Needless to say he will not be taking the New York job. After he leaves, Harriet re-enters the room and she and Celeste stare at each other.The next morning, Harry is awakened to the sound of children playing. When he comes into the living room, he is surprised to see Kathy and Celeste. She and Harriet had a cozy all-night chat with the result that Kathy can visit the Johnsons regularly. Ben stops by and is amazed to see Kathy, who wishes everyone a merry Christmas."

Mrs. Becker just loves to needle Kelly and remind her daughter that she isn't a very good judge of men, even crooked ones.Flo stops at a bar and is noticed by Philip Ashton (Jay Sayer). He was waiting for her, and invites himself to join her at her table for a drink and a chat. He explains that he is, ""A friend of Michael's...you call him Fandango, I believe."" He informs Flo that Howard blames Kelly for the botched bank job and he intends to kill him. Ashton also informs Flo that Fandango lost his arm. He closes with a warning that Howard and his new gang wants Kelly out of the bank robbery business.At the house, the girls are entertaining Kelly. Martha has taken a real shine to Kelly. When Flo gets back to the house she expresses her disapproval. She slaps Kelly and gets slapped in return as she is explaining that Howard intends to kill Kelly. Flo reminds Kelly that the botched job was Kelly's fault, but she helps him locate Howard and his new gang. Mrs. Becker continues to needle Kelly after which he visits Howard and his new gang and kills them all while they are playing poker. Kelly decides there isn't enough profit in bank robbery and decides more money can be made with kidnap for ransom.Flo and Kelly wait in their car outside a school to intercept a little girl. Sheryl Vito (Lori Martin as Dawn Menzer) is the last to exit the school. The kidnappers talk to the little girl while she looks for and waits on her nurse/governess, Lynn Grayson (Barboura Morris) who happens along just as the girl is abducted. Since the ransom note is already being delivered, Flo's suggestion to abandon the plan is overruled. They decide to kidnap both. While Flo escorts the girl into the car, Kelly pulls a gun on Lynn and coerces the nurse into the car. They drive off and meet up with another accomplice, Apple (Richard Devon). All but Flo leave in Apple's car. Flo goes home to pick up clothes and supplies. The gang holes up in a house in the country. Kelly explains the rules to Lynn, and under duress Lynn cooperates fully. A radio broadcast reports Lynn as being an accomplice in the kidnapping, as this was her first day on the job. Also reported is the fact that a ransom note was delivered to Mr. Andrew Vito (Robert Griffin), but no details were released.Flo arrives with her mom and dad in tow. Kelly is upset, as he doesn't like Flo's parents, but Mrs. Becker explains that, ""The child is probably cold, frightened, and hungry, and I'm not leaving until I see that she's all right."" Mrs. Becker brings the little girl a doll and reassures the pair they'll be all right if they just do as they are told. Lynn attracts the roving eye of Apple, who pesters her. His untoward sexual attention is deflected by Kelly's intervention with his machine gun. He orders Apple to, ""Go outside and look around."" Lynn thanks Kelly and is informed she will be a lot of trouble. Mr. Vito's voice comes in on the radio. He is speaking to the gang and tells them he wasn't able to get the phone number to contact them. Flo is sent back to the store to contact her father to make another call to Mr. Vito.At the local general store the owner is talking to the local policeman, Freddy (Ted Thorpe). Flo walks in to exchange cigarettes she purchased earlier, and to make her phone call. Freddy talks to Flo to inquire about who she is and why she's in the area. Flo asks for a sack of flour to be put in the car. This task gives her a chance to make her phone call unheard. The cop noses around her car, then sees her off. After she drives away, the cop returns to the store to call in. He suspects something and asks the operator about the last call made from the general store phone. He then asks to be connected to the state police to report his findings. When Flo gets back and tells her story about the cop, Kelly gets suspicious and decides to take everyone to Harry's gas station.The two detectives get a lead on the bar where Flo met with Philip Ashton. They check up on anyone associated with Maize or Howard, now both dead. At the gas station Kelly decides to add Fandango to the caper. He intends to clean up some loose ends and knows given the opportunity Fanny will seek revenge. He wants Fanny to pick up the money from Mr. Vito. Flo and Kelly get into an argument about their life together. Kelly strikes Flo, which brings Apple to her rescue. He knocks Kelly to the floor. Apple asks Flo, ""Flo, baby, you want a new man now?"" ""Sure,"" is her response. Harry helps Kelly to his feet and gets rebuffed for his trouble. Kelly gives Harry a beating, and as Apple intervenes, Kelly draws his gun on him. The treacherous Flo returns to Kelly, leaving Apple angry, confused and unarmed. Kelly shoots and kills Apple and asks Harry to remove the body. Kelly phones Fandango to engage his services for the ransom pick up. Fanny, now missing his left arm, agrees and leaves the bar. He is picked up and taken to police headquarters. He is questioned, but isn't very cooperative and escapes before he can be followed. A short time later he calls the police to tell them of Kelly's involvement in the kidnapping. Kelly sends Harry to escort Fanny back to the gas station after he collects the money. Kelly doesn't trust Fanny and he is right in his assessment. He informs Flo that he intends to kill his hostages and leave the country with the money.The police arrange the drop and order the arrest of Flo's parents. Mr. Vito drops the money into a trash barrel and a short time later Fanny picks it up and departs the area. Harry intercepts his quarry and escorts him back to the station at gun point. Kelly awakes on the bottom bed of a bunk bed and images he's in a coffin. He panics and begins screaming and shooting. Fanny makes a run for the door but is stopped by Harry. The police announce they've surrounded the station. Fanny gleefully volunteers that he ratted them out. He eggs Kelly on to shoot it out with the police. That gets him shot and killed by Harry. Harry then shoots at the police and is killed by their marksmen. Flo then confronts the police and threatens to kill the hostages. She is informed her parents are under arrest. His cowardice showing, Kelly thinks he can negotiate with the police to avoid death. Kelly knocks Flo out, blaming her for all his troubles. The police enter and arrest Kelly and Flo and free the hostages. We close with a close up of Kelly's machine gun on a card table."
tt0051899,"['Drama', 'Romance', 'Western']","Link Jones (Gary Cooper rides into the small town of Crosscut, Texas. He sees a beautiful woman (Julie London) leaving the local saloon; they are taking down the sign advertising her as a singer. He gets a meal, and then hires someone to take care of his horse for a few days. He says he's Link Jones from Good Hope, which is five days' ride west. Then he drops his money bag, and we see he is wary about the money. Then he washes up and changes his clothes, and after thinking it over, puts his money bag and his holster and pistol in his satchel.Link heads to the train station and buys a ticket to Fort Worth. There he sees that Billie Ellis (London) is also boarding the train, and he meets Sam Beasley (Arthur O'Connell), a loquacious gambler. The local sheriff seems to recognize Link and asks his name. Link gives a different name, Henry Wright, and says his home town is Sawmill. The sheriff asks if he knows Dock Tobin, but Link denies knowing the name.
On the train, Beasley is friendly and talkative, and gets Link to tell him that he is traveling to Fort Worth to hire a schoolteacher. Talking loudly, Beasley observes that you would have to pay someone a year's salary in advance in order to get them to travel so far to such a remote place. Link replies that yes, he has the townspeople's money. A shady character Alcutt hears it all.The train stops to load wood and all able-bodied men are asked to help. The train guard assures that Link he'll watch his bag. But it's an ambush; four men lay in wait for the train, and the shady character is part of the gang. Separated from his gun, Link gets knocked out, and Alcutt takes his satchel off the train. The train guard manages to fight off the bandits, wounding Alcutt, and the train takes off.When Link comes to, he realizes he's been left behind, and soon he finds that Miss Ellis and Mr. Beasley are in the same predicament. They begin to walk with Link telling them the nearest town is about a hundred miles away.Link leads the trio to a farmhouse, and says he lived there once long ago. He sends his companions to wait in the barn while he cautiously approaches the house. But the would-be train robbers are waiting in the dark, guns drawn, and Link is caught. The situation is tense, when from the back room comes an old man (Lee J. Cobb) who introduces himself as Link's uncle Dock Tobin. Dock reminisces about what a great gang he had when Link was his right hand, and how enraged he was when Link left him all while Link is at gunpoint. He says he wants to rejoin Dock, but guns remain pointed at him.Meanwhile, the wounded Alcutt is dying. Dock insists one of his men put him out of his misery, and at last Coaley shoots him.With the tension still high, they agree that Link will stay, and Link brings in his friends from the barn. Immediately, Beasely is put to work digging a grave. Dock asks if Billie is Link's woman and to protect her, he says yes. Then Link is sent to take out the body. While outside he hears Billie Ellis begin screaming. Link runs back to find that Coaley has her at gunpoint, demanding she undress for the pleasure of them all. When Link tries to intervene, Coaley holds a knife to his throat, drawing blood. Billie removes her shoes, stockings, blouse, skirt, and undershirt, and is wearing only her undergarments when Dock ends the show and allows Link to take Billie to sleep in the barn.In the barn, Link helps Billie get into bed, where she sobs while he tries to comfort her. It is here that Billie begins to fall for Link, who is distraught because he has lost all the townspeople's money. He says he has a wife and two children (ages 8 and 10) at home and he speaks of them with deep affection. Billie says his wife is a very lucky woman.In the morning, Claude (John Dehner) arrives. Coaley and Claude are brothers and Link's first cousins.Dock wants to rob a bank in Lassoo, a bank he says is loaded with money. Now that Link is with them again, he's sure that they can pull off the job. They ride off in three wagons with two on horseback towards Lassoo.When they stop for a break, a ""friendly"" bit of wrestling turns into a murderous fight between Coaley and Link. Coaley fights dirty in every possible way, but Link gets the upper hand. He can't bring himself to kill, but Link strips Coaley in the same order he forced Billie to strip and leaves him humiliated. Coaley draws his gun and ignores Dock's order to stop. Beasely leaps jumps in front of Link to save him and is shot by Coaley, who is then shot by Dock.Link tells Billie that the folks in Good Hope know all about his murderous past, and he's ""broken his back"" working to establish himself with them as a decent man. Now, among this gang, he feels he wants to kill them, but he knows if he does, then he's no different from them.Dock's plan is to send one man into Lassoo to case the bank. If the man feels that they can take the bank, then he will wait in town; otherwise, he will ride back. The rest of the gang is to wait four hours, and if the man doesn't ride back, they will ride into Lassoo to meet him, find out how many guns await them, get the layout from their scout, and proceed to get rich. Link convinces Dock that he's the only man who can be the scout: Claude and Dock are known on sight in these parts, Trout (Royal Dano) is mute, and Ponch (Robert J. Wilke) is too stupid. Dock reluctantly agrees but sends Trout along with him.When they arrive, they find that Lassoo is a ghost town, and a scared Mexican woman lives in the former bank. She holds a gun on the two men, terrified, but while Link tries to reassure her, Trout shoots and kills her. Enraged, Link kills Trout with the dead woman's gun. She has no ammunition, so Link gets Trout's guns and gun belt and waits. He also searches Trout, but doesn't find his money.Claude and Ponch ride into Lasso. A tense, exciting battle follows; Link kills both men and is wounded in the left arm. Again, he searches fruitlessly for the money. As he is leaving, a Mexican man rides up; Link just says ""I'm sorry."" As Link rides off, we hear the husband's grief as he finds his beloved Juanita dead.Back at camp, Link finds Billie stripped and weeping. It appears that she has been molested despite Dock's promise to keep her safe. Link goes after Dock, wanting to take him in alive, but he is forced to return Dock's fire and kills him. His search over, Link gratefully pockets the money from the townspeople of Good Hope.As they drive away together from the awful scene, Billie thinks that Link will be treated as a hero. She says that she regrets nothing because she's never loved before, and although she knows that Link cannot return her love, to have the feeling is worth it."

tt0051989,['Comedy'],"1960. Montpaillard, a quiet little French town, known for his good wines. It calls itself ¬´The quietest town in France¬ª. The only one not to find it so quiet is Parju (Fran√ßois-Alexandre Galepides, known as Moustache), the official gamekeeper of the town, who is the constant victim of Blaireau (Louis de Fun√®s), the local poacher. When he walks back downtown, with his uniform all messed-up by Blaireau's last joke, everyone makes fun of him : Auguste (Lucien Hubert) the barrel-maker, Mr Lerechigneux (Robert Vattier) the judge, Ma√Ætre Guilloche (Jean-Marie Amato) a lawyer and the head of the opposition at the town council, Mr Bluette (Pierre Mondy) the director of the local prison, and most of the inhabitants of the town.The only one not to find it funny is the conservative Mayor of the town, Mr Dubeno√Æt (Fr√©d√©ric Duvall√®s). He loves peace and order, and he would like to get rid of the only troublemaker of the town, the poacher Blaireau. After telling Parju to do everything to catch Blaireau, he goes, along with Mr Bluette, to a bridge game in his friend's castle, the Count L√©on de Chaville (Roland Armontel) and his wife, the Countess (Madeleine Barbul√©e).At the castle, they meet Arabella de Chaville (No√´lle Adam), the Count's daughter, who drives around town on her motorcycle, frightening the population. The Count tells his friend the Mayor he would like to marry her as soon as possible.Before going up to her room, Arabella steals a bottle of alcohol from a servant's tray. The servant then brings the tray to the card table and asks the Countess how she wants the pheasant cooked. The mayor gets a bit mad, when he understands the pheasant comes from the poacher Blaireau.Meanwhile, Blaireau is walking in the forest, getting game from the various traps he has set around, with the help of his small black and white dog.Meanwhile, the four same people are still playing bridge when they are interrupted by the arrival of Armand Fl√©chard (Claude Rich). Fl√©chard is Arabella's piano teacher. He is also very much in love with Arabella, but never told her and only sends her anonymous love letters.In her bedroom, Arabella is smoking, drinking, reading thrillers and listening to music. She stops the music when Fl√©chard enters the room. She starts playing the piano, but, annoyed by Fl√©chard's comments, she slams the lid of the piano on his fingers.Blaireau is back in his little wooden house in the woods. He shares his meal with his dog and with his tame magpie. Then, he starts dressing to go and give out his poached game to his customers. The magpie knows how to talk a little and helps him to hide the game under his jacket. Before he leaves his house, he goes in his garden to feed his pig, whom he has called ¬´Parju¬ª. The real human Parju watches him, hidden in a bush, and doesn't seem to like to have a pig named after him. But Parju's metal badge shines in the sun and Blaireau spots him. Before leaving, Blaireau whispers something to his dog.Blaireau and his dog start walking across the forest, discreetly followed by Parju. But suddenly, Parju doesn't see Blaireau anymore. The poacher is hiding inside a hollow tree. Parju hears the dog barking and follows it. When Parju is gone, Blaireau comes out of his hiding place and walks away, in the opposite direction from Parju.The dog keeps on hiding, making Parju run all around the forest. Meanwhile, Blaireau can discreetly give his game to his customers. One of them is the most famous restaurant in Montpaillard, who takes two hares and two pheasants.When he has seen his last customer, Blaireau enters a bistro to drink a glass of wine. His dogs comes in shortly after him, followed by Parju, dripping with sweat. Parju walks slowly to the bar, orders a beer, and Blaireau, supposedly seeing a fly on the beer foam, blows all the foam in Parju's face.At the Chaville castle, both parents are trying to find a fianc√© for their daughter, but none of the young men in Montpaillard is male enough for her.In Montpaillard town hall, the town council is in session and the mayor and his opponent, Ma√Ætre Guilloche, are fighting over Blaireau, Guilloche accusing the mayor not to do what is necessary to get rid of Blaireau.In a river near Montpaillard, Blaireau is catching trouts with his bare hands. Parju, hidden behind a bunch of reeds, sees him and takes off his boots and his belt to go in the water to catch him, but he drops his metal badge on a stone, and Blaireau spots him. So, when Parju reaches the river, there is no more Blaireau in sight. Blaireau, who is hiding underwater, twists Parju's toe, and Parju runs away, thinking he has been bitten by a snake.Next day is market day in Montpaillard. Blaireau is selling mushrooms, but actually, hidden under his low bench, are two baskets full of the trouts he caught the day before. Parju, who feels that something is afoot, hides behind a nearby stall and sees Blaireau giving plenty of fish to L√©ontine (Monette Dinay), the mayor's servant. He walks around the stalls to the place where Blaireau is sitting and looks under the bench, but the fish baskets are gone. Looking desperately for the baskets, Parju breaks the stall of a nearby butcher. He has to walk away, and, when he is gone, Blaireau whistles at his dog, who brings the baskets back.A little further away, near a bookshop, the mayor is telling off Parju for breaking the butcher's stall and not catching Blaireau. Arabella enters the bookshop to buy new thrillers. Fl√©chard enters behind her and try to hide a love letter in one of the book, but, as Arabella keeps changing her mind about the books she wants to buy, he doesn't succeed. A little further away, he eventually succeeds in putting his letter in a bunch of roses she is buying.A little later, Fl√©chard is alone in Arabella's room, and sees his note on Arabella's desk. He also sees a lot of pictures and even a statue of very manly young men. And when Arabella tells him that there is not one real male in Montpaillard, he walks away.Next day, the mayor has invited his friends for lunch : Mr Bluette, the judge and the Count de Chaville. L√©ontine serves them the trouts she had bought the day before, but when the mayor understands they come from Blaireau, he almost suffocates.To-day is the official opening of the fishing season in Montpaillard, and everyone is gathered in the town main bistro, to join the fishing contest. Parju is seated at a table to write the names of all the contestants,. When he doesn't want to write Blaireau's name on the list, Ma√Ætre Guilloche has to order him to do it.The contest is held on a large river near Montpaillard, and Ma√Ætre Guilloche, president of the contest, is seated at a table on a bridge, with Parju at his side. Every man in the town is there, including Mr Bluette, the judge, Fl√©chard, and of course, the mayor and Blaireau, who are seated next to each other on the riverside. If the mayor has brought a very heavy equipment, Blaireau came with his hands in his pockets. He makes a fishing line out of the branch of a tree, and the float of his line out of a match and one of his jacket buttons.Blaireau throws his amateur line in the water, stamps his foot three time on the ground and pulls a very big fish. With the same method of foot-stamping, he catches a good dozen of big fishes, when all the other contestants catch nothing or a few very small fishes.Ma√Ætre Guilloche owns a local newspaper, ¬´L'Eveil de Montpaillard¬ª, in which he tells about the fishing contest, making the whole population of Montpaillard crack up laughing.The only one who doesn't laugh is the mayor, but he feels a little better when Parju walks in the town hall to tell him he has caught Blaireau. Unfortunately, he has only caught Blaireau's dog, but he expects to catch Blaireau with the dog.Fl√©chard, fed up with Arabella's poor playing, kicks her out of his house, and decides it is time to prove her he is a real man.Blaireau is walking along the side of a lake, unsuccessfully calling his dog. Suddenly, he sees Parju coming on his bicycle with the dog tied to the handlebar. Parju has not seen him and Blaireau can work out his revenge on Parju.Parju drops his bicycle and lets the dog guide him to a rabbit caught in a hidden trap. He tells the dog to bring the rabbit to Blaireau and follows it. The dog leads him to the lake, where Blaireau is apparently sleeping in a small rowboat in the middle of the lake. There is another rowboat by the side of the lake, and Parju climbs in it with the dog and the dead rabbit. What Parju doesn't know is that Blaireau has set a trap on the boat. As soon as the heavy Parju is inside the boat, the plug in the bottom of the boat pops off and water starts pouring into the boat.When Parju reaches Blaireau's boat, his own boat is so full of water that it drowns, while the dog swims to his master's boat. Blaireau takes his dog and rows away.Later in the evening, Parju is trying to dry his clothes, but Blaireau, hidden high in a nearby tree, steals them with a fishing line.It is now 11:30 p.m. and Parju, dressed with a loincloth made out of grass and twigs, is trying to sneak back home, but he meets the mayor, who immediately understands what happened. The mayor tells him to go and get new clothes and catch Blaireau, even if he has to be out all night.At midnight, Parju, fully dressed comes out of his house, while, in her bedroom, Arabella is reading Fl√©chard's anonymous letter, telling her to be at midnight near the wine press. Meanwhile Fl√©chard is coming out of his house to meet Arabella.Arabella goes near the wine press in the castle park, while Fl√©chard climbs over the park wall to meet her. But, on the other side of the wall, instead of dropping on solid ground, he drops on a small glass greenhouse. The noise he makes frightens Arabella who runs back to her room, but it also attracts Parju who jumps on Fl√©chard as he climbs back over the wall. Fl√©chard wins the fight, gives Parju a black eye and steal his official badge away from him.Next day, the mayor wants Parju to tell he was attacked by Blaireau, but Parju answers that it was so dark that he doesn't really knows who attacked him. The mayor orders him to charge Parju, and calls higher authorities to send him some reinforcement to arrest Blaireau. A few hours later, a dozen gendarmes arrive at the town hall to help the mayor make his arrest. Meanwhile, at the castle, the Countess tells her daughter about Blaireau coming in the park during the night and beating Parju.When Blaireau comes back to his wooden house in the forest after fishing on the lake, he is arrested by the gendarmes and brought in front of the judge Lerechigneux, who sends him to jail for a month.In the prison, Mr Bluette, the director makes a very warm welcome to Blaireau. It is a strange prison, where all the doors are open, and where prisoners are working as carpenters, tailors or even podiatrists. They all seem very happy, and tell Mr Bluette about their little health problem or their families. Bluette tells Blaireau to choose his own cell and then trusts him to Victor (Paul Faivre), the head-guard, who, like Mr Bluette, seems to be also a very sweet and nice man, and very friendly with the prisoners.Arabella tells her father she is going to marry Blaireau. When the mayor hears about it, he almost suffocates to death.During the night, Blaireau's dog is whining outside the prison. Bluette is reading the French prisons regulations book, and he tears off the page concerning the prisoners not being allowed to have pets, and lets the dog in. Meanwhile, Fl√©chard makes nightmares about Blaireau and Arabella.In the Chaville castle, Arabella is putting plenty of good things (wine, salami, cakes, etc.) into a box to give it anonymously to Blaireau, under the label ¬´Helping the prisoners¬ª. When her father sees her doing it, he gets very mad, but can't prevent her doing it.Fl√©chard is reading an old book about prisoners being chained day and night to the walls of their cells and given only bread and water to eat and drink. But Blaireau's actual situation is quite different. His cell is full of good food and wine, and he even has cigars to smoke.Downtown, Parju is getting bored stiff not having Blaireau around anymore. Ma√Ætre Guilloche thinks that, without Blaireau, the town looks like a school of shellfishes. The best restaurant in town, without Blaireau's poaching, has none of his usual feature dishes to serve to its customers. The only one to be happy in the town is the mayor.In the prison, Bluette leads Blaireau to the small stream crossing the prison gardens, and asks him to catch crawfishes in it. Next day, all the prisoners are eating crawfishes for lunch, when Victor, the head-guard walks in with another of Arabella's anonymous parcels in his hands. Blaireau opens it and shows his fellow-prisoners all the goodies inside. Victor goes back to the prison gate, where Fl√©chard gives him another parcel for Blaireau. It is labelled ¬´Protection of Innocence¬ª which pleases Blaireau, and inside, Blaireau finds a beautiful silk night-robe.A few days later, Blaireau tells Bluette it is the new moon, and that all the traps he hid in the forest are going to be full. Bluette first refused to let him spend a night in the forest and then asks him to go with him. Bluette is very happy to play the amateur poacher. When Parju, who was walking aimlessly in the forest, see them both dancing in a clearing, he thinks he is ill and goes back home to lie in his bed.Meanwhile, Bluette and Blaireau are back at the prison gate, but Bluette realizes he has forgotten his keys. Then they see all the other prisoners coming back to the prison, led by Victor, who has taken them to the movie theatre. But Victor has also forgotten his keys. Fortunately, one the prisoners is able to open the door with his pocket knife !A few days later, the doctor tells Parju he is now fit to leave his bed et go out. He also tells him that Blaireau is coming out of jail the next day and that he, too, has been ill. Actually Blaireau is ill because he ate too much of the good food sent to him by Arabella and Fl√©chard.Incidentally Arabella and Fl√©chard are each bringing another parcel to Blaireau, she riding her motorcycle, and he on his slower Solex bicycle. They hit each other at the corner of two streets, and find out they are both sending parcel. Fl√©chard explains he is the one who actually attacked Parju and he shows Parju's official badge to prove it. Then he tells Arabella he is also the one who is sending her anonymous love letters. Arabella answers that, if he goes to jail, she will immediately fall in love with him. The mayor, who heard the conversation, tries to stop him, but he doesn't want to listen to him. Ma√Ætre Guilloche also heard the conversation and wants to tell the whole town about this miscarriage of justice.But when Fl√©chard asks the ¬´procureur de la R√©publique¬ª (which would be the ¬´prosecutor¬ª or ¬´district attorney¬ª in the US) to send him to jail, the procureur (Pierre Stephen) answers that, for the moment, he is thinking about his holidays with his family and not about sending people to jail.Next day, in the Chaville castle, Arabella is making a parcel for her new fianc√©, Armand Fl√©chard, to the great annoyance of her father.Meanwhile, Blaireau is saying good-bye to Bluette, because he is leaving the prison. But, as he is almost out of the building, Bluette calls him back because he just got a letter explaining that Fl√©chard, and not Blaireau, is guilty of assaulting Parju. The French justice is so weird that now, Blaireau has to go back to jail until his innocence becomes official.Arabella wants to bring her parcel to Fl√©chard, but she sees Fl√©chard still in the street outside the prison and trying to get inside. He even gives his badge back to Parju, who just kisses him to thank him ! Eventually Fl√©chard goes to Bluette's office to ask him to put him in jail. And Blaireau also walks into the office to ask Bluette to put him out of jail. Bluette gets mad, puts Blaireau in a real locked cell and kicks Fl√©char out of the prison building.Ma√Ætre Guilloche tells the whole Blaireau story in his newspaper, and then he organizes a celebration for Blaireau's coming out of jail. The whole population of Montpaillard is in the streets, making a triumph to Blaireau, who is driven in an open convertible car, with Guilloche at his side, from the prison to the fun-fair. Montpaillard being in the heart of a vineyard district, many barrels of wine have been set for the population to enjoy them.An hilarious mayor tells Guilloche that the next mayor of Montapaillard will be neither himself, nor Guilloche, but Blaireau. Guilloche doesn't find the prospect funny.Blaireau is asked to start the cycle race, but he doesn't want to use the gun they give him, and which he puts in his pocket. Then he helps Arabella to climb on the merry-go-round, where she meets Fl√©chard, whom she asks when he is going to jail.Parju can't believe his eyes when he sees Blaireau having a drink with the mayor, the judge and Guilloche. But Blaireau has to leave his new friends to go and give his prize to the winner of the cycle race. Then Blaireau dances a bit with the Countess, and then he has a chat with Fl√©chard, who tells him about his love problems.

Distressed that they will once again be late for church, the boy's aunt Hagar hides the instrument and rushes him into the Methodist Episcopal Church, where his father, Charles Handy, is the minister. Will plays the organ as the choir sings a hymn, but the bluesy feel of Hagar's singing angers Rev. Handy, and he cuts the song short. Bellowing from the pulpit, Rev. Handy proclaims, ""There are only two kinds of music in this world: the devil's and the Lord's."" After church, the minister tells his son that he would rather see him dead than making music for the devil. Years pass, and Will returns home from his studies. His sweetheart Elizabeth, whom he plans to marry, is distressed when he confesses that he played with bands and minstrel shows during school vacations. Not wishing to see Will anger his father, Elizabeth encourages him to apply for a teaching position. Will agrees to this plan, but soon afterward, enters a friend's bar and begins to play the piano. When a white man offers him money to play for a political rally, Will enthusiastically writes a song for the candidate, ""Sheriff Honest John Baile."" He quickly assembles a band, which, along with the song, is so successful that nightclub singer Gogo Germaine invites him to play at the club of her boyfriend Blade. The combination of Gogo's singing and Will's songs is an instant hit, but the young musician keeps this news from his father. One day a lawyer appears and buys the rights to Will's song ""Yellow Dog Blues"" for an unnamed client. Will's next song is ""Careless Love,"" and as he rehearses it with Gogo, she realizes that he is attracted to her but cautions him not to let his feelings interfere with their music. Bessie May, a choir member who cleans up at the Big Rooster Club, is horrified to see Will at the piano and tells his father everything. Will tries to explain that the music he plays is the music of their people, and when Rev. Handy forces his son to choose between him and the club, Will reluctantly rents a room on Beale Street. Will writes the popular ""St. Louis Blues"" and ""Chantez les Bas,"" but misses Elizabeth and his family. One day a publisher offers him six hundred dollars for the recording rights to ""Yellow Dog Blues,"" but Will learns that because Blade had earlier bought full rights to the song for only fifty dollars, he no longer owns it. Furious, Will fights with Blade, but Gogo reminds him that there will be other songs. When royalty checks do begin to appear, Will, remembering his deceased mother's wish for a piano, buys a beautiful instrument for his father and plays ""Morning Star"" on its keys. Rev. Handy is unmoved, however. Gogo announces that she and Will have been offered work in New York, but after she leaves, Will buries his head in his hands and tells Elizabeth that he has gone blind. Believing that the affliction is God's punishment for his evil music, Will moves home and begins to write hymns for the church. As Bessie May sings one of them, ""Steal Away to Jesus,"" his sight suddenly returns, and ""Prof. W. C. Handy"" begins to offer piano lessons. Dissatisfied with this profession, Will restlessly takes a walk one day. Passing a club, he hears Ella Fitzgerald and the Memphis Jazz Quartet perform his ""Beale Street Blues."" At home, Hagar sings his ""St. Louis Blues,"" but when he imagines his father's anger at the song, he runs from the house. After praying for guidance, Will leaves town and is soon performing throughout the Midwest as the leader of the W. C. Handy Trio.

Grayfish is on an anti-shipping patrol off the coast of Japan, under command of Barney Doyle (Glenn Ford) and his executive officer, Archer Sloan (Ernest Borgnine). Doyle is wracked with uncertainty over the fate of his wife and three-year-old daughter, who were still at home in the Philippines when the Japanese invaded. Meanwhile, the entire Pacific submarine force has standing orders to locate and sink the Japanese fleet aircraft carrier Shinaru, which (fictionally) led the attack on Pearl Harbor.Admiral Setton (Philip Ober), commander of the Pacific submarine force, and his intelligence staff receive word that Doyle's wife and daughter are alive, but being held in a Japanese POW camp in the northern Philippines. Not long thereafter, the Shinaru is located, returning to Tokyo - and straight into Doyle's line of fire. Unfortunately, Setton's intelligence people also learn that the Shinaru is being screened by a transport carrying American POWs, including Doyle's family, from the Philippines to Japan. Determined to penetrate the protective screen and sink the Shinaru, Doyle positions the Grayfish to attack.As it approaches Tokyo Bay, the Shinaru is still taking evasive maneuvers with the transport running interference. Passing the Grayfish's position, the risk of firing torpedoes at the Shinaru without hitting the transport is far too great, but Doyle is bent on taking the shot anyway. Over Sloan's protests, Doyle himself fires two torpedoes; one misses, but the other hits the transport and sinks it. He observes survivors in the water, but it is never clear whether his wife and daughter are among them. The escort destroyers pin the Grayfish down with depth charges, just long enough for the Shinaru to escape into Tokyo Bay.After eluding the destroyers, Doyle runs the Grayfish through the anti-submarine defenses at the entrance to the bay - including a submarine net and a thick mine field - and comes upon the Shinaru at anchor. He fires a torpedo spread, but the torpedoes are intercepted by a passing destroyer, bringing the Grayfish under counterattack again. Acting on a suggestion from Lieutenant Redley (Robert Hardy), a Royal Navy officer working with the Grayfish crew on its sonar gear, Doyle fires his stern torpedoes into the mine field, tricking the Japanese into thinking the Grayfish has hit a mine and sunk. The Grayfish thus escapes from the bay, and Doyle retires to his cabin to grieve.As Sloan guides the Grayfish back to Pearl Harbor, Doyle is unconscious for three days; the possibility that Sloan might share this with Admiral Setton gnaws at him. Upon return to Pearl, the Grayfish puts in for repairs as the crew takes their customary two weeks of rest and recreation. Thereafter, Setton informs Sloan that he has been promoted to lieutenant commander and is in line for command of his own submarine; but he also presses Sloan, who is forthright about Doyle's period of incapacity. However, Setton agrees to let Doyle and Sloan team up on one last attempt to sink the Shinaru.Doyle is livid when the Grayfish, in company with its sister submarine Bluefin, is deployed to the Aleutian Islands, but intelligence reports that the Shinaru is present in a harbor on Kiska. In an impenetrable fog at the harbor entrance, the Bluefin dives early, but the Grayfish, diving several minutes later, is damaged by a log and chain boom in its path. With the Shinaru at anchor - and invisible in the fog - Doyle and Sloan set up a torpedo attack relying on the sonar. Despite his earlier vow to sink the Shinaru himself, Doyle allows Sloan to fire the entire torpedo spread, which eventually hits and fatally holes the enemy carrier. A destroyer delivers a punishing depth charge attack, inflicting such severe damage to the Grayfish that it sinks to the bottom of the harbor with six men unaccounted for. Doyle assembles the survivors and organizes an escape using specialized submarine survival gear.Having dispatched the destroyer, the Bluefin surfaces to pick up the survivors of the Grayfish and to observe the Shinaru in its death throes."

The lead detective, the obese and lumbering Capt. Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles), rudely rebuffs Vargas' offer. However, Quinlan's partner, the loyal Sgt. Pete Menzies (Joseph Calleia), and Adair, a district attorney (Ray Collins), apologize for Quinlan's behavior and invite Vargas to observe their investigation because of his status as a highly placed Mexican government official.In the meantime, a group of young Mexican men working for ""Uncle"" Joe Grandi (Akim Tamiroff), a small-time crime boss with a bad toupee, bring Susan, an American, to Grandi's headquarters in a sleazy hotel. Grandi warns Susan of dire consequences if her husband continues his prosecution of Grandi's brother, an imprisoned drug dealer awaiting trial in Mexico, but Susan is unimpressed.While investigating the case on the Mexican side of the border, Quinlan visits the tawdry brothel run by Tanya, a former lover (Marlene Dietrich), and the place fills him with nostalgic yearnings. Upon learning of Susan's encounter with Grandi, Vargas decides that she will be safer stashed in a motel on the American side of the border while he continues working on the Linnekar case. However, unknown to Vargas, the motel is owned by Grandi, staffed by a very nervous night clerk (Dennis Weaver), in the middle of the desert.Quinlan soon tracks down a suspect, a Mexican shoe clerk who was having an affair with Linnekar's daughter, Marcia (Joanna Moore), and later married her in a secret ceremony. Sanchez (Victor Millan) claims he is innocent and appeals to Vargas for help. After a prolonged search, Quinlan declares that Menzies has found damning evidence of Sanchez's guilt concealed in a shoe box. Vargas, who had earlier seen that the box was empty, accuses Quinlan of planting dynamite in the box to frame Sanchez.Grandi approaches Quinlan to suggest that they work together to ruin Vargas and after Quinlan has downed several drinks at Grandi's prodding, they plot to destroy Vargas professionally and personally by framing Susan. Grandi's gang of young hoodlums, led by a sadistic woman (clad in black leather (Mercedes McCambridge), take over the motel and accost the terrified Susan, who is shot up with drugs and then transported to a room in Grandi's hotel.When Vargas meets with Police Chief Gould and District Attorney Adair to discuss his suspicions about Quinlan, the faithful Menzies doggedly tracks down his partner to inform him of the meeting. Quinlan storms in on the meeting and, furious that Gould is not defending him, makes a show of throwing down his badge. Uncomfortable with the fact that Vargas is an outsider making accusations against a star detective, Gould and Adair placate Quinlan by telling Vargas to stay out of police business. Al Schwartz, a young assistant D.A., stands by Vargas and secretly gains him access to Quinlan's case files, which strongly suggest that Quinlan, tortured by the fact that he was unable to find enough evidence to convict the suspect who strangled his wife, has been framing suspects for years. Unable to accept that his partner and best friend is crooked, Menzies attempts to defend Quinlan.Unable to reach Susan by phone, Vargas finally makes it to the motel to find the night clerk sitting in the dark and seemingly speechless with fear. To Vargas' horror, all that remains in Susan's room are the stench of marijuana smoke and the debris of a wild party.Meanwhile, Quinlan arrives at Grandi's hotel and enters the room where Susan lies unconscious, the smell of marijuana clinging to the clothing strewn about the floor. After forcing Grandi at gunpoint to telephone Menzies to report that he has found Vargas' wife surrounded by evidence of a drug party, Quinlan, who wants to ensure that he will not be a victim of blackmail, strangles Grandi with one of Susan's stockings.Soon after, Vargas, who has launched a desperate search for his wife, learns that Susan has been jailed on suspicion of drug use, prostitution and the murder of Grandi. Knowing that Quinlan is behind the frame-up and feeling helpless to stop him, Vargas explodes with rage, but Menzies takes him aside and reveals that he found Quinlan's cane at the murder scene. Although he is devastated by the fall of his idol, Menzies agrees to help Vargas amass more incontrovertible evidence of Quinlan's criminal activities and consents to being wired in the hopes that Quinlan will confess to his trusted partner.Quinlan, still on a binge, has holed up at Tanya's place where, in a drunken haze, he asks her to read his fortune. Tanya, however, sadly declares that his future is ""all used up"" and advises him to go home. As he reels out the door, Quinlan is confronted by Menzies, who begins asking questions about the Grandi murder while, nearby, Vargas records the conversation. As they walk toward a bridge spanning a murky canal, Menzies accuses Quinlan of betraying his loyalty by setting him up as the stooge who always found the planted evidence. The argument is interrupted when Quinlan hears the sound of their voices on Vargas' tape recorder and finally realizes that Menzies is wired. When Menzies tries to stop Quinlan from harming Vargas, who is clinging to the side of the bridge, Quinlan shoots him and then, in shock at what he has done, stumbles down to the canal to wash the blood from his hands.Vargas confronts Quinlan with the evidence he now has on tape, and Quinlan prepares to kill him so that he can pin the Menzies murder on him. However, Menzies, on the brink of death, manages to crawl to the edge of the bridge and shoot Quinlan. Schwartz arrives with Susan, who has been released from jail, and Vargas departs to take her home to Mexico City, knowing that he is leaving behind enough evidence to prove that Quinlan framed Susan, Sanchez and many others.

The Bosun denies knowledge and pretends to go and deal with the problem, telling the crew Fairweather knows about their activities but does not know who is responsible. Therefore, he persuades Barker to admit he is solely responsible, pretending that he is doing it for his poor family of 13 children. Fairweather believes and forgives him but orders all the animals and produce off the ship. The Bosun and the crew trick Fairweather by buying cooked chicken and and bacon and serving it to Fairweather for dinner, making him think they have killed and cooked the chicken and pig on his orders.That night Fairweather's crate of rockets and Susanne arrive at the ship. The rockets are brought on board by some of the crew while others load laundry behind Fairweather's back. Susanne reveals to Fairweather she has come to collect more food supplies and Fairweather realises their illegal activities are continuing. He orders the crew to assemble and the Bosun to bring the ship's logs to his cabin, where he sees evidence of their activities. A message arrives to say the ship is to be inspected so the Bosun blackmails Fairweather, mentioning that it was his car that transported the goods to the village and that he has knowingly been eating the food they have been producing so is complicit. The Bosun takes control and organises the crew to hide everything before the inspection and enlists Fairweather to go to the naval barracks to collect the next batch of rum from the supply depot.Admiral Foley arranges the inspection schedule and agrees to inspect HMS Berkeley as part of it. Fairweather drives to the navy barracks to collect the rum, arriving just before Foley and the Flag Lieutenant. On board the ship, the Bosun disguises Perkins in a commanding officer's uniform and tells him to pretend to be Fairweather. While Fairweather waits at the barracks for the right contact to arrive, Admiral Foley arrives for the inspection at the ship. He vaguely recognises Perkins but cannot remember him exactly so starts the inspection. Foley arrives back at the ship with his car full of rum so the crew quickly disguise him as a galley sailor. Foley vaguely recognises Fairweather too as he inspects the galley but cannot recall where from. However, when he shouts for the orderly back in the Fairweather's cabin, Perkins responds as the orderly and not as an officer. Now Foley remembers him and Fairweather and demands an explanation. Fairweather struggles to explain so Foley demands to inspect the log books where he sees the unusual supply entries. He searches the ship and finds the pigs and other goods. His vents his anger at them in the rocket room but in the process accidentally hits the launch button despite warnings from Fairweather. The rocket launches but comes straight back down and sinks the ship. In the water, Foley wants them punished but Fairweather and the Bosun compromise with him, saying it was he who sunk the ship because he launched the rocket.Fairweather and Susanne leave for Australia as the Bosun and the crew wave them off from their new ship: HMS Incorruptible."
tt0052357,"['Mystery', 'Romance', 'Thriller']","A woman's face gives way to a kaleidoscope of credits, signaling the start of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo to Bernard Hermann's haunting score.A criminal climbs up the rungs of the ladder to the rooftop on a dark San Francisco night. John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (James Stewart), a detective, and a police officer are hot on his trail. They chase him across the top of buildings. The thief jumps between two buildings, making it across. The police officer follows, but Scottie can't get his footing. He slips. Scottie hangs on to the gutter as his fear of heights kicks in. The police officer tries to help him and asks for his his hand, but the officer slips and falls to his death. Scottie witnesses this as he clutches the gutter.Months after the incident, Scottie reclines in the home of Marjorie ""Midge"" Wood (Barbara Bel Geddes), a painter and fashion illustrator. She is concerned about Scottie's plans now that he is back in shape. He has retired from the police force due to his acrophobia , and does not want to be a desk jockey. Midge and Scottie used to be engaged back in college, but it was broken off. Scottie blithely waves their engagement off as a flight of fancy, ended by Midge, but it's clear from Midge's expression that Scottie was more likely the unwilling party and that Midge still holds a torch for him. She urges him to take a vacation. ""Don't be so motherly"", responds Scottie. They discuss an old college buddy, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), who wants to meet with Scottie. Scottie attempts to gradually get over his fear of heights by using a step stool. He is able to handle the first two steps, but when he reaches the top, he looks out the window down into the street below and panics. He collapses in Midge's arms.
Scottie meets Gavin, who is in the shipping business. Gavin married into the business, and he wants Scottie to tail his wife. He does not suspect infidelity, but hints that his wife has been possessed by something. She's become distant and distracted and has taken to roaming the city and surrounding area. The no-nonsense Scottie initially dismisses the supernatural undertones of Gavin's worries, but is nevertheless intrigued. Gavin invites Scottie to observe him and his wife at Ernie's Restaurant the following night. Ernie's Restaurant is a lavish, upscale eatery, plush and scarlet. Scottie first spots Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) who is stunning, with platinum blonde hair, a black dress and a green shawl. He is mesmerized by her.The next morning, he stalks her outside her house. She wears a simple gray suit with white gloves, as she gets into her green automobile. Scottie follows her through the streets of San Francisco, as she visits a flower shop and purchases a small bouquet. He then trails her to the Mission Dolores, where she goes through the chapel to the cemetery, finally stopping to stand at a grave. As she exits, Scottie notes the headstone, which reads ""Carlotta Valdes born: December 3 1831 died: March 5 1857."" He then tracks her to the Palace of the Legions of Honour, an art museum. Madeleine sits, staring at a portrait for hours. Scottie notices that the bouquet she purchased is just like the one in the painting. Also, her hair is done exactly like the woman in the painting. Scottie discovers from the curator that the painting is titled ""Portrait of Carlotta"" and he is given a catalog of the paintings. Finally, he follows her to the McKittrick Hotel, where Scottie observes Madeleine in a second story window. Scottie enters the old hotel and asks the manager (Ellen Corby), who the occupant of the room is. She hesitates to tell him, until Scottie reveals his badge. The manager reveals that the woman's name is Carlotta Valdes, but that Miss Valdes has not been in the room all day. Scottie finds this impossible, and goes up to the room, which is indeed empty. He looks down the street to discover that her car is gone.Scottie returns to Midge's home where he asks her for a local historian expert. She tells him of San Francisco historian Pop Liebel (Konstantin Shayne), who owns the Argosy Book Shop. She and Scottie pay Pop a visit and Scottie asks the man about the McKittrick hotel. Pop tells Scottie that the hotel was originally a house built by a rich man for his mistress, Carlotta Valdes, and they had a child. However, the rich man eventually discarded Carlotta, keeping their child to raise with his childless wife. Carlotta went from depressed to insane, and finally took her own life.On the drive home, Midge and Scottie talk about the portrait; he shows her the catalog picture. The resemblance is uncanny. Another conversation with Gavin reveals that Madeleine had started to wear Carlotta's jewelry, particularly a ruby pendant shown in the painting. Madeleine's great-grandmother was Carlotta Valdes, a fact that Madeleine does not know. Gavin only knows this fact because Madeleine's mother told him.Scottie follows Madeleine the next day to the Palace of the Legions, where she gazes at the portrait. Then he follows her to Fort Point near the Golden Gate Bridge. Madeleine strolls by the shore, throwing petals into the bay, until without warning, she jumps in. Scottie dives after her. She is alive but unconscious, and he takes her back to his apartment.Madeleine wakes up at Scottie's apartment, perplexed and alarmed to find herself naked in a strange man's bed. Scottie hands her a red bathrobe and explains that he rescued her from drowning. Madeleine maintains that she must have fainted and fallen. He questions her, ""Has this ever happened to you before?"" Gavin calls, concerned about the whereabouts of his wife. Scottie reassures him that Madeleine is at his apartment. Gavin informs Scottie that Madeleine is twenty-six - the same age at which Carlotta Valdes committed suicide. Scottie hears the door close, and realizes that Madeleine has left. As Madeleine drives away from Scottie's house, Midge arrives just in time to have a misunderstanding. She believes that Scottie and Madeleine are in a relationship.The next morning, Scottie trails Madeleine through the streets of San Francisco, only to find that Madeleine has been looking for Scottie's house. Scottie catches her leaving a thank you letter for saving her. She did not know the address, but followed the Coit Tower. Scottie, now smitten with Madeleine, insists that they wander together, because they are both alone.They arrive at Big Basin Redwoods State Park, where they admire the ancient redwoods. As they view a cross-section of a tree with the approximate dates of historical events, Madeleine goes into a trance, seemingly becoming Carlotta, recounting the dates of her birth and death. Madeleine wanders deeper into the woods, and Scottie follows her. He confronts her about her jump into the bay, and tries to bring Madeleine back. By the shore, Madeleine begins to reveal fragments of her vague memories: an empty grave with no name, waiting for her; an empty room in which she sits alone; and finally a tower, bell, and garden in Spain. Madeleine admits she is not crazy; she does not want to die. They drive to the beach and kiss as the waves crash onto the rocks. Scottie promises he will never leave her.Scottie arrives at Midge's place upon having received a note from Midge inquiring as to his whereabouts. Midge mischievously reveals a new picture she's been painting-- a portrait of herself as Carlotta Valdes. Scottie is not amused by the gag. Distressed, he leaves immediately. Midge ruins the painting, upset by the depth of his feeling for Madeleine and her own misguided attempt to make light of it, which has distanced them further.Madeleine returns to Scottie's house, where she tells him of an awful dream, with a tower, a bell, and a village. As she describes the location in detail, Scottie finishes her descriptions. ""You've been there!"" he exclaims. Scottie is talking about the San Juan Bautista, a mission that has been converted into a museum. They drive to the mission.When they arrive at the mission, they enter the livery stable, where Scottie tries to dismiss the dreams logically. He points out certain objects that are real. They kiss. Madeleine explains she must do something. She asks him if he believes she loves him. He replies yes. ""And if you lose me, then you'll know I, I loved you. And I wanted to go on loving you,'' she says. She starts to go to the church, when Scottie realizes she is going to the bell tower. Scottie chases her into the chapel, and sees her run up the stairs. He follows her, but as he looks down, his vertigo sets in, paralyzing him. He cannot follow her up to the top of the bell tower. He watches, helpless, in fear and horror as Madeleine's body plunges to the tiles below. Scottie staggers out of the mission, sun blinding his eyes, dumbfounded.At the a judicial hearing concerning Madeleine's death, the judge is particularly cruel to Scottie; he insults him for letting his weakness get in the way of saving Madeleine. The court rules the incident a suicide. Gavin comforts Scottie, while telling him that, with the loss of his wife, he can no longer stay in San Francisco. Gavin sets off for Europe.Scottie has trouble sleeping. Blue and purple flashes signal his nightmare, as an animated bouquet unravels. He dreams of seeing Carlotta Valdes at the hearing, with special emphasis on the ruby necklace. Scottie walks into the cemetery where there is an open grave. Scottie falls into the grave, which has become precipitous, then his body lands next to Madeleine's on the tiles of the mission. He wakes up in a cold sweat.Midge arrives to care for Scottie in a psychiatric ward. She tries to comfort him, ""mother's here."" Scottie will not speak, he is in a daze. The doctor believes that Scottie will be incapacitated for a year due to stress and anxiety from his depression and guilt.Several months later, upon his eventual release from the hospital, Scottie remains in the grip of an obsession. He visits the old Elster home, and spots the green car. In the distance, a woman in gray suit is getting in it. Unfortunately for him, it is not Madeleine; it is an older neighbor who bought the car from Gavin. At Ernie's he spots a woman in a green evening dress, but again, it is not Madeleine. He even sees Madeleine at the Palace of the Legions, but once again, it is not her. While looking at a bouquet at a flower shop, he sees a striking brunette in a green dress who resembles Madeleine. He follows her to the Hotel Empire, and sees her through the fifth floor window.When Scottie knocks on the door, the woman is concerned that he is a creep. He reassures her he just wants to talk. He interrogates her rather aggressively, and she shows him proof that she is Judy Barton from Salina, Kansas. Judy realizes that Scottie's heart is broken for his former flame, and she takes pity on him. She agrees to go for dinner with him later at Ernie's.After Scottie leaves, flashbacks reveal Judy's memories. She was Madeleine, running up the steps of the bell tower. At the top, Gavin Elster was there, holding the body of the real Madeleine Elster, dressed in exactly the same outfit as Judy. It was the real Madeleine's body that was thrown off the bell tower, with Judy letting out the scream. Judy even keeps the gray suit that she wore as Madeleine Elster hidden in the back of her closet. She begins to write a letter to Scottie, explaining that she was Gavin's accomplice in the murder of his wife. She had pretended to be Madeleine to fool Scottie, and use him as a witness to lend credence to the idea that Madeleine was mentally unstable. Gavin had known about his vertigo, and knew that Scottie would never make it to the top of the bell tower. Judy reconsiders this letter, and tears it up, deciding she wants to be with Scottie rather than run away.That night, Scottie mistakes another patron for Madeleine at Ernie's. He escorts Judy home, her apartment flooded with the green neon light of the Hotel Empire sign. He's overwhelmed by his yearning for Madeleine, a woman lost to him, although through Judy he is able to capture the ghost of Madeleine's presence. They agree to meet the next morning and go out with Judy having to make some excuse to her employer.They engage in a series of dates, with Scottie becoming happier with the relationship. However, little by little, he begins to make Judy over in the image of Madeleine. He searches obsessively for the gray suit and white gloves that Madeleine used to wear and even convinces Judy to bleach her hair. Although Judy begs him to love her for herself, she is so in love with Scottie that she allows him to change her into Madeleine.After undergoing an extensive makeover, Judy returns to an anxiously awaiting Scottie. Scottie won't brook the slightest deviation from his recreation of Madeleine, and insists that Judy pin her now platinum blonde hair up exactly the way Madeleine wore hers, which she does, completing the transformation. In a dreamlike state, with the green glow all around them, they embrace and kiss. The room turns into the livery stable from the Mission, Scottie's last kiss with Madeleine, and then back to the apartment. Scottie has finally managed to turn back time and resurrect Madeleine from the dead.A couple of nights later, the two decide to go out to Ernie's. Judy dresses up, and puts on the same ruby pendant depicted in the portrait of Carlotta. Scottie realizes that something is amiss. He suddenly becomes distant. He suggests they not go to Ernie's and go south down the coast and continues driving past the redwood forest. He tells her he has one final thing to do. Judy is torn between her love for Scottie and the fear and guilt she feels over having colluded with Gavin Elster. They arrive at the mission, where Scottie forces Judy to re-enact Madeleine's last moments; their final kiss, Madeleine's parting words. He relentlessly pushes Judy up the stairs of the mission tower, discovering in the process that his vertigo is not as limiting as it was. He reveals to Judy that her putting on the necklace that belonged to Carlotta is what gave her away.As he reaches the top of the bell tower, he puts the whole puzzle together. He finally realizes that Judy was the counterfeit all along. He never knew the real Madeleine Elster. He was being set up as Gavin Elster's witness in the murder of Elster's wife. He pulls Judy to the top of the tower, where she protests. Judy pleads that she has fallen in love with Scottie. They kiss. The sudden appearance of a women in the shadows, however, startles Judy, who steps backwards and plummets to her death off the ledge. A nun steps into the light and in the final shot, as the nun tolls the death bell, a devastated Scottie stands frozen in despair, having now lost the same woman twice, and this time... forever."

As the American soldiers Ackerman and Whiteacre go through training to eventually be sent to fight for their country, their story is balanced by the German soldiers Diestl and Capt.

Ultimately the forces at work are reduced to a personal level as the human quality in Man supersedes the ravages of war."
tt0052561,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, small-town lawyer Paul Biegler (James Stewart), a former district attorney who lost his re-election bid, spends most of his time fishing, playing the piano and hanging out with his alcoholic friend and colleague Parnell McCarthy (Arthur O'Connell) and sardonic secretary Maida Rutledge (Eve Arden).One day Biegler is contacted by Laura Manion (Lee Remick), wife of the loutish US Army Lieutenant Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara). The Lieutenant has been arrested for first degree murder, that of innkeeper Barney Quill. Manion does not deny the murder but claims that it was committed because his wife was raped and beaten by Quill.Even with such a motivation, it would be difficult to get Manion cleared of murder, so Biegler pushes him into a position where he claims to have no memory of the event, thus giving them a chance of winning his freedom on the grounds of ""irresistible impulse"", a version of a temporary insanity defense.As he sets about preparing his case, Biegler catches Laura Manion flirting with other army officers during a roadhouse party. He has to practically order her to stay away from ""men, juke joints, booze, and pinball machines"" and wear a girdle in order to play the part of a ""meek little housewife"" rather than that of a happy-go-lucky party girl. She also agrees to give up her tight-fitting clothes and wears a formal dress, glasses, a hat and a woman's suit in court.Biegler's folksy speech and laid-back demeanor hides a sharp legal mind and a propensity for courtroom theatrics that has the judge busy keeping things under control. However, the case for the defense does not go well, especially since the local D.A. (Brooks West) is assisted by a high-powered big city prosecutor named Dancer (George C. Scott). Furthermore, the prosecution goes all the way to block any mention of Manion's motive for killing Quill - the raping of Laura. Biegler eventually manages to get the rape issue into the record and Judge Weaver (Joseph N. Welch) agrees to allow the matter to be part of the deliberations. However, Dancer's cross-examination of Laura effectively portrays her as a woman who was not satisfied with her marriage and openly flirted with other men, including the one she claimed raped her.A doctor casts doubt on whether she was raped or not, though Biegler questions the method he used to obtain the results, and psychiatrists give conflicting testimony to Manion's state of mind when he killed Quill. Furthermore it comes out that even Lt. Manion doubted his wife, as Laura, a Catholic, had to swear on a rosary to persuade her husband that the sex with Quill was indeed non-consensual.Quill's inn is due to be inherited by Mary Pilant (Kathryn Grant), a mysterious Canadian who is suspected of being his mistress. Biegler's friend and colleague Parnell McCarthy makes inquiries and discovers that she is in fact Quill's daughter but is anxious to keep this secret since she was born out of wedlock. Biegler, who is losing the case, tries to persuade her that Al Paquette (Murray Hamilton), a bartender who witnessed the murder, knows that Quill raped Laura but is covering this up, either out of love for Mary or loyalty to his late friend. Through Mary, Biegler tries to persuade Paquette to testify for the defense on these grounds but he refuses. Annoyed, Biegler leaves saying: ""I'll leave a pass for you and Al at the trial. You might like to watch Lt. Manion get convicted.""Mary does actually attend the final day of the trial when the issue is raised about the panties that Laura was wearing on the night of the murder. These panties were never found at the spot she claims the rape took place. Mary, who was unaware of this, later returns to testify that she found the panties in the inn's laundry room, presuming that Quill dropped them down the laundry chute when he returned home. Dancer insistently quizzes her that she is lying, that Quill was her lover and that she is trying to get Manion off the hook out of jealousy of Quill having a relationship with another woman. Mary shocks the court and torpedoes Dancer by stating that Quill was her father.Biegler has played heavily on the issue that he is ""just a humble country lawyer"" facing a ""brilliant prosecutor from the big city of Lansing"", a factor which has played well with the jury. After the closing speeches however, he privately admits that Dancer delivered the ""best summary I've ever heard in a courtroom"". It is to no avail though: Manion is found ""not guilty for reason of insanity"".The next day Biegler and McCarthy go to see the Manions at their trailer park home in order to collect their fee only to find the trailer missing. A note left by Manion tells Biegler that he was ""seized by an irresistible impulse"" the defense used by Biegler during the trial. Evidence left lying around indicates that Manion was actually a heavy drinker who beat Laura before they left. This might indicate that Laura's sexual encounter with Quill was consensual and that Manion killed Quill out of drunken jealousy.Biegler does obtain some ""poetic justice"" by being the attorney appointed to administer Barney Quill's estate."

tt0052602,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","Murder-mystery writer Cornelia van Gorder [Agnes Moorehead] has leased a large country
house called ""The Oaks"". After being in the house for only a few days,
Cornelia's longtime maid, Lizzie Allen [Lenita Lane], informs her that the servants are
upset over rumors they have heard about the murders committed in the house
last winter by the archcriminal who goes by the name of The Bat. They fear
he is back, and they're also concerned about rabid bats that have
supposedly been released by The Bat. That's hysterical nonsense, Cornelia
says as she heads into Zenith to conduct some business at the Zenith City
bank. She has another surprise when vice-president and head cashier of the
bank, Victor Bailey [Mike Steele], mentions that the bank president and owner of The
Oaks, John Fleming [Harvey Stephens], once said that he would never rent the house. Again,
Cornelia is not concerned since she rented the house from his nephew, Mark
Fleming [John Bryant].As Cornelia chats with Victor's wife Dale [Elaine Edwards] and Lieutenant ""Andy""
Anderson [Gavin Gordon],a detective with the Zenith City Police Department and a member
of the board of directors of the Zenith Bank, Victor is informed that the
bank has been looted of over $1,000,000 in bonds and negotiable
securities. Since the only two people with access to the vault are Victor
himself and bank president John Fleming, who is currently away on a
hunting trip in the Northwoods, Victor is arrested and attempts are made
to contact Fleming.Meanwhile, at his lodge in the Northwoods, John Fleming informs his
hunting partner and physician, Doctor Malcolm Wells [Vincent Price], that he has just
embezzled over $1,000,000 from the bank and he needs help in covering it
up. His plan is to murder their hunting guide and disfigure the body
enough that Wells can pass it off as Fleming. After ""Fleming"" is declared
dead and buried, the two of them will split the million. The money is
currently hidden in the Fleming family crypt in Zenith, he explains. Wells
recalls a time, however, when Fleming was very sick and, in fever, talked
about hiding the money in a hidden room in The Oaks. When Fleming
announces that, if Wells doesn't go for the deal, he'll kill Wells and
call it a ""hunting accident,"" Wells turns his shotgun on Fleming.I ain't afraid of ghosts, Lizzie tells Cornelia when they read in the
paper of John Fleming's death. Although the rest of the staff, except for
Warner [John Sutton], the chauffeur, have quit their jobs, Lizzie intends to stay with
""Miss Corny"" under any circumstances. Because there's a storm brewing,
Lizzie and Cornelia check to be sure all the doors and windows are shut.
Lizzie suddenly sees a black-clawed hand reach through the front door,
just about to grab Cornelia's throat. Lizzie's screams scare him off;
Cornelia calls the police. They send someone over to check the grounds,
but no one is found.Cornelia and Lizzie go upstairs and lock themselves in a bedroom.
Meanwhile, The Bat has cut a hole in the front-door window, unlocked the
door, and entered the house. As Cornelia and Lizzie try to sleep, he opens
the transom into their room and releases a bat that flits around for a
moment, lands on Lizzie's arm, and bites her. Concerned that the bat may
be rabid, Cornelia phones Dr Wells. He's in his laboratory conducting an
experiment (on a bat!), but he comes over to look at Lizzie. He dresses
her arm and gives her a sleeping pill. After examining the bat, he
proclaims that it doesn't look sick but that he won't know for sure until
he examines its brain under a microscope. Meanwhile, Lt Andy has taken
advantage of Dr Wells' absence and let himself into the lab where he
snoops around and notices the experimental bat and a figure of a large bat
in one of the windows. Andy then drives over to The Oaks, arriving just as
Wells is leaving. Andy points out the hole in the glass where The Bat
gained entrance and assures Cornelia that an officer will keep watch on
the house for the rest of the night.Several days/weeks? have gone by, and Victor Bailey's trial is coming
up. His secretary, Judy Hollister [Darla Hood], apparently has some information that
will help to acquit him, so people are beginning to suspect that John
Fleming robbed his own bank. Lt Anderson, concerned that his holdings at
the bank will be wiped out if the money isn't found, pays a visit to Mark
Fleming. Mark reveals that he hasn't received a dime of his inheritance
from his uncle because the money is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile,
Cornelia has managed to retain John Fleming's old maid, Jane Patterson [Riza Royce].
When Dr Wells, Dale Bailey, and Judy Hollister drop by for tea, they all
discuss the possibility that it was John Fleming who actually robbed the
bank. Cornelia suggests that Fleming may have hidden the money in The
Oaks, and Dale phones Mark to see whether there are any floorplans of the
house. Mark isn't sure why she would want the floorplan, so Lt Andy
suggests that maybe Uncle John DID steal the money and hid it in the
house. Mark agrees to come over that evening and help look for the plans.Come over Mark does, but he lets himself into the house with his own
key while Cornelia, Dale, and Judy are eating dinner. He moves aside a
grandfather clock and opens a panel to a secret closet. While he looks
over the floorplans, The Bat enters the house and sneaks up behind,
clobbers Mark, and makes off with the floorplans. After dinner, Cornelia
is amazed to hear the grandfather clock striking the hour, when it hasn't
done so in years. They notice that the clock has been moved, then Dale
sees the panel behind it. They open the panel to find Mark Fleming...dead.
Lt Anderson and Dr Wells are notified after the police are called. After
seeing the claw marks on Mark's throat, Anderson proclaims it the work of
The Bat.Later that night, after the police have combed the house for clues
and Mark's body has been taken to the morgue, Lt Anderson remains to make
sure all the windows and doors are locked. As he checks the rooms, he
doesn't notice that Warner is watching him. After the ladies have gone to
sleep, Cornelia and Lizzie in one room, Judy and Dale in another, The Bat
comes in through the unlocked front door. First, he cuts the phone line.
He then goes up to the third floor and into a storage room where he starts
tapping on the walls. The noise wakes up Judy and Dale. Thinking she may
be able to find the hidden money and clear her husband, Dale sneaks up to
the third floor. The Bat locks her in the room and runs downstairs. On the
way down, he runs into Judy and kills her, then he flees out the front
door, after first being struck in the neck by a poker thrown by Cornelia.Shortly thereafter, Lt Andy comes in the front door. He explains that
he was chasing someone on the grounds and asks as to the whereabouts of
Warner the chauffeur. Warner suddenly comes in the front door and explains
that he was following Anderson when he was suddenly hit on the head. It's
then that Anderson remembers seeing a wanted poster with Warner's picture
on it, but Warner says that he was tried and acquitted. He vehemently
denies being The Bat. Suddenly, Dr Wells walks in the front door. He had
an accident about a mile down the road, he says, and walked back to the
house to use the phone. Andy notices blood on Wells' neck. Hmmm, could Dr
Wells be The Bat?Several nights later, after the house had been searched from top to
bottom without finding any money or a hidden room, Cornelia decides to
conduct an investigation of her own. When the detective on duty falls
asleep in his chair, Cornelia goes up to the third floor to look around in
the storage room where The Bat was tapping on the walls. Measuring the
distance between the storage room and the room next to it, Cornelia
notices a loss of about five feet between the two rooms. She pounds on the
walls, then on the panels of a fireplace. Suddenly, one of the panels
opens up, revealing a switch that allows the fireplace to swing open.
Cornelia has found the hidden room. It is empty, except for a safe in the
wall. As she kneels before the safe, the fireplace swings closed, trapping
her in the room.Meanwhile, The Bat has gone to Dr Wells' lab where he hangs a note on
the wall. It says: ""Here lies The Bat -- threatened with exposure he
destroyed himself."" As The Bat turns around, Wells walks into the room with
his gun drawn. The doctor taunts The Bat with the fact that he knows where
the money is hidden and that he's going to shoot The Bat and put his own
sign on his own chest. Just as Wells cocks the gun, The Bat leaps at him.
They struggle, the gun goes off, and it is Wells who is shot.Cornelia's pounding on the walls wakes Lizzie, who notices that
Cornelia's bed is empty. She goes down to the parlor and tries to wake up
Detective Davenport [Robert Williams], only to find him drugged into sleep. Lizzie wakes
the maid who goes to get Warner, only to find him missing. The detective
calls headquarters to alert Lt Anderson only to find that he's been sent
to investigate the death of Dr Wells. The three of them -- Lizzie, Jane,

tt0052618,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'History']","Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is a wealthy merchant living in Judea at the time of Christ. Under the influence of the oppressive Roman Empire, the land seethes with talk of revolt, and Caesar has sent more soldiers to quell the potential uprising. The new Tribune Messala (Stephen Boyd) once lived in Judea as a boy, and longs to rekindle his old friendship with Judah, but when they meet it is obvious that Messala has been changed by the years he has been away, fighting the enemies of the Empire. He is harsh and calculating, driven by ambition, and eager to prove himself to Caesar. Asking Judah for help in rounding up the local dissenters, they argue, and when Judah refuses to betray his own people Messala declares that they must be either friends or enemies, and leaves in anger.A few days later the Romans parade through the city in a show of force and to announce the arrival of the new governor of Judea. As they pass the house of Hur, Judah's sister, Tirzah (Cathy O'Donnell), leans out over the balcony for a better look. She dislodges a few roof tiles which fall near the new governor as he rides by, panicking his horse and throwing him off. Messala seizes an opportunity to frame the Hur family for an attempted assassination. Arresting Judah, his sister and mother, he throws them all into prison. Judah learns that he is to be condemned without trial or hearing, and flies into a desperate rage. Breaking free from his jailers, Judah smashes his way into Messala's chamber, demanding to know why he has done this evil deed. Messala calmly explains that by condemning an old friend without hesitation, he will show the rest of Judea that he is to be feared. ""I asked for your help Judah,"" says Messala, ""and now you've given it to me."" He dismisses Judah to the death of a slave in the galleys, and leaves the mother and sister to rot in prison.Chained to a group of criminals, Judah is marched through the desert. Barely alive, they pass though a village called Nazareth, where a compassionate young man gives him water. Gazing into his eyes, Judah is filled with wonder, and receives the life-giving gift of a simple drink. When an angry Roman guard barks the young man rises and the guard stares into his face, perceiving something there that, perhaps for the first time in his life, forces the Roman to back down. Judah is marched away with the other condemned men, but continues to gaze back at the man who saved his life.Three years pass. Judah rows his life away in the galleys, his latest confinement is aboard a war armada. When the new admiral, Quintas Arrius (Jack Hawkins) comes aboard, he puts all the slaves to a test of endurance, looking for any with enough spirit to defy him. In the galley, he looks over his rowers, telling the guards to change one of them, seeing another who bears the scars of many whippings for insolence and finally Judah. He suddenly lashes Judah, seeing the anger and hate in his eyes but also the control not to attack the man. Later that night, during Judah's resting period, he is ordered to Arrius' quarters, finding him asleep. Arrius suddenly awakes, noting that Judah could have easily killed him. The two talk for a bit, Arrius mentioning that he owns some of the finest gladiator schools in the empire. Judah refuses and returns to the ship's hold.Soon the fleet engages the Macedonian armada in battle and in the mayhem, Arrius' ship is rammed. Shortly before the battle had begun, Arrius had ordered that Judah be unshackled. Arrius himself is cast overboard only to be saved by Judah. The two spend a few days floating at sea on a piece of flotsam, Arrius prevented from killing himself and bound by Judah. Finding his fleet victorious, he returns in triumph to Rome with Judah at his side and after a time adopts him as a son. A rich and influential man once again, Judah's thoughts return to Judea and the vengeance he has sworn on Messala.Along the road to Judea, Judah meets a Arab sheikh and an old wise man named Balthasar, one of those who followed the star of Bethlehem at the time of Christ's birth. Balthasar now seeks Christ grown into a man, and befriends Judah, sensing the goodness of his soul, but also the hatred for an old enemy. Finding that Judah is skilled in chariot racing, Sheikh Ilderim coaches Judah to ride his team of white horses in the upcoming race against Messala and his notorious blacks. Judah accepts and prepares to meet Messala in the arena. The sheikh meets with the lords of Rome, Messala included, and gets them to agree to four to one odds. When he learns of Judah's return, Messala is astonished, but quickly begins to plot again. In the arena, many fortunes can change. Judah meets with Messala, demanding to know where his mother and sister are. Messala claims not to know and Judah harshly tells him to find them and arrange for their release.When Judah arrives at the circus for the race, he spots Messala, who has equipped the wheels of his chariot with spinning, gouging blades. Entering the arena in a grandiose procession, the contestants line up and await the signal from the governor, Pontius Pilate. He drops a white cloth, and the race is on. In this spectacular contest many other teams crash, and Judah and Messala collide time and again, striving for the lead. Messala's spinning blades prove useful against several of his opponents, ripping their chariots and wheels to splinters. When Messala, consumed by his desire to defeat Judah, crashes his chariot into another, yanking off one of his wheels, he is thrown out and dragged behind the stampeding horses of the racer behind him, then thrown out to the rear, landing in a heap in the sand. Judah rides to a glorious victory, and the shattered body of Messala is carried away.Messala is bound to a table by Roman surgeons, who tell him they have to amputate his legs. He refuses to let them start until Judah comes, wanting to face his old friend whole. As his life ebbs, Messala confronts Judah one last time, and tells him that his mother and sister are not dead as was thought, but alive, condemned to lowest cell block of the Roman prison. As they both have endured solitary confinement since their arrest, they both have contracted leprosy. They were freed and sent to a nearby leper colony to live out their final days. Cackling at his final victory over Judah, Messala gasps his last. ""The game goes on Judah!"" he hisses as he dies. A stunned Judah goes forth, his victory hollow, the vengeance he'd sought meaningless.Seeking release from his hatred, Judah walks through the city, encountering Balthasar again, who has now found the living Christ he was seeking. Begging him to come and hear the words of Jesus, he tries to help Judah and ease his pain, but to no avail. Judah cannot live with the thought of his beloved mother and sister suffering in the valley of the lepers, and seeks them out. Tenderly carrying them into the city, he finds it empty, as everyone has gone to the trial of Jesus. Hiding in the shadows, they all witness the suffering of Christ as he is led to his crucifixion. As Jesus passes, Judah recognises him as the young man who'd saved his life with a simple drink of water in the desert. Amazed, he pushes through the guards, and as Jesus falls, Judah carries a gourd of water to him and helps him to drink. Gazing in wonder once more into his eyes, Judah is touched by Christ.At the site of the Crucifixion, Judah and Balthasar weep at the cruelty, and watch as the sky turns dark. Judah's mother and sister take shelter in a nearby cave, and cry out in terror as the Earth trembles, and lightning slashes the sky. A flash of light reveals their leprosy had been healed, a miracle they do not understand, but for which they thank God. Judah returns to his home, finding his family healed and restored to him, and finding also that the sacrifice of Christ has taken the hatred out of his heart and saved his soul."

Brock's spontaneous poetry recital. Despite the poet's open disdain for his simplistic, gullible nature, Walter clings to Maxwell's words and admires his associates, especially sketch artist Carla (Barbour Morris). Unknown to the customers and Yellow Door owner Leonard De Santis, two undercover police officers, Art Lacroix and Lou Raby, take turns staking out the caf√© for possible drug deals.After his shift ends, Walter returns to his small apartment frustrated over his inability to convince the Yellow Door patrons of his artistic potential. When his attempt at sculpting proves futile, Walter lashes out angrily at his landlady's cat and accidentally kills the animal. At first horrified, Walter then covers the cat's body with clay and the next day presents it to Leonard and Carla as a work of art.Amazed by the realistic quality of the ""sculpture,"" Leonard displays the cat in the caf√© and that evening Walter is showered with praise by the Yellow Door regulars, including Maxwell. One customer, Naolia, is so moved by the work that she offers Walter a small vial as a gift. Lou notices the exchange and, following Walter home, asks to see the vial and discovers it contains heroin. Walter is surprised and confused when Lou reveals his identity and demands to know the name of his dealer. Frightened when Lou pulls a gun and places him under arrest, Walter lashes out with a frying pan, splitting Lou's skull. Meanwhile at the caf√©, Leonard is closing up when he accidentally knocks over Walter's cat sculpture and to his horror, discovers fur underneath the clay.The next afternoon when Walter returns to work, Leonard makes sarcastic remarks to him about his artistic talent, but Carla and Maxwell come to his defense. Emboldened, Walter reveals he has a new work to show them, entitled ""Murdered Man,"" which stuns Leonard. On his way to telephone the authorities, however, Leonard is approached by a wealthy art collector who offers five hundred dollars for the cat sculpture. Leonard warily agrees, then later goes with Carla to Walter's apartment to see the new work, which is Lou's body covered with clay. Shocked, Leonard refuses to display the work at the Yellow Door, but when Carla and Walter express puzzlement, Leonard suggests Walter make other pieces in order to put together a show. The distressed caf√© owner encourages Walter to move away from realism and try ""free form"" art, then pays him fifty dollars from the cat sculpture sale.Ecstatic by his newfound success, Walter ceases working at the Yellow Door, and, affecting a beatnik style, becomes one of the caf√©'s customers, where he joins Maxwell's table of artists. One afternoon soon after Walter's initial success, Alice, a part-time model who has been out of town, joins the group but is critical of Walter, whom she knows only as a busboy. Offended by Alice's put-downs, Walter departs, but later follows her home to ask her to pose for him. Alice agrees and goes to Walter's apartment, where he strangles her with a scarf, then makes another ""sculpture"" that he takes to the caf√© the next day.Profoundly affected by Walter's abilities, Maxwell delivers a poetic homage to him that night at the Yellow Door. After a drunken, boisterous night of acclaim, Walter heads for home, but grows frightened at the notion that his fame might be short-lived. Spotting a man cutting wood at a lumber mill, Walter attacks the man and cuts his head off with a large table saw. The next day, Leonard is mortified when Walter brings in his newest work, the bust of a man, and pleads with him to stop sculpting, declaring they have enough pieces for a show. Walter agrees and Leonard sends out invitations for his exhibition.On the night of the show, Walter takes Carla aside and proposes, but Carla insists that while she admires Walter's works, she is not in love with him. Angered and hurt, Walter asks Carla if she will pose for him later and she agrees. At the show, Walter, distressed over Carla's rejection, ignores the renowned art critics admiring his work. A little later, Carla closely examines Alice's sculpture and is terrified when some melting clay reveals a real finger. Carla confronts Walter who quotes Maxwell's poetry and insists he has only immortalized worthless people. Appalled, Carla flees from the caf√© and Walter follows. Meanwhile, Art has also examined some sculptures and, realizing they are dead bodies, pursues Walter. Maxwell and several of his friends also discover the truth behind the sculptures and run after Walter.Haunted by the voices of his victims who assure him that he will be reviled now that he has been discovered, Walter abandons chasing Carla and instead rushes home in fright. When Art, Maxwell, Carla and the others arrive at the apartment, they find that Walter has hanged himself in despair."

business, necessitating that he leave behind his new bride Isabella. In
Drago's absence, Isabella turned to Drago's brother Roberto for
companionship. When Drago returned and discovered their relationship, he
killed his brother. Unable to live with his deed, Drago then killed
himself. But that wasn't the end of Drago Robles.About 20 years later. Water has always been a priceless commodity to
ranchers and farmers in the American West. He who owns the rights to water
is often an important figure in the community. Even more important,
however, is that he share that water with those less fortunate. Much blood
has been spilled over water rights and between those who had water and
those who did not. So it is, between Dr John Carter [John Hoyt] and his neighbor,
Buffer [Bruce Gordon]. Buffer has water, and he is doing everything possible, including
placing a dam on the stream, to drive out Doc Carter so that he can get
his hands on the Carter ranch.But Doc Carter has another problem just now. Young girls all over
town are dying of some mysterious epidemic. The Fuller girl died an hour
ago, but it looks like young Cora [Nancy Kilgas] is going to pull through. Preacher Dan
Young [Eric Fleming] has not stirred from her side all night, and she is doing better
this morning. When offered some coffee and breakfast, Dan realizes how
hungry he is and joins everyone in the kitchen. They were just pouring the
coffee when Cora's scream is heard. By the time Dan gets to her bedside,
Cora is dead. As he kneels down to pray, Dan notices two small, bloody
holes in her neck.Since there is nothing more he can do, Doc Carter rides out to his
ranch where he lives with daughter Dolores [Kathleen Crowley] and son Tim [Jimmy Murphy]. Tim is extremely
upset when Doc arrives. He tells his father how Buffer's men body-beat him
after he tried to bust down the dam, and then Buffer fired four bullets
through his hat. Doc Carter decides to ride back into town to talk with
Sheriff Bill [Edward Binns], who promises to do something about Buffer. By the time the
Doc's buckboard gets home, however, he is dead. After his funeral the next
day, the vampire beds down in Doc's coffin.Grief-stricken over the loss of his father, Tim flies into a rage
when he learns that the fence at the back 40 has been torn down and the
cattle are escaping. Certain that Buffer is behind it, Tim plies himself
with booze and then goes gunning for Buffer. Unfortunately, Buffer
responds to Tim's challenge, and Tim suffers the consequences. Alone now,
Dolores hangs Gun Wanted posters all over town, offering $100 to anyone
who can gun down the murderer. Drake Robey [Michael Pate] answers the call, but not
before he has a talk with Buffer. Buffer identifies himself as the
""murderer"" in the poster, and Robey promises that he will kill Buffer if
he takes the job. Buffer considers this a threat on his life, so one of
his men fires a shot at Robey. He swears he hit Robey dead center, yet
Robey just walks away.Robey takes the job and moves onto the Carter ranch, much to Preacher
Dan's concern. That night, Robey sucks a little blood from Dolores while
she sleeps.Buff is worried. He wants the sheriff to run Robey out of town, but
Dan points out that there's nothing the sheriff can do until Robey breaks
the law. Dan offers Buffer an alternative. He is to put up $5,000 in gold.
Anytime anything goes wrong on Dolores' ranch, even one nail falling from
one fencepost, it's going to cost Buffer $1,000. Buff isn't happy with the
deal, but he goes along with it.The next morning, Dan stops at the Carter ranch to tell Dolores about
the deal with Buffer. He is surprised to find her looking tired,
complaining of the cold and very compliant with his request that she fire
Robey, after she practically threw Dan out last night when he expressed
his mind about her hiring Robey in the first place. Dolores releases Robey
from his contract, and he leaves. Dolores and Dan spend the day going over
Doc's papers, looking for his will. It's growing late, so Dan takes the
safety box home with him to get the papers in order and record them at the
county seat. After Dan leaves, Robey comes to see Dolores. He claims to be losing
the ability to see in sunlight and offers his services as a night
range-rider who can keep an eye on Buffer and his men while the rest of
the ranch-hands are sleeping. Dolores gives him the job.Meanwhile, Dan is looking through the papers in the box when he comes
across a map that shows the Carter ranch as part of Rancho Robles and a
diary written by Don Robles that details the story of his son Drago. It
tells how, shortly after Drago's death, the young girls in town began
dying mysteriously and how Don Robles heard Isabella scream one night and
found his dead son Drago drinking her blood. In an attempt to end the work
of the devil, Don Robles plunged a knife through the heart of his son as
he lay in his coffin. The next day, only the dagger remained.Drago Robles...Drake Robey...Dan is beginning to piece it together.
When he tells Dolores about his discovery, plus the fact that Robey came
to him later that night and stole the map, Dolores doesn't believe him, so
they go to the crypt to look for the body of Drago Robles. His coffin is
empty...except for a silver dagger. When Dan suggests they look in all the
coffins, including those of her father and brother, Dolores goes ballistic
and refuses. Dan leaves to get a court order. Dolores, apparently weak
from loss of blood as well as from throwing a fit over the opening of the
coffins, collapses on the floor of the crypt. Robey pops out of the Doc's
coffin, drinks a little more blood from Dolores, then carries her back
home to her bed.When Dolores awakens, she is disoriented, not knowing how she got
home from the crypt, and she is angry at Robey...until he shows her the
map of Rancho Robles and points out that the stream Buffer has been
damming up is actually on HER property. Robey goes into town to show the
map to Buffer. Buffer doesn't buy it . He draws a gun on Robey, shoots,
and hits him; Robey shoots back, kills Buffer, and walks away.Dolores tells Robey that Dan is going to get a court order to open
the graves. Robey promises to stop him. He goes into town to talk Dan out
of it, but Dan won't be stopped. They challenge each other to a shoot-out.
Since Robey has the advantage with the gun, he gratiously offers Dan the
right to call the turn. Robey begins to walk away. Dan calls the shot.
Robey turns, Dan shoots, Robey shoots, but it's too late. Dan's bullet
hits, and Robey falls to the ground and turns to dust...right in front of
Dolores. Dan walks over to where Robey's clothes remain and fetches his
bullet...the one with the cross on it. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

Suddenly she screams, holding her hands over her bloody eyes and collapses on the floor. Peggy screams and runs out the door for help. The binoculars are shown to have two sharp-pointed awls which were spring-loaded and released into her eyes when she turned the focus knob.At Scotland Yard, Peggy answers questions from Supt. Graham (Geoffrey Keen) and is escorted out the door by Insp. Lodge (John Warwick). Before the door can be closed, in comes Edmund Bancroft (Michael Gough) who is scarcely welcome. Asking to see the binoculars, Bancroft says that the murderer must have seen them in the black museum of the police. He suggests maybe a disgruntled policeman might be the culprit. Graham asks if that will be the subject of his next article in the newspaper. Bancroft reminds them that they do not control the writing of his column, books or newspaper articles which are always accurate. More discussion on who the murderer might be and what weapon might next be used is interrupted by a phone call from Commissioner Wayne (Austin Trevor), who summons the police to a meeting.At the meeting Wayne finds that the police have absolutely no leads on whom the suspect might be. It is confirmed that the weapon used was like one of the ones seen in the police black museum.

After each of the recent murders Bancroft has seen the doctor for treatment: high blood pressure, racing heartbeat, etc. Bancroft refuses to take tranquilizers or slow down until the killer is caught.

Bancroft insists that all information they publish be accurate. Rick asks if he should pick up the mail from readers or the cigars that came in from the tobacconist, but is told that they have more important work to do now. They go downstairs where Rick is told to unlock a door. Inside they step into Bancrofts own black museum, filled with figures of murderers and victims along with various instruments of torture and murder. Bancroft rattles on about how his museum is far superior to that of Scotland Yard and that his weapons will continue to be useful in the future. He also notes that his electronic machine will continue to make the museum alive.Meanwhile Dr. Ballon dictates notes to his nurse, in which he says he believes Bancroft is the victim of some aberration which if untreated will be fatal. He recommends psychiatric treatment.Bancroft is drinking at the apartment of Joan Berkley (June Cunningham), a blonde with whom he has been keeping company.

Graham thanks them all and leaves, telling the constable to remain.A little girl (Ingrid Cardon) tells the constable that she saw the man who entered the apartment earlier with a cane and unlocked the door with a key. Her mother suggests that she made this up or saw it on television. They are all told to go to bed by the constable, and all leave.At the crime scene, Graham and Lodge discuss what they see. Lodge says the head has not been found. The medical examiner (Frank Henderson) suggests maybe it was a guillotine and that she didnt have a chance. Fingerprint expert (Garard Green) tells them it will be hard to get a print off the shattered fragments of glass.A newspaper seller (Thomas Gallagher) hawks the latest edition which reads   KILLER STRIKES AGAIN . One man (Edgar Driver) comments on the story as does another woman.Bancroft is attending a party thrown by his publisher for his new book which has just come out when Graham enters. They immediately begin discussing the case, with Graham saying that Bancroft knows too much about the case. Before leaving, Graham mentions that the culprit has been caught and has confessed to all four crimes. Bancroft seems uninterested in the details but thanks him for the offer.The suspect, Tom Rivers (Howard Greene) demands to see Comm. Wayne and Supt. Graham. He wants to confess to additional murders committed before. He claims to have strangled a waitress in Dover with his bare hands. Bragging about how good he is with his hands, he claims he can build anything. He tells them his next weapon will be a death ray which he is working on, which he will shoot from his eyes. As his stories become wilder, Wayne and Graham leave. Outside the cell, the Sergeant (Geoffrey Denton) comes with a report saying that Rivers was discharged from the military and has been in and out of three mental institutions but is harmless. Graham says these false confessors always memorize the details to seem impressive. He suggests to Wayne that Rivers be detained longer so the press will comment, hoping the killer will be flushed out. Wayne agrees.Reading the paper, Bancroft gloats at the details offered by the press. Rick is surprised when Bancroft tells him they wont get a photo of Rivers for his article. He tells Rick that they will dig out other false confessions from his archives. Bancroft tells Rick he will be gone for a couple of hours and leaves. Rick waits until he is out of sight, looks at his watch, and rushes out.In the park, Rick meets his girlfriend, Angela Banks (Shirley Anne Field as Shirley Ann Field) and promises to tell his employer (Bancroft) about them soon. He confesses that Bancroft has a hold over him to the point where he is unable to refuse anything. She urges him to stand up for himself and tell about their relationship. He promises but swears he has to get back.Entering the antique shop, Bancroft finds Aggie waiting for him. She says he always comes after each murder. She has something for him: large ice tongs. He says he believes he would be interested in them. She tells him the price is ¬£1200, to which he says she is out of her mind. She says he will pay it because she has helped him all this time but that he is the one making all the money. She confesses that she knows that it was he who killed the woman with the binoculars she sold him (because she saw her mark on them in the newspaper photo, which she shows him). He agrees to pay her, but says he doesnt carry that much cash with him. She tells him to bring it tomorrow and turns away. Grabbing the tongs, he seizes her neck with them. She falls bleeding to the floor. He wipes fingerprints off the tongs, the magnifying glass and the doorknob on his way out.The next morning Rick drives Bancroft to Scotland Yard where a newspaper seller announces that a shopkeeper has been murdered. Bancroft tells Rick that the police will be unable to find the murderer without any fingerprints. Rick is told to go back to work and that Bancroft will return by taxi.Bancroft comes in to gloat that the police are not able to do anything and asks to interview Rivers. He tells Graham that he will show in his article that the police are not infallible and will cast a sympathetic view in writing. Graham tells him he is too late; that Rivers was confined to a mental institution. Bancroft leaves, telling Graham  better luck next time in catching the murderer. Working in his museum, Bancroft is operating the machine when the door buzzer sounds. He tells Rick to answer it. Dr. Ballon comes in and confronts Bancroft, saying that Bancroft has perpetrated the murders and needs to be institutionalized. He tells him to accompany him to the police, where he will explain the aberration and have Bancroft put away. Pretending to surrender, Bancroft tells Ballon he will do so now. When Bancroft throws a switch on the machine, Ballon is struck with a death ray, killing him. He tells Rick to help him with the body. A chain is attached, and the body is lowered into a vat of acid for a few moments. When it is removed, only a skeleton remains. Bancroft notices that Rick seems hesitant to do his commands. He tells Rick to hang the skeleton up on the wall and take the night off.Bancroft is appearing at the local bookstore to autograph his book  TERROR IN THE NIGHT . Several people are seen telling him what to write. The bookshop manager (Gerald Case) tells him they sold over 200 copies and it was most successful. Inquiring about the next book, he is told it will be his best so far.Coming home early, Bancroft is horrified to see Rick kissing Angela in the black museum. She tells him they plan to be married soon and that Rick tells her everything about his work. Bancroft tells her next time he will lead her on a tour of his museum. He tells Rick to take her home because they have work to do. She insists that Rick was to take her to the fun fair. He suggests she wait upstairs while he dictates notes to Rick and then they can go. She says she will read his book and goes upstairs.Bancroft turns his anger on Rick and chews him out for bringing Angela into their secret museum. Rick admits he was wrong and wants to know how to appease him. Bancroft prepares a syringe, telling Rick he has waited too long between treatments. Giving Rick the injection, he ascertains that no one else knew about tonight. He tells Rick that one day all this will belong to him; that he will go further than Bancroft did-into the very black soul of man. He reveals that the injections prove that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was not just a story, but a reality he is proving. He tells Rick to take Angela to the fair and do exactly as he is told.Rick and Angela walk around at the fair. When Rick bumps into a passing man, he becomes angry and Angela is surprised. He confesses that he lost his temper. He tells her that from what he has learned he will greatly benefit from Bancroft.They come to where a strength-test barker (Stuart Saunders) is calling for young men to hit the bell at the top of the pole by striking the bottom with a large hammer. The barker taunts Rick about his strength, but Rick insists he will do it. Taking the hammer, he pounds it and rings the bell to the astonishment of the barker and amusement of everyone watching.Angela encourages Rick to stand up to Bancroft and tell him off. She believes he should find another job. Maybe it is working for Bancroft that causes Ricks anger. He doesnt want to talk about it. She says it is a closed subject for tonight. They go into the Tunnel of Love.In the dark, several couples are heard talking. One couple has the woman wanting to smooch, and the other has the man wanting to. When Rick and Angela come out at the end, Ricks face has transformed into that of the killer. Angela screams and Rick stabs her with the dagger. He runs off through the fairway and goes into the Hall of Mirrors. Several people are looking at their distorted images in the mirrors. Rick comes in and looks at his face in one of them. A girl (Carole Ann Ford) notices him looking and asks to borrow his face to scare her boss. When he turns around with the dagger she screams and runs away. He leaves there and goes to the Ferris wheel where he climbs up high. Police and bystanders watch from below as the wheel is stopped.Bancroft brings the draft of his article to Graham and Lodge to inspect. Graham receives a call that the killer is trapped at the fair. They leave and Bancroft insists on coming along, saying he absolutely must have this story.Arriving at the fair, Graham and Lodge are directed to where Rick is atop the ride. They shout for him to come down and they will not shoot. Bancroft comes alongside and looks up at him. Lodge calls for him to come down once more. Rick calls down to Bancroft, telling him that he did everything Bancroft told him to do. Bancroft angrily calls for the police to shoot him down, saying hes a dangerous criminal. At this point Rick jumps and is shot by a policeman. He falls on Bancroft, stabbing him with the dagger. Graham and Lodge crowd around and Graham announces that the monster murderer has been caught."
tt0052905,"['Horror', 'Mystery']","Title and Credits are shown over a painting of Baskerville Hall on a hill top during a storm. A narrator tells us, ""Know then the legend of the Hound of the Baskervilles. Sir Hugo a wild, profane and godless man; An evil man, in truth for there was with him a certain ugly and cruel humor that made his name a byword in the county."" A drunken party is underway and a servant is tortured by Sir Hugo (David Oxley). The servant's daughter is the prize, but she has left the house. Furious, Sir Hugo sets the hounds on her trail, ""The hounds: Let loose the pack!"" The servant girl escapes on the estate, Sir Hugo gives chase and both hear the loud baying of a hound. The girl takes refuge in the old abbey ruins, but Sir Hugo finds her. In a fit of rage, he stabs her with a dagger. He hears the hound. It attacks and kills him.""And so, the curse of Sir Hugo came upon the Baskervilles in the shape of a hound from Hell, forever to bring misfortune to the Baskerville family. Therefore, take heed and beware the moor in those dark hours when evil is exalted else you will surely meet the hound of Hell, the hound of the Baskervilles."" Dr. Mortimer (Francis De Wolff) reads this last passage to Sherlock Holmes (Peter Cushing) at his Baker street residence. Holmes is unimpressed and Dr. Mortimer is perturbed. Holmes asks the real reason for his visit. ""The body of Sir Charles Baskerville discovered on Dartmoor early today,"" Dr. Mortimer reads from a local newspaper. Sir Charles was found by a servant, Barrymore, near the abbey ruins up on a hill not far from Baskerville Hall. The coroner's inquest ruled it heart failure. Dr. Mortimer's desire is to have Holmes investigate the matter because he thinks Sir Henry is in danger. Holmes agrees to see Sir Henry at his hotel the next day. Dr. Watson (Andre Morell) sees Dr. Mortimer out.Sir Henry Baskerville (Christopher Lee) is dressing in his hotel room. Holmes and Watson arrive, but Sir Henry mistakes them for hotel employees that have come to investigate a missing boot. Dr. Mortimer arrives amid the confusion and makes introductions. Sir Henry makes it clear he intends to occupy Baskerville Hall. Dr. Mortimer reluctantly tells Holmes the estate is worth about one million pounds. The will details bequests, including one thousand pounds for the Barrymores, and Dr. Mortimer is to receive forty thousand pounds. Holmes tells Sir Henry that, ""I must impress upon you that I believe your life to be in considerable danger."" Holmes also tells him that he is unable to leave London at the moment, but he will be sending Dr. Watson along to Dartmoor. Before anyone leaves, the first attempt on Sir Henry happens. A poisonous tarantula is hidden in a boot and crawls up near Sir Henry's head, but Holmes dispatches it.Sir Henry, Watson and Dr. Mortimer arrive in Dartmoor. Dr. Mortimer exits the cart for a short walk home. Before he walks away Perkins, the cart driver (Sam Kydd) suggests that Dr. Mortimer not walk alone. He tells him there has been a prison escape and a man named Selden, sentenced to life imprisonment is out on the moors. Sir Henry and Watson proceed to Baskerville Hall while Dr. Mortimer walks home. They are met at the Hall by Barrymore (John Le Mesurier). He gives the new master a tour of the house, and shows him a portrait of Sir Hugo. He tells him of the legend. Sir Henry notices a missing portrait, another of Sir Hugo. He is told it disappeared a few months ago. Watson is at the table finishing his meal. Sir Henry offers a toast, but Mrs. Barrymore (Helen Goss), visibly upset drops her glass then excuses herself. Dr. Watson asks Barrymore about the death of Sir Charles, as he found the body. Dr. Watson asks Barrymore if he believes in the legend of the hound. Barrymore tells Dr. Watson that he has heard the terrible howl.Dr. Watson is awakened in the night to the sound of a woman moaning. He investigates but finds nothing. The next morning the local Vicar, Bishop Frankland (Miles Malleson) stops to ask Sir Henry for a donation to the church. He is invited in for a glass of sherry. Sir Henry asks Mrs. Barrymore to donate an old suit to the jumble sale. Dr. Watson stops at the Grimpen Post Office to get a telegram from Holmes. It reminds Watson, ""Under no circumstances allow Sir Henry to venture on the moor alone at night."" Dr. Watson walks back to Baskerville Hall through the moor. He encounters Stapleton (Ewen Solon) who warns the doctor he was about to step into a trap. Stapleton also warns Watson to stick to the trail, lest he fall into the Grimpen Mire. Along the walk he encounters Cecile Stapleton (Maria Landi). Watson asks her if he is on the right path to Baskerville Hall. She bolts without answering, and Watson follows her but he falls into the mire. Stapleton rescues him, Cecile returns and helps. The Stapletons, father and daughter, return Dr. Watson to Baskerville Hall. Watson and Stapleton go into the house, and Cecile remains in the cart outside. They don't know Sir Henry is out riding his horse. Sir Henry arrives and talks to Cecile. She is very rude to Sir Henry. She runs away and when confronted, she kisses Sir Henry.That evening after everyone else has gone to bed, Sir Henry is joined by Dr. Watson. They see a light under the door of an unoccupied room. A candle burns near a window. Sir Henry notices a light out on the moor--a signal. Dr. Watson and Sir Henry investigate outside and find the source of the light. They find Selden (Michael Mulcaster), the escaped convict. They give chase and hear the hound. Sir Henry suffers a mild heart attack. Dr. Watson helps him back to the hall. Dr. Mortimer examines Sir Henry and orders bed rest. Dr. Watson wants Mortimer to stay and watch Sir Henry while he returns to the moor. Watson goes to the abbey ruins and encounters Holmes asking, ""Why have you left Sir Henry alone?"" Holmes tells Watson he has been in Devon for the whole time gathering information from Selden. ""Selden told me all he had seen since hes been hiding."" They hear the hound in the distance and run to investigate. Holmes notices Dr. Mortimer left Baskerville Hall. They hear a man scream and rush to investigate. They spot a man they believe to be Sir Henry dead. Holmes and Watson return to Baskerville Hall to get help to move the body. They see a light under the door of the signal room. Inside the room is Sir Henry reading a book. Sir Henry asks, ""Who was it Holmes? Who was the poor devil that died instead of me?"" Holmes deduces it was Selden, ""Selden had on the suit you were wearing when we met in London.""The next morning, Holmes and Watson return to the site of the death of Selden. They go to the abbey ruins and there they find blood on a stone and a dagger. Barrymore finds Selden's body, which had been moved from the night before. His body has been mutilated. ""Some revolting sacrificial rite has been performed,"" Holmes notes. At the Hall, Holmes confronts Mrs. Barrymore and extracts the confession she was aiding her brother, Selden. She gave him food and Sir Henry's clothes and used the candle as a signal.Holmes pays a visit on the Bishop to inquire about a missing spider. Holmes knows the Bishop is regarded as the highest living authority on the study of rare spiders. He asks about the genus Theraphosa--tarantula. Bishop Frankland finally admits he is missing a tarantula and volunteers his visitor list, which included Dr. Mortimer and the Stapletons.Sir Henry stops at the Stapleton cottage. He lets himself in when no one answers his knock. Cecile appears and asks, ""Why did you come here?"" Stapleton is out and Cecile tells Sir Henry he is invited for dinner. She tells Sir Henry she is Spanish and her mother is dead. Her father returned to farm, but the property is no good. Sir Henry is in love with Cecile. Stapleton walks in and sees his daughter and Sir Henry being intimate. They sit and have a drink.Holmes and Watson meet with and confront Dr. Mortimer. They suspect he may have had a hand in the strange circumstances surrounding the death of Sir Charles and the attempts on Sir Henry. They ask about an old tin mine on the property. Mortimer tells Holmes that Stapleton may be more help as it is under his land. Holmes insists in seeing the mine, and insists that Dr. Mortimer accompany him. Holmes shows Mortimer the dagger that was used on Selden and the same as Sir Hugo used to kill the servant girl centuries earlier.Stapleton, Dr. Mortimer, and Holmes explore the old tin mine. Watson stays above. It is dank and water seeps through from the mire above. Holmes is looking for bones. While Stapleton and Mortimer chock the wheels of an old mining cart, Holmes explores deeper. He tells the two men, ""We won't need to go any further, I've found what I came down for."" They hear the hound howling. The cart runs down the rails, hits a support beam and causes a cave in, trapping Holmes. They dig for a while, but after two hours they stop. As it turns out, Holmes is waiting in the cart. He hurt his leg. Back at Baskerville Hall, Sir Henry invites Holmes and Watson to join him for dinner at the Stapletons. Holmes is very rude to Sir Henry. This is his plan--he wants Sir Henry to leave without them. The dagger is missing and Holmes has learned that Sir Hugo's hands were webbed, like Stapleton's hands. It turns out Stapleton is next in line for the Baskerville fortune. Holmes and Watson head for the abbey ruins where Sir Henry and Cecile have gone. She is leading Sir Henry to her father, the hound, and certain death. Fortunately Holmes and Watson hear Cecile's plan as she tells Sir Henry he will die. The hound appears and leaps on Sir Henry. It begins to maul him. Stapleton attacks Watson as he tries to shoot the hound. They scuffle briefly but Watson manages to shoot Stapleton. Holmes shoots the hound which turns on Stapleton. Cecile retrieves the dagger and tries to finish Sir Henry off, but Holmes intervenes. Cecile escapes. Holmes and Watson help Sir Henry to his feet and show him the dead dog. The dog was kept in the mine, starved for weeks, given the scent and turned loose. His missing boot was the scent. Cecile still running slips into the mire and is pulled under.Back in London Holmes and Watson admire a gift sent by Sir Henry. It is the missing portrait of Sir Hugo, showing his deformed hand, as a souvenir Holmes can add to his collection. Sir Henry also included a check for a very generous amount. Watson asks Holmes about what clue was the key. Holmes quips that, ""the missing boot put me on the scent."" We close with Holmes and Watson having tea."
tt0052939,"['Drama', 'Romance', 'Thriller']","The opening credits follow a car as it heads down the road to the accompaniment of a jazz quintet. When the film begins, it begins at the end, with a coffin being taken down from the countryside to the village. A constable tells the camera that there are two men and one woman involved in an accidental shooting. Suddenly the three of them appear onscreen one at a time, Bj√∏rn (Rolf S√∏der) and Knut (Tor Stokke) with their rifles, and Guri (Bente B√∏rsum) taking a snapshot of them posing, as the narrator takes us back to the beginning. He tells the audience that Guri is the lover of Knut but she emphatically tells the camera its not true, followed by saying shes lying. As they embark on their hunt, the narrator turns it over to Bj√∏rn, who talks about the dogs, and when they flush out some birds and one is killed, Guri says she doesnt like it. Then Knut addresses the camera and tells the audience that the trip is important for him and begins to argue, in the voiceover, with Bj√∏rn. Knut gets the next bird, and in his mind its symbolic of his attempt to get Guri. Bj√∏rn had his chance, he figures, but Bj√∏rn still thinks Guri hasnt made up her mind yet between the two of them.When they sit down to rest the narrator says that the audience doesnt know enough about the three of them and so she thinks back to the trip out in the car when Knut accidentally killed a sheep on the road. Bj√∏rn drinks the animals blood and Guri throws up out the window. The narrator asks him why, but Bj√∏rn tells him to shut up. Instead of a hunting ground, Bj√∏rn now sees the wilderness as a battleground where two men will fight over the woman. A duel. Back on the hunt the two men shoot at a bird simultaneously and argue about who made the kill, which Bj√∏rn takes as a provocation on the others part. Then Guri thinks back to a conversation between the two she overheard the night before where Bj√∏rn threatened to kill Knut over her. That night, when Knut doesnt come back, she thinks Bj√∏rn may have actually killed him. But he turns up eventually. When Guri tries to understand whats going on, she thinks back to her marriage with Bj√∏rn. The two men were old friends and at their engagement party Bj√∏rn didnt want to dance and so she danced with Knut. Thats when she believes the struggle between the two friends began.One day, after a dinner party the couple throws for Knut, he calls and wants to see Guri alone. He confesses his love for her, and when she tells her husband that night he says hes known for years but hes not worried about it. Bj√∏rn has invited Knut on a hunting trip and Guri doesnt want to go along, for obvious reasons. She sees Knut the next day to ask him not to go, but of course he refuses. And later when hes out with Bj√∏rn he sees her keys left in the lock of the car and takes them. But when he gives them back to Bj√∏rn, the husband mistakenly believes there is something more going on with Knut than there actually is and confronts Guri the next morning. She is hurt by the accusation but has absolutely no idea how he got the keys. In her depression, a dissolve suddenly goes back to the cabin. Bj√∏rn and Knut are rolling dice to see who will go to get supplies at the village and Bj√∏rn loses. He doesnt want to leave his wife alone with Knut and so he had planned on her coming with him, but she refused. He doesnt know why she wont go, but he heads out early the next morning so he can get back before dark.Bj√∏rn hikes back to the car with one of his dogs and all he can think about is the two of them together. Back at the cabin Knut teases Guri for not going along like a good wife should, implying that shes not a good wife because shed rather be with him. She doesnt want to go out hunting with him, and asks him how they can protect themselves from thoughts they shouldnt be having. He says they dont need to, and she eventually goes with him. Walking together, Knut believes he has won, but believes he has to be patient in order not to ruin it. When they stop to rest she asks him pointedly why he believes he has the right to act this way toward her. He had been thinking the same thing, but couldnt explain it to her so, overwhelmed with desire, he throws himself upon her and kisses her. Then she pushed him off and runs away. He follows, but she wasnt heading back to the cabin. When he realizes they are back on the hunt as if nothing had happened, he still doesnt know the answer to her question, and they talk to themselves in voice-over. He wonders if shes thinking of Bjorn, but shes not.As two partridges are flushed, she follows them with her gun and suddenly she stops, aiming at Knuts back. He turns, and more than anything she wants to fire, but cant pull the trigger. Instead of being afraid he takes it as a sign and kisses her again. This time she lets him. But then suddenly the shepherd appears. Meanwhile Bj√∏rn is racing back as fast as he can but is slowed by a milk truck making deliveries. Knut, on their way back to the cabin, remembers back to the first time he met Guri, alone on a tennis court in Oslo. She wasnt sure she should, but decided to play a little with him. Knut clearly had his hopes up, but when Bj√∏rn arrived he made it obvious to Knut that she was his. It turns out, though, that Bj√∏rn didnt know her either. He found out later that Bj√∏rn had tricked him, but from that day forward he had never stopped thinking about her, and instead just pretended to be her friend. He tried going abroad for a couple of years, but he missed Oslo, and her, and eventually returned. Back at the cabin, as darkness falls, Guri is anxious for Bj√∏rn to arrive. But the car has broken down and Bj√∏rn asks the shepherd to get it fixed while he begins the long walk back to the cabin, not figuring to arrive before dawn. Knut and Guri dance together to the radio after dinner, but she is clearly uncomfortable being alone with him. He, on the other hand, is ecstatic that she is his for the moment, and yet wants desperately to know how she feels. Bj√∏rn, walking back, feels he has lost his wife, doubting himself all the way. As Knut and Guri prepare to sleep, he advances on her, but she resists. When Bj√∏rn arrives at the cabin he finds Knut in their bed and his wife sleeping alone on the floor. She has left dinner for him on the stove. Then he kicks Knut out and takes her to bed with him, but he has imagined the worst. When Bj√∏rn wakes up the next morning and shes not in bed, he immediately wonders if shes with Knut. But hes alone in his sleeping bag, and so Bj√∏rn thinks to himself that he doesnt have to kill him yet. She is out by herself at the waters edge, but realizes that her actions when she returns have the possibility of determining life and death. When she returns she takes a picture of the two. The kiss of Knut still burns in her while Bj√∏rns jealousy is tearing her apart. They immediately return to hunting that morning without talking about anything. Guri compares the tension to an abscess that needs to be lanced. The dogs flush out some more birds, but as the three of them are tracking them with their guns she accidentally shoots Bj√∏rn. Before he dies, however, he asks her if it really was an accident. Knut hefts the body on his shoulders and begins carrying him back to the cabin while Guri stumbles along behind him in a daze. Knut yells at her to see if hes still alive, to see if his body is cold yet, but she can barely move. The scene then shifts to a courtroom. With no incriminating evidence, the judge declares a dismissal. Knut leaves, and now Guri is alone, without either of them, alone with her secret that she is pregnant. As she turns and walks away from the camera the narrator says this is not a good way to end the story. Then a woman runs into the frame asking who the father is, and a group of people join her and accost Guri, demanding to know. The woman says the audience has a right to know. When Guri runs out into the street to escape them, a car comes rushing at her with its horn blaring and the scene dissolves into Guris bedroom, with Knut outside honking the horn of their car and yelling that theyre leaving in ten minutes. Hes dangling the keys to her car that she misplaced. And when she turns around to look back at the bed and sees Bj√∏rn she realizes that the hunting trip has all been a dream . . . or a nightmare."
tt0052948,"['Adventure', 'Family', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'SciFi']","Scotland, 1880: Oliver Lindenbrook (James Mason), a distinguished professor at the University of Edinburgh, has just been granted knighthood for service to the Crown in the field of geology. When he arrives at his lecture hall on the day of the announcement, he is surprised by a gathering of staff and students. They present him with an elaborate decorative inkwell and the Dean declares a holiday in celebration of the occasion. As the others leave, one student, Alec McKuen (Pat Boone), remains behind. He offers Lindenbrook an extra token, a rock he acquired in a curiosity shop in Glasgow: a lump of lava, strangely heavy, although lava is usually very light. Pleased with the offering, Lindenbrook invites him to dinner at his home that evening. As Alec leaves, Lindenbrook turns his attention back to the unusual rock.Alec arrives at Lindenbrook's house that evening to find that the professor never came home, and his niece, Jenny (Diane Baker), is both angry and worried. Alec and Jenny go to his laboratory at the University, and find him and his assistant, Paisley (Ben Wright), feverishly experimenting on that same piece of lava. Lindenbrook shows Alec that he has chipped away a fragment of the lava and uncovered a manmade object inside, marked with three grooves or notches. He is about to melt off the rest of the lava to discover what it might be. Tired and distracted, Paisley pours in too much fuel at that moment, and the stove explodes. In the aftermath, Lindenbrook finds that the lava has been blasted free of the object, and it is revealed to be a surveyor's plumb bob with a few Nordic words painfully scratched on it. Lindenbrook and Alec recognize the signature with wonder: Arne Saknussem, a brilliant but eccentric Icelandic scientist, who had disappeared many years earlier while exploring the volcanoes of his homeland.Two weeks later, the Dean and the Rector of the University (Alan Napier and Alan Caillou) call at Lindenbrook's home to ask why he's neglecting his teaching duties. He tells them the story of the plumb bob, and shows it to them along with the translation he had made of its message: ""I am dying but my life's work must not be lost. Whoever descends into the crater of Sneffels Yokul can reach the center of the earth. At sunrise on the last day of May, the Mountain Scartaris will point the path."" Lindenbrook explains that Sneffels Yokul is an extinct volcano in Iceland, and Scartaris a nearby mountain peak. He has written a paper, and sent it to the eminent Professor Goteborg of Sweden for review, and plans to mount an expedition to Iceland as soon as Goteborg confirms its feasibility.But Goteborg's reply is overdue, although Lindenbrook has written twice. Instead, a letter arrives from the University of Sweden saying that Goteborg has vanished without a word of explanation. Lindenbrook immediately suspects that Goteborg intends to mount an expedition of his own, and claim credit for the discovery. He decides to leave for Iceland at once, and Alec decides to accompany him.In Iceland, a visit to Sneffels Yokul reveals that Goteborg has indeed been surveying there. Lindenbrook sends Alec back to town to acquire the equipment and supplies they will need while he makes his own observations of the crater. Goteborg (Ivan Triesault) has been watching their arrival, and, desperate to delay them, arranges for them to be abducted and imprisoned in a remote eider down storage shed. Fortunately, they are quickly discovered there by a tall, young Icelandic man, Hans Belker (Peter Ronson), and his pet duck, Gertrude. He releases them and escorts them back to Reykjavik.It turns out that they are staying at the same hotel as Goteborg. They ask for him at the desk, but the hotel proprietress (Edith Evanson) is uneasy and evasive, saying at first that he is not in, then saying he cannot be disturbed. Lindenbrook hands his business card to her, asking her to put it in Goteborg's mailbox, and they watch as she does so, learning his room number. They knock and shout at Goteborg's door, but he doesn't answer. Hans picks the lock, and they go inside to wait for his return. As they look enviously over the supplies and equipment he has stockpiled there, they also find his lifeless body, neatly laid out, covered by a blanket. And they discover evidence that his death was not a natural one...a few grains of potassium cyanide linger on his beard.Meanwhile, Goteborg's wife, Karla (Arlene Dahl), has arrived from Sweden. When she asks for her husband at the desk, the proprietress shows her into her office, and breaks the news to her of her husband's death. Lindenbrook, coming downstairs to talk to the proprietress, overhears the conversation, and steps in to inform them both that Professor Goteborg was murdered. The proprietress discloses that the last person to see Goteborg alive was Count Saknussem (Thayer David), a descendant of Arne Saknussem, and a well-known scientist in his own right. She goes off to inform the police.Lindenbrook asks Madame Goteborg to sell him the professor's equipment. She is too distraught to discuss the matter, and tries to put him off. A desperate Lindenbrook then demands that she sell him the equipment, blurting out that he has a right to it as her husband had been trying to cheat him of credit for his discovery. Outraged, she flatly refuses. But later, reading her husband's diary, she learns that Lindenbrook told the truth. She agrees to sell him the equipment on condition that he allows her to join the expedition. He is reluctant, but must consent: Goteborg had bought up all the equipment in town, no other is available. And since Hans, who speaks no English, is also going, and Madame Goteborg speaks Icelandic, she will be useful in helping them all to communicate.At the last moment, Hans decides on his own to bring along his duck, Gertrude.Dawn finds them on the rim of the volcanic crater, waiting for Saknussem's sign. A single ray of light from the rising sun peeks through the crags of Scartaris, marking their gateway. The Lindenbrook Expedition sets off...unaware that Count Saknussem (Thayer David) and his servant have been watching--and will follow.They soon discover that Arne Saknussem marked his pathway at regular intervals with his three-notches signature, and they need only look for these to keep on the right path. One night, the Count and his servant creep past them as they sleep. At the next set of notches, the Count chisels new marks in the rock that point a different direction, while his servant conceals the original marks. The Lindenbrook party is led astray by the false marks and Alec is nearly killed in a fall. Backtracking, they discover where and why they went wrong. Now they know they are in a race with a dangerous enemy.They are separated at one of their campsites, a spectacular crystalline rock formation and mineral spring. At one point, off by himself, Alec drops his lantern through a hole in the rock. He climbs in to retrieve it, and when he starts back he misses the correct corridor. Meanwhile, Lindenbrook chisels off a sample of the unique rock formation, and as he does so, the whole wall collapses, and the chamber floods with water. Lindenbrook, Madam Goteborg, and Hans must scramble to escape. They don't notice Alec is not with them until they are out of the flooded chamber.Alec and the rest of the party wander separately for days, looking for each other. Alec eventually stumbles upon Count Saknussem, whose servant has died of ""too much heat, too much burden and too much fear,"" leaving the Count stranded. The Count tries to force Alec to pick up the servant's burden. Alec refuses, and begins to walk away. Count Saknussem shoots him in the arm with his revolver. The noise brings Lindenbrook, Hans and Madam Goteborg on the run, but the happy reunion is short-lived, with the Count holding a gun on them all. He tells the others to go back, leaving Hans behind to serve him. Lindenbrook pretends to agree, then tricks and disarms him. They debate on what to do with him: They all agree he is guilty of murder and mayhem, but they are all too civilized to do away with him or leave him behind to die. They reluctantly allow him to join their group.They continue on their journey for many weeks, growing ragged and weary, running short of supplies. One day Alec finds a forest of mushrooms. Some are as large as trees, but there are also smaller, edible mushrooms, and all are relieved and grateful for the dietary change. While the others rest, Count Saknussem goes exploring beyond the forest. He comes back long enough to order Hans to fell some of the giant mushrooms and build a raft, then leaves again. Lindenbrook follows him, and finds that Saknussem has discovered a vast underground ocean. To continue their journey, they must cross this sea--hence, the raft. When they try to launch it, however, they are attacked by giant fin-backed lizards. Hans manages to kill one of them with a spear. The others immediately turn on it to devour it, and while they are feeding, the party escapes onto the subterranean sea.After days on the water, they suddenly encounter a magnetic force so powerful it rips away everything made of metal...even Madam Goteborg's wedding ring and Hans's gold tooth! They have reached the center of the earth! But they're caught up in a maelstrom, and it wrecks their frail craft. They make it to the beach exhausted, no food or equipment, with only the rags on their backs, and collapse, exhausted. They decide to sleep before they try to plan their next move. Gertrude wriggles free of Hans's arms and strolls down the beach. The Count, also wakeful, sees her and begins to follow. When Hans wakes, he follows Gertrude's tracks, calling for her. He finds a lone white feather at the mouth of a cave...he finds more inside, stained with blood. Furious, he begins to climb toward the Count, who is using a rock to scratch something on a rock wall. He tries to strangle the Count, but Lindenbrook and Alec drag him away. Angry and frightened, the Count rages at them all, accusing them of being ungrateful fools. As he rants, he steps backward and stumbles into the wall on which he was pounding, earlier. It collapses on top of him, killing him.The others move up to the place where he fell, and see in the chamber beyond the ruins of an ancient city, which Lindenbrook speculates may have been part of the Lost City of Atlantis. Exploring, they find the skeleton of Arne Saknussem...with a broken leg to explain why he never returned. His only remaining possession is a knapsack full of gunpowder. Madam Goteborg notes that his hand seems to be pointing, and they turn to see the opening of a volcanic shaft, with a tremendous updraft, indicating it could be a direct path to the earth's surface. But it is blocked by a massive boulder. Lindenbrook suggests they use the gunpowder in Arne Saknussem's knapsack to dislodge it. They forage through the city, and find flint and iron with which to make fire, and a few crude tools. They set their charge and twist together a fuse. Lindenbrook lights it, and they take shelter in a bowl-shaped altar stone. The force of the blast does dislodge the boulder, but also triggers a volcanic eruption. The altar stone (fortunately made from an ancient form of asbestos) is borne up by the hot lava into the shaft, and propelled at a terrific speed to the surface. They are ejected from a dead volcano in the Lipari Islands, now activated by the blast, into the Mediterranean Sea, where all but Alec are rescued by fishermen. Alec, it develops, was thrown early from the altar stone, and is rescued (trouser-less!) from a tree by a group of nuns.Back in Edinburgh, the expedition is greeted enthusiastically by a crowd of students at the University. Lindenbrook thanks them, but says that all his notes and samples were lost and he would never embarrass the University by claiming credit for an accomplishment he can't prove.Alec is there, in a wheelchair with a cast on his leg, and Jenny by his side. It seems that he was in such a hurry to leave the church after their wedding that he fell and broke his leg. Nevertheless, they are clearly happy. Hans is also there, but leaving shortly for Iceland. Lindenbrook offers his heartfelt thanks, and Hans replies in a few laboriously-learned English words that if the professor ever decides to go down there again, Hans will go, too. They shake hands and say goodbye. Madam Goteborg tells Lindenbrook she is leaving, as well, to return to Sweden. Lindenbrook protests, saying she must stay and help him with his memoirs. As they argue about the terms on which she will stay, they both finally realize that they care for each other, and want to be together. They kiss, and the crowd cheers."

tt0052993,"['Romance', 'Western']","An attractive American Indian woman and her young son are in a wagon, passing through a secluded, wooded area. They nervously pass by two dismounted, shiftless cowboys who are killing time by guzzling whiskey. The woman glances apprehensively over her shoulder as the two men mount up and follow along. As the men draw even with the buggy, they begin harassing the woman, asking her to stop and have a drink with them. She picks up a buggy whip and lashes one of the cowboys, Rick Belden (Earl Holliman), across the face, then whips her horse into a dead run. With the drunken cowboys in hot pursuit, the speeding wagon careens over onto its side and throws the woman and boy out. The woman frantically orders the boy to flee as the leering cowboys strip off her clothes and assault her. The boy takes one of the cowboys' horses and escapes. He gallops into the nearby town where his dad, Marshal Matt Morgan (Kirk Douglas) is busy entertaining some local urchins with tall tales from the ""old days."" Morgan rushes out into the street to meet the distraught boy, who can't verbalize what just took place. Morgan mounts up on the horse with his son and races back in the direction of the overturned wagon. Morgan discovers the nude body of his wife, who has been raped and murdered. He tearfully recovers her body and returns to the waiting horse, when he notices that the animal carries a beautiful silver-trimmed saddle emblazoned with the initials ""CB."" Morgan recognizes the initials.Later that same day, Rick Belden is drinking whiskey at a saloon in the town of Gun Hill. One of the saloon girls notices the deep cut on his face from the whiplash he received earlier. She teases him, saying that it does her good to see him getting scratched for a change. Belden slaps her to the floor and drunkenly confronts the startled saloon patrons who object to his behavior. Before anything worse can take place, a ranch hand named Beero (Brad Dexter) enters the saloon and tells young Belden that his father wants to see him immediately. It seems that the hotheaded Rick took something of his father's without permission. The men return to the Belden ranch where Rick is confronted about the missing saddle by his father, Craig Belden (Anthony Quinn). Rick lies and claims that their horses were stolen along with the valuable saddle. When his father notices the deep laceration on his son's face, he beams proudly and makes light of it. Beero sarcastically remarks that Rick would do better to fight with men. An offended Craig Belden goads his weakling son into fighting Beero and defending the Belden family name. Rick tries to beg off, but Craig insists. Beero easily fends off the hapless Rick, knocking him to the floor twice before Craig stops the fight. Craig Belden is revealed to be a tough, self-made and ruthless patriarch whose blind tolerance of his son's outrageous behavior has already ruined the boy.Having identified the fancy saddle, Marshal Morgan explains to his deceased wife's Indian father that he and Craig Belden are old friends. The old man wants revenge, and Morgan vows to get it. He then boards the train to Gun Hill to return the saddle and ask Belden which of his men were involved in his wife's murder. On the train, he meets a woman named Linda (Carolyn Jones). She recognizes the saddle and warns him about Craig Belden and his powerful influence in Gun Hill. When the train arrives, Beero is waiting to take Linda straight to Belden's ranch. She declines and checks into a hotel instead. When Morgan steps off the train with the saddle, Beero confronts him. Morgan tells him to let Belden know he is coming. Morgan hires a rig and starts out for the Belden ranch. Beero has already ridden ahead and warned Belden that someone is on the way with his saddle. An enraged Belden arrives at the ranch house and is shocked to encounter his old friend Matt Morgan. They drink to old times and Belden discloses that although he has become prosperous, he lost his wife nine years ago. Now it is just him and his son. Morgan inquires how the saddle had gotten lost and Belden tells him that his son Rick and a friend named Lee Smithers (Brian Hutton) had passed through Pawley (Marshal Morgan's town) a few days ago. He explains that they were drinking in a saloon on Sunday when someone stole their horses and saddles. Morgan tells him that his wife was murdered that same day, and that one of the murderers was using Belden's silver saddle. Belden offers to help in any way he can and asks Morgan how we will be able to identify the killers. Morgan explains that his nine-year-old son had been present that day, and that he had witnessed his mother lashing one of the men's cheek open to the bone. A sudden look of recognition crosses Belden's face, and Morgan sees it. He accuses Belden's son of the crime, explaining that neither of the town's saloons are open on Sunday, making Rick Belden a liar. Belden nervously tries to deny his son's involvement and warns Morgan to leave Rick alone and get out of town at once. Morgan replies that he will be on the last train out of Gun Hill at 9 PM, but that Rick and his friend will be going with him to stand trial.Back in town, Morgan gets no cooperation from the citizens of Gun Hill. They are terrified of Craig Belden, who owns half the town. The corrupt sheriff makes it clear that he won't help.Belden confronts his son and Lee, telling them just who it was that they killed. They claim that the death of Morgan's wife was an accident, and then dismiss her as ""just an Indian squaw."" Belden angrily banishes Lee from his ranch and warns Rick that Matt Morgan is no one to trifle with. Rick protests that he isn't afraid and rashly insists on going into town. Craig Belden insists that he take Beero and another man along.Morgan searches the town for Rick, but runs into immediate resistance. One of three men seated in front of a saloon remarks that he wouldn't arrest any man for killing an Indian; they would pay him a bounty instead. Morgan knocks him out with a forearm to the jaw. The other two men decline to test him. In the saloon, a friendly bartender warns him to leave Rick alone. The only person willing to help Morgan is former saloon girl (and Craig Belden's erstwhile mistress) Linda. She advises Morgan to look for Rick in the saloon across the street. Morgan stealthily climbs up the side of the building and sneaks in the window of an upstairs bedroom, where a startled saloon girl is sleeping. Simultaneously, Rick interrupts his card game and heads upstairs to pay a visit to the girl. Morgan gets the jump on him and knocks him out cold with the butt of his gun. He heaves Rick across his shoulder and starts down the stairs, gun drawn. Two saloon employees go for their shotguns before Morgan shoots them down. He orders Rick's cardplaying friends into a store room, but one of them ducks behind a table to fight back. Morgan fires through the table and wounds him, then locks everyone up in the store room. Out on the street, he runs into the corrupt sheriff, who doesn't challenge him but tells him he will never get away with it. Morgan goes into a hotel and forcibly coerces the reluctant manager into giving him a room. He handcuffs Rick to the bed and settles in to wait on the 9 o'clock train.Belden soon arrives with twenty men and tries to reason with Morgan. When it becomes obvious that Morgan is serious about putting Rick on the train, Belden orders his men to open fire through the windows of Morgan's hotel room. Shots rain in from the surrounding rooftops, but Morgan returns fire and kills two of Belden's men. He also shoves the bed holding Rick in front of one window, limiting Belden's options. Belden is afraid to rush the room and possibly wound his son.Belden enters the saloon and confronts Linda about not returning to his ranch. It is revealed that she has been away at a hospital recovering from a beating administered by Craig Belden. She complains that Rick constantly makes up lies about her, fueling Craig's jealousy. She asks Belden if he is finally willing to marry her, but he admits that Rick is the obstacle. She knows that Belden will always choose his son over her. On a saloon bet, Linda walks over to her hotel and goes up to the room where Morgan is holding Rick. He admits her to the room and quietly asks for her help. He needs a shotgun to make good on his escape plan. Undecided about helping him, Linda returns to the saloon and encounters a drunken Lee Smithers, who callously admits to raping and killing Morgan's wife. Linda throws her drink in his face and storms out. She notices a shotgun behind the bar.As dusk falls, Belden decides on a desperate move. He tells Morgan he is coming up to talk, man to man. Morgan agrees, but the unarmed Belden arranges for two of his gunmen to trail him up the stairs. While Morgan is distracted by his conversation with Belden, the two men creep down the hallway. One of them makes a noise and Morgan reacts just in the nick of time, shooting one of them and driving the other back down the stairs. Belden throws something at Morgan but misses. An angry Morgan drives him from the room.In the meantime, Linda slips behind the saloon bar and retrieves the shotgun, hiding it under her shawl. She takes it to Morgan, knowing she will pay a steep price. As Morgan calculates a way to get Rick to the train platform, Lee Smithers sets fire to the rear of the hotel, hoping to drive Morgan into the open. Morgan is forced to unshackle Rick from the bed, and a fierce struggle over the shotgun ensues. Morgan wins the battle, and as the hotel burns down Morgan handcuffs himself to Rick and descends the stairs with the sawed-off, double-barrelled shotgun pressed under Rick's chin. Belden and his men are stymied. Morgan warns that if one shot is fired he will decapitate Rick with the shotgun. Morgan and Rick mount a buckboard and start slowly toward the train platform. Belden, his gunmen, and Lee Smithers trail the wagon slowly down the street, waiting for an opening.Just as the train pulls in, Morgan shrewdly eases the wagon across the tracks in front of the train, separating himself and his prisoner from the rest of the crowd. Only Smithers is on the same side of the tracks as Morgan and Rick. Running out of time, Smithers makes his move. He taunts Morgan, daring the lawman to draw against him. Smithers finally pulls his gun and fires at Morgan, striking Rick Belden instead. Morgan lowers the shotgun and discharges a full load of buckshot into Smithers just before Rick falls from the wagon, mortally wounded. Still bound to his prisoner, Morgan falls with him. He unlocks the handcuffs and wearily walks away to board the train. Craig Belden runs around the train to discover his dead son on the ground. He grieves over him for a few moments before angrily calling out to Matt Morgan. Morgan tells Belden that it is over. There is nothing more to fight about. But Belden demands satisfaction. The two men square off, but Morgan stipulates that he won't draw first. Belden obliges, pulling his revolver before Morgan guns him down. As Belden dies, he asks Morgan for the name of his young son, Petey. With his last breath, he admonishes Morgan to ""raise him right."" The train pulls out with Morgan on board as Linda grieves over the fallen Craig Belden."

Faced with bankruptcy, and having had no reply to its protests, the Duchy decides to declare war on the United States, Mountjoy having reasoned that it will certainly lose and will then be magnificently rehabilitated by the generous, victorious Americans. A Declaration of War is duly sent, but is considered a press-room joke by its recipient in Washington.Tully Bascombe, his lieutenant Will Buckley (William Hartnell), and twenty soldiers, in chain mail and armed with longbows, including Roger (Timothy Bateson) and Cobbley (Monte Landis) and (Alan Gifford), are sent to invade the United States, making the first part of their journey by bus and then by tramp steamer, captained by Pedro (Harold Kasket), encountering, en route, the QEII (captain Stuart Saunders, second officer Ken Stanley), which they mistakenly attack.In New York, an air-raid exercise has closed the entire city, with the exception of the laboratory of Professor Alfred Kokintz (David Kossoff) at the New York Institute of Physics, where he and his daughter Helen (Jean Seberg) are working on the new Q-bomb: an air-raid warden (Wally Brown) tries to get them to take shelter, but the Professor shows him the Q-bomb - an active working model on a hair-trigger - which he must deactivate first. The Grand Fenwick party land, but can find no-one to surrender to: in Central Park, they encounter a decontamination squad, Mulligan (Richard Gatehouse) and O'Hara (George Margo), who believe the Fenwickians in their shiny mail are ""men from Mars"" invading the city: this rumour rapidly spreads through the crowds in the shelters. The Grand Fenwick party takes the decontamination squad's van, trying to reach the Arsenal, but instead end up at the Institute of Physics, where they take Prof. Kokintz, Helen and the Q-bomb captive.General Snippet (Macdonald Parke), in charge of the New York exercise, alerted by an army captain (Bill Edwards) of the spread of rumours of ""men from Mars"", arrives with four New York policemen (Bill Nagy): they are also taken captive. Leaving the Grand Fenwick flag flying from the New York customs shed, the Grand Fenwick party re-embarks and returns home. Prof. Kokintz persuades Helen to try and seduce Tully, to persuade him to allow her father to deactivate the Q-bomb, but Tully, seasick, is unreceptive. In France, the Americans cannot get anyone (ticket collector, Jacques Cey) to listen to them.Back in Grand Fenwick the whole country is excitedly preparing to welcome the American victors, and planning what to spend the money on: they are dumbfounded when Tully arrives with his prisoners and declares that Grand Fenwick won. The Q-bomb is taken to the dungeons, Prof. Kokintz and his daughter to the castle, and the General and policemen to the ""Museum of Ancient Torture"" before the policemen are also taken to comfortable quarters in the castle: the General, insisting on his exact rights under the Geneva Convention, is shown to a small, dim cell with a tin plate of food.The U.S. Secretary of Defense (Austin Wills) finally puts together the pieces and realizes that the United States has been defeated: he has to tell the President, persuade the Pentagon generals (Lionel Murton) that this is the only course, and then go to Grand Fenwick to surrender. Meanwhile Grand Fenwick by its possession of the Q-bomb has now become the most powerful nation on the planet, as explained by the BBC Announcer (Colin Gordon).In Grand Fenwick's parliament, messages of support arrive from numerous other countries - all offering also to take the Q-bomb. The British (Charles Clay), French (Henry de Bray) and Soviet (Guy Deghy) Ambassadors convene at the frontier, and Will Buckley makes the U.S. Secretary of Defense, arriving to discuss the U.S.'s surrender, wait also. In frustration, Mountjoy and Bentner, and their parties, all resign, leaving Tully as the new Prime Minister.Mountjoy and Bentner now decide the only course is to help the Americans to escape and take the Q-bomb with them: they release the General and policemen, and give them the Q-bomb, and they also persuade Helen to leave, but not before Tully has declared his love for her: Prof. Kokintz, being entertained by the Duchess on the harpsichord, cannot be found. Taking the Duchess' elderly car, the Americans drive away, but are pursued by Tully. The car stalls and has to be pushed over a hill-crest: it then runs away with the General and the Q-bomb on board, running into a haystack, which sets the Q-bomb into high alert mode: tossed from hand to hand, it is captured by Tully and returned to the Duchy.Tully and the U.S. Secretary of Defense now discuss the peace treaty terms; the Californian wine will be discontinued, Prof. Kokintz and Helen, who will now marry Tully, will remain in Grand Fenwick, and so will the Q-bomb: as the Duchess points out, any atomic war would destroy Grand Fenwick anyway, and the big nations have not succeeded in nuclear disarmament, so now it is time for a League of Little Nations to try.Prof. Kokintz, finally allowed to disarm the Q-bomb, drops it! It was a dud all along: or was it? The little white mouse that emerges from it may know."

Archaeologists Stephen Banning [Felix Aylmer] and Joseph Whemple [Raymond Huntley] take it to show to Stephen's son John [Peter Cushing] who is resting in a nearby tent because he has a broken leg. They believe the badge indicates they are close to finding the concealed tomb of Princess Ananka on the basis that the badge may have come from one of her soldiers. Despite their excitement they are also concerned about the implications of John's leg having not been treated and therefore not healing properly. At the entrance to the tomb, they are stopped by an Egyptian man Mehemet Bey [George Pastell] who implores them not to open the tomb for fear of the consequences but Stephen and Joseph ignore him and enter. Inside they find the sarcophagus of the Princess. Joseph goes back outside to tell John of their discovery. Stephen remains inside and finds a scroll of life but as he picks it up a door in the wall of the tomb opens behind him. Outside, Joseph and John hear Stephen scream and Joseph re-enters the tomb to find Stephen comatose.Several months later and Joseph and John are removing the last of the relics from the tomb.

John does not believe him but Stephen warns him that someone has the scroll and the mummy will be released again.Two drunk men leave a nearby pub to transport a wooden crate on their horse and cart. At the nursing home, Stephen becomes agitated about the mummy again and smashes the window just as the horse and cart pass. The crate on the cart starts bouncing about so the men panic and increase their speed, but the crate becomes loose and falls off the cart into a watery bog. The police and men search for the crate but are unable to find it. Mehemet Bey appears and tells the police the men were transporting the crate to him at a nearby large house and that it contained ancient relics.At the nursing home, the doctor [Willoughby Gray] explains to John that Stephen has had to be restrained but they do not really understand the reasons for his agitation.At the bog, Mehemet Bey reads the scroll of life to resurrect the mummy [Christopher Lee]. Bey instructs the mummy to seek out those who desecrated the tomb and take vengeance against them. The mummy goes to the mental hospital, breaks through the bars of the window to Stephen's room and strangles him.At the subsequent inquest the conclusion is forced entry and murder by person or persons unknown. Joseph and John return home to look through Stephen's papers in an attempt to discover who may have wished Stephen harm. They discuss the discovery of Princess Ananka's tomb and the point when Stephen lost his mind. John reads the story of Princess Ananka's death from illness on a pilgrimage.In a flashback the body of Princess Ananka [Yvonne Furneaux] is anointed in a ceremony overseen by her high priest Kharis [Christopher Lee]. Her body is taken in a long procession by Kharis to be entombed along with various symbolic relics and statues. Her body is laid to rest in a tomb in the side of a mountain a thousand miles from her home. In various ceremonies over the following days slaves and maidens are sacrificed to ensure the location of the tomb remains a secret. Finally Kharis returns to the tomb alone with the scroll of life. He had secretly been in love with Ananka, which was forbidden for a priest, and tries to bring her back to life by reading the scroll. However, he is caught in the act and sentenced to have his tongue cut out and to remain on guard for eternity at the tomb. He is wrapped in bandages and buried alive in a secret chamber next to Ananka in the tomb.Joseph and John think that Stephen possibly lost his mind over the myths in the story of Ananka and Kharis.At his house Bey offer a prayer to his Egyptian god and instructs the mummy of Kharis to destroy the second of the tomb's desecrators. As the mummy walks through the woods it is seen by a poacher [Michael Ripper] who flees to a nearby pub. The mummy bursts through the door of Joseph and John's house and strangles Joseph. John is unable to stop the mummy so runs to get a gun. He fires several shots, hitting the mummy a few times as it leaves but to no effect.Inspector Mulrooney [Eddie Byrne] arrives at the house and John explains that he believes it was a mummy that murdered Joseph, because of Stephen and Joseph's discovery of Princess Ananka's tomb. In a flashback, Stephen is shown reading the scroll of life in the tomb and the mummified Kharis coming back to life. As Stephen screams, Bey enters the tomb and orders the mummy back into its burial chamber. Bey leaves with the scroll. Mulrooney does not believe John's story about the mummy killing Joseph, saying he wants facts. John warns Mulrooney that he may be next to be killed.At the police station, the poacher is brought in and describes to Mulrooney the figure he saw in the woods. Mulrooney also interviews one of the men who transported the crate, and the policeman who searched for the crate in the bog and spoke to Bey.Bey offers another prayer to his god and instructs the mummy to destroy the last of the tomb's desecrators.At his home John notices that his wife Isobel [Yvonne Furneaux] bears a striking resemblance to a picture of Princess Ananka. John mentions his fears about being attacked by the mummy to Isobel and asks her to remain upstairs where she will be safe. John gets a shotgun ready as the mummy makes its way towards his house. The mummy breaks in through the windows and John shoots it but to no avail. He then impales the mummy with a spear but the mummy still attacks and starts to strangle him. Isobel runs downstairs and when the mummy sees her he stops strangling John. The mummy approaches Isobel calmly because of her resemblance to Princess Ananka, then leaves the house quietly.Mulrooney returns to the house now believing John's story and asks John about the Egyptian man living in the house near the nursing home. After Mulrooney leaves, John heads towards Bey's house. Inside the house Bey believes the mummy has killed all three desecrators and orders the mummy to rest before they return home. John arrives at Bey's house and they exchange courtesies. Bey wonders why archaeologists like John desecrate Egyptian tombs which were meant to be sealed for all time and John explains it is so they can understand history and civilisation. John expresses his opinion that the ancient Egyptians lacked intelligence because they believed in a worthless god and sacrificed people violently. Bey disagrees as it is part of Egyptian culture and suggests John should be punished for his views. John apologises and in the process of leaving notices Bey has the seal to Ananka's tomb on a table. Bey returns to pray to his god to apologise for his failure and promises that he will ensure the last desecrator will be dead before sunrise.John returns home and he, Isobel and Mulrooney prepare for the arrival of the mummy with loaded guns. Isobel and Mulrooney and a policeman hide in the woods around the house. Bey and the mummy approach through the woods and attack first the poacher, then the policeman, then knock Mulrooney unconscious before entering the house. The mummy attacks John and he fires twice before the mummy starts to strangle him. Isobel runs in and tells the mummy to stop. At first the mummy ignores her, until John instructs her to let her hair down so she more closely resembles Princess Ananka. Bey orders the mummy to kill her but when it refuses he tries to stab her himself. The mummy attacks Bey and Isobel faints. The mummy picks up Isobel and carries her to the bog followed by John, Mulrooney and several men. John calls to Isobel to wake her up and she instructs the mummy to put her down. Once she is free the men open fire and the mummy sinks into the bog water clutching the scroll of life."
tt0053125,"['Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","At the end of an ordinary work day, advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) hurries from a Madison Avenue office building to a business meeting at the Oak Room bar of the Plaza Hotel. After asking his secretary to phone his mother, he realizes that she won't be able to reach her by telephone, so he will need to send a telegram instead. When a hotel pageboy passes by calling for a Mr. George Kaplan, Thornhill flags him down, to inquire about sending a telegram. Unfortunately, this also draws the attention of two henchmen, names Valerian (Adam Williams) and Licht (Robert Ellenstein), who mistake Roger for Kaplan because from the vantage point they are standing at, he appears to be answering the page. As Roger steps into the corridor to send his wire, the henchmen abduct Roger at gunpoint and force him into a waiting car.Wordlessly, they drive him out of Manhattan to a Long Island country estate displaying the name ""Townsend"" at its entrance. The car snakes up a long winding driveway to the front entrance. A maid lets them in the front door, and Roger is locked inside the library of the mansion. Left alone, he finds a newspaper on the desk addressed to ""Mr. Lester Townsend, 169 Baywood, Glen Cove, N.Y.""Shortly, the library door opens and there enters an urbane English-accented gentleman (James Mason), evidently none other than Townsend himself, followed soon after by his personal secretary, Leonard (Martin Landau). The gentleman addresses his captive as ""Kaplan,"" and by his questions, Roger can only assume that the real Kaplan must be some sort of secret agent on this man's trail. Roger tries to convince him that his name is Thornhill and has never been anything else, but his skeptic captor will not hear of it. To ""prove"" his point, the man proceeds to recite the elusive Kaplan's recent itinerary of hotels, cities, and ever-changing hometowns, including Kaplan's present occupancy of room 796 at the Plaza Hotel, and his future stops in the next few days in Chicago and Rapid City, South Dakota. To find out how much ""Kaplan"" knows about his organization and their current arrangements, he puts Leonard in charge of extracting the information while he withdraws to join Mrs. Townsend (Josephine Hutchinson) and their party guests. Leonard unseals a fifth of bourbon taken from a liquor cabinet, and with the aid of Valerian and Licht, he begins to force the whiskey down Roger's throat.Having failed to get any information from their victim, Valerian and Licht place the severely intoxicated Thornhill behind the wheel of a Mercedes on a seaside highway under cover of darkness, planning to guide him off of a cliff to his death. Almost unaware of his surroundings, Roger comes sufficiently alert at the last moment to push Valerian out of the car and start driving for himself. The two thugs follow him down the winding highway in their own car. Roger, on the verge of passing out and plagued with double vision, manages to careen his way down the cliffside highway without hitting anything. As he slams on brakes to barely avoid running over a bicyclist, a pursuing police car plows into the rear of the Mercedes, and a third car plows into the rear of the police car. Finding themselves overmatched, the two henchmen drive away leaving Roger in police custody.Roger tells everyone at the police station how his captors had tried to kill him, but in his drunken condition no one pays any attention to his bizarre story. One of the policemen mentions that the Mercedes Roger was driving was reported stolen. Roger phones his mother to let her know he is at the Glen Cove police station for the night. In the morning, Roger and his attorney Larrabee (Edward Platt) face the judge, with Roger's mother, Clara Thornhill (Jessie Royce Landis), looking on in weary bemusement. The judge gives Roger a chance to prove his doubtful story, and continues the case over to the next day.A pair of county detectives accompanies Roger, his mother, and Larrabee to the house where he says last night's events took place. They are escorted into the same library while the same maid goes for Mrs. Townsend. Roger shows them the sofa which should still be stained and soaked with spilled bourbon, but it has apparently been cleaned. He opens the liquor cabinet, only to find it is full of books. When ""Mrs. Townsend"" comes in, she greets Roger like an old friend, and asks if he had gotten home all right. She says that he had been so drunk when he left their party the night before, that they had all been worried about him. When Captain Junket (Edward Binns) mentions the stolen car registered to a Mrs. Babson, Mrs. Townsend asks, ""You didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes?"" Roger suggests that they question her husband. Mrs. Townsend informs them that he is at the United Nations where he will be addressing the General Assembly that afternoon. As his protests continue to fall on deaf ears, his mother chimes in, ""Roger, pay the two dollars!"" The visitors get back into the car and drive away. Behind them, a gardener looks up from his work. It is Valerian, disguised.Roger and his mother take a cab to the Plaza Hotel, where Roger tries to phone Kaplan's room. But he learns that Kaplan hasn't answered his phone in two days. Rogers cajoles his mother into getting the key to room 796 from the front desk. They go upstairs and into Kaplan's room. Both the chambermaid and the valet treat him as Kaplan, since he's the man in room 796 whom they have never actually seen. Roger finds a photo of his host from the evening before, which he slips into his pocket. The phone rings. Roger answers it and hears the familiar voice of one of his recent captors. He then calls the hotel operator and learns that the call originated inside the hotel.Roger hurries his mother out of the room, and as they enter an elevator going down, Valerian and Licht step out of one coming up just in time to join the crowded group of passengers in the down elevator. To cut the tension on the way down, Mrs. Thornhill asks the two men if they are really going to kill her son. The thugs start laughing and gradually everyone in the car (except Roger) joins in. When the doors open, Roger insists, ""Ladies first."" And under cover of escorting the ladies off the car, he manages to elude his pursuers and escape into the street. He jumps into a cab and asks the driver take him to the United Nations. Seeing the thugs following him, he asks the driver to lose them if he can.When he gets to the U.N. General Assembly Building, Roger asks for Lester Townsend, giving his own name as Kaplan. He is told to go to the public lounge where the attendant can page Mr. Townsend for him. Meanwhile, Valerian steps out of another taxi and tells Licht to wait with the cab on the other side of the building for him. Valerian then walks into the General Assembly Building. When Lester Townsend (Philip Ober) answers the page, he is not the same man Roger had seen the evening before. Roger asks him about the house in Glen Cove, which Townsend says is his, but the house is currently locked up with only the gardener and his wife living on the grounds (implying it to be Valerian and the house maid). Townsend says that he always stays in the city when the General Assembly is in session. Roger asks about Mrs. Townsend and learns that she has been dead for many years. As Roger shows him the picture of his captor, Townsend flinches and begins to collapse. Valerian has thrown a knife across the lounge and flees unnoticed, and Townsend falls dead at Roger's feet. Reflexively, Roger pulls the knife out of Townsend's back just as people begin to look at the commotion, and a photographer's light bulb goes off. It appears to everyone around him that Roger has killed the real Lester Townsend! Roger drops the knife, bolts to the exit and jumps into a taxicab.The next morning, the action changes to inside the boardroom of a government intelligence agency in Washington D.C. where a group of planners remark about the photo of ""U.N murderer"" Roger Thornhill on the front page of a newspaper. They consider how to deal with the sudden appearance of a man who has been mistaken for the non-existent George Kaplan. It is revealed that these agents invented a non-existent agent named ""George Kaplan"" as a decoy for their real agent who has infiltrated an enemy group headed by a man named Vandamm. They've succeeded in making Vandamm believe that their phantom ""Kaplan"" is the real agent, by creating a trail of hotel registrations complete with prop clothing and other personal belongings moved in and out of the various hotel rooms by fellow agents. And now Vandamm has somehow mistaken Thornhill for Kaplan. The intelligence chief, a middle-aged gentleman called the Professor (Leo G. Carroll) suggests that the agency do nothing to help Thornhill. If they try to help him, they risk exposing their real agent who would probably be killed. For the time being, they will simply wait and let this real-life ""Kaplan"" (Thornhill) lend credibility to their invented ""Kaplan.""Meanwhile back in New York, Roger calls his mother from Grand Central Station to tell her he's taking the train to Chicago. He has learned that Kaplan checked out of the Plaza and has gone on to the Ambassador East in Chicago, so Roger is following him there to find out what is going on. He tries to buy a ticket on the 20th Century Limited, but the ticket agent recognizes him and quietly calls security. Roger slips away unseen, makes his way to the platform, and boards the 20th Century Limited without a ticket, closely pursued by police. Colliding with a beautiful young woman (Eva Marie Saint) in the train corridor, he ducks into a nearby compartment as the police appear at the other end of the corridor. The woman misdirects the police off of the train as it gets underway.As time passes, Roger manages to elude the conductors while they tally up the passenger count. Then he makes his way to the dining car, where the steward seats him with the same beautiful young woman who had helped him in the corridor earlier. She introduces herself as Eve Kendall. He gives her a false name, but she answers: ""No. You're Roger Thornhill of Madison Avenue, and you're wanted for murder on every front page in America. Don't be so modest."" But she assures him she won't turn him in, since it's going to be a long night and she doesn't particularly like the book she's started. He lights her cigarette from his personally monogrammed ""R-O-T"" matchbook. ""Roger O. Thornhill. What does the 'O' stand for?"" she asks. He tells her, ""Nothing."" When he admits he doesn't have a ticket, she invites him to share her drawing room, just as the train comes to an unscheduled stop. Two men in plain clothes get out of a police car and board the train. Roger and Eve leave the dining car to make their way to her compartment.Presently, Eve is lying on the lower berth while Roger talks to her from his hiding place in the closed upper berth. A knock comes at the door, and the two police detectives enter and question her about the man she was talking with at dinner. She deflects their questions, saying she'd never seen him before, and that they hadn't talked about anything important. They leave to continue their search. Using a key she had stolen earlier from a porter, Eve opens the upper berth to let Roger out.As the evening progresses, Roger and Eve become very close very quickly, falling in love in spite of not knowing much about each other. A buzz at the door announces the porter, who is ready to make Eve's bed for her. Roger hides in the washroom while the porter is there, and Eve returns the berth key to the porter, telling him that she had found it on the floor. The porter leaves. Since there's only one bed, Eve insists that Roger is going to sleep on the floor as they return to their interrupted embrace.In another part of the train, the porter delivers a note into the hand of Leonard, who passes it to his boss. The note reads, ""What do I do with him in the morning? Eve.""In the morning, Eve and Roger get off the train in Chicago with Roger dressed in a redcap's uniform and carrying her luggage. He walks ahead as the two police detectives stop and ask if she has anything to report. She doesn't, and she rejoins Roger. She is also aware of Vandamm and Leonard walking a short ways behind. She tells Roger to change back into his suit which she's hidden on one of her cases, while she calls Kaplan for him.The police soon discover a redcap who is missing his uniform, and they begin to examine every redcap porter in the station trying to find Thornhill. Roger ducks into the men's room, quickly changes, and starts to shave with a very tiny travel razor from the train's washroom. The police walk right past him, not recognizing him through the shaving cream on his face.Meanwhile, Eve in a phone booth is making notes, while in another booth several booths away Leonard is giving instructions into the phone. Eve and Leonard leave their booths at the same time, taking no notice of each other. When Roger joins her, she says that Kaplan wants him to take the Indianapolis bus and to get off at a stop known as Prairie Stop, where Kaplan will meet him at 3:30 p.m.. He asks how he can find her again later. Eve, for some reason, is clearly nervous. She looks toward an empty doorway and tells him, ""They're coming!"" He hurries away.That afternoon, Roger steps off the bus in the midst of a vast open prairie and begins to wait. An occasional car or truck drives by, with long empty intervals between them. Looking around, Roger notices a nearby corn field, and a crop duster at work in the distance. And still he waits. A man gets out of a car on the opposite side of the road. Thinking he might be Kaplan, Roger approaches. But the man is just waiting for the next bus. The man comments on the crop duster, observing that it seems to be dusting where there aren't any crops.After the man gets on the next bus, Roger is left alone again. The crop dusting plane approaches, swooping low over Roger's position. It comes around and approaches again, strafing the ground with machine gun fire. Roger tries to flag down a car, but it doesn't stop. The plane strafes again, and Roger runs into the corn field, hiding among the tall stalks. The plane's first pass over the field accomplishes nothing, and Roger begins to think he's eluded them. On its next pass the plane drops pesticide over the field. Gasping for breath, Roger has to abandon the cover of the corn stalks. He sees a gasoline tanker truck approaching, and he stands in its way forcing it to stop, which it does barely in time, knocking him to the ground unhurt. The tanker's quick stop presents a sudden obstacle to the low-swooping plane, and it flies headlong into the load of gasoline, bursting into flames. Roger and the drivers flee the truck moments before the second gas tank explodes. Some passersbys stop to view the accident scene, and Roger steals a pickup truck from one of them and drives away. The stolen pickup is next seen that evening parked on a Chicago street.Roger inquires at the front desk of the Ambassador East Hotel for George Kaplan's room number, only to learn that Kaplan had checked out that morning at 7:10 a.m., leaving a forwarding address for the Hotel Sheraton-Johnson in Rapid City, South Dakota. Roger can't understand how he could have gotten the message that morning at 9:10 a.m. if Kaplan had already left. Standing in confusion for a moment, Roger spots, of all people, Eve Kendall entering the lobby. She picks up a newspaper and takes the elevator to the fourth floor. Roger tells the desk clerk that Eve Kendall is expecting him in room 4-something-or-other, he can't remember the whole number. The clerk tells him 463.Roger rings the buzzer at room 463, and is admitted by a surprised Eve. She runs into his arms, apparently happy to see him alive, but he keeps his barriers up. Roger also notices a newspaper detailing the crop dust plane crash into the tanker truck killing both men aboard the plane. Roger plans to stick with Eve and not let her out of his sight, but Eve says that she has plans of her own. The phone rings. Eve tells the caller that she will meet them, jotting an address on a memo pad. She tears off the note and places it into her purse, where she also carries a small handgun. Roger insists on having dinner with her, but she tells him to leave and never see her again. Last night was all there was, they're not going to get involved. He keeps insisting that they have dinner first. She gives in, on the condition that he have the hotel valet clean up his dusty suit. Roger goes into the bathroom to shower, and he passes his trousers out to her. The valet takes his suit away. Then Eve slips away, not knowing that Roger was faking the shower and was watching her. He uses a pencil to shade over the impressions on the top blank sheet of the memo pad, revealing the address she had jotted down as ""1212 N. Michigan.""A few hours later, wearing his own suit again, Roger steps out of a taxi at 1212 N. Michigan to find an art auction underway in the gallery at that address. In the crowd, Eve Kendall sits under the attentive and watchful eye of Roger's recent captor, the false ""Lester Townsend,"" with Leonard standing close by. Townsend/Vandamm puts his hand on Eve's shoulder, apparently as a clear sign of affection, and he smiles at her while she smiles back. Consumed by anger and jealousy, Roger approaches the trio, and his accusatory tone causes the suspicious ""Townsend"" to draw away from Eve. She becomes alarmed. Just then an unusual primitive figurine goes up for sale. ""Townsend"" bids on the sculpted figure, and when he wins the sale, Roger learns that his name is Vandamm. By now, Vandamm has had enough of ""Kaplan,"" and he tells Leonard to finish him off who walks off. This whole scene is observed by the Professor who is lurking in the crowd. Roger starts to leave, but Valerian blocks his way at the main entrance, while Leonard blocks the front stage.(Note: It is speculated here that Vandamm's other henchman, Licht, was shooter in the crop duster plane which crashed along with the anonymous pilot aboard. Thus, Licht, from this point, is never seen again in the movie.)As Vandamm and Eve make their exit, Roger is trapped and must wait behind in the crowd. To manufacture an escape, Roger begins to disrupt the auction, bidding wildly and making rude remarks about the art work. When the police finally arrive, Roger starts a fight with a gallery employee to provoke an arrest. Vandamm's men can do nothing as the police lead him away. As they leave, the Professor makes a quick phone call. When Roger identifies himself as the United Nations killer on their way downtown, the policemen call the station for instructions. They are told to take him to the airport instead of police headquarters.At the Northwest Airlines counter, the Professor arrives and takes Thornhill off the policemen's hands, and leads him out onto the tarmac to catch a plane to Rapid City, SD, near Mt. Rushmore. The Professor explains that Vandamm has a house near Mt. Rushmore, and they think that will be his jumping off point to leave the country the following night. He explains that George Kaplan does not exist, but that he and his associates in Washington need for Roger to continue to play the role of Kaplan for the next 24 hours, to assure Vandamm that everything is all right. They want Vandamm to continue on his journey so that they can learn more about his spy organization overseas and his dealings with smuggling government secrets in and out of the USA. Roger learns that Eve is the government's undercover agent, and that the scene Roger made at the art auction has put her life in jeopardy. Roger's harsh words, and Eve's candid reactions, had made it obvious to Vandamm that his mistress is emotionally involved with a man he believes to be a government agent. For Eve's sake, Roger agrees to co-operate with the Professor to help set things right again.A meeting is set up between ""Kaplan"" and Vandamm in the cafeteria of the Mt. Rushmore Visitors Center. While the Professor stands hidden in the background, Vandamm arrives with Eve and Leonard. In exchange for not revealing Vandamm's plans to leave the country that night, Roger asks Vandamm to give Eve over to him so that she can get what's coming to her. Vandamm reluctantly agrees. When Roger takes hold of Eve, she draws the handgun from her purse, shoots Roger, and runs away. The Professor emerges from the crowd, examines Roger and shakes his head regretfully. Leonard prompts Vandamm to leave before the authorities arrive. Park employees carry Roger out on a stretcher, and the Professor has him loaded into a Park Service vehicle. They drive away.The Park Service vehicle stops in a secluded wood where a very healthy Roger steps out to find Eve waiting for him. She had asked for this meeting so that they can clear the air. Eve tells him that she had met Phillip Vandamm some time ago at a party and fallen in love with him. Then the Professor had contacted her and told her Vandamm's sordid secrets, asking her to use her unique relationship with Vandamm to help the government, the first time anyone had ever asked Eve to do anything important. Roger is glad that it will all be over when Vandamm takes off that night, and he and Eve can go on with their lives. But she and the Professor tell him that she will be going away with Vandamm, because they still need her to find out more information about him. Roger doesn't want to let her go, and he tries to hold her back forcibly. But the Professor's driver knocks him down, and Eve drives away to return to Vandamm's house.That evening, Roger finds himself locked in a hospital room wearing next to nothing. The Professor brings in a change of clothes for him to use for the next few days on his stay in the hospital. Roger asks the Professor if he could have some bourbon to help ease his stay, and agreeably the Professor leaves to fetch the bourbon. Roger quickly finishes dressing, climbs out the window and along a ledge, making his escape through the neighboring hospital room.He makes his way to Vandamm's house, where he sees lights flashing at a nearby landing strip as if someone is signaling an incoming plane. From outside the living room window, he overhears Vandamm reassuring Eve that everything is all right, and that the plane is about ten minutes away. Leonard asks to have a parting talk with Vandamm in private. Eve goes upstairs to get her things. Leonard notes that even though Eve's actions that afternoon had dispelled Vandamm's doubts, he still doesn't trust her enough to tell her that the figurine they bought at the auction in Chicago holds a bellyful of microfilm. Leonard's suspicions had been aroused by the scene at the Visitors Center. To prove his point, Leonard aims Eve's gun at Vandamm and fires. But Vandamm finds himself unhurt, just as Kaplan must have been unhurt, because the gun is loaded with blanks. Leonard had searched Eve's luggage and found it and immediately knew it was a fake shooting. Not appreciating this cruel revelation from Leonard, Vandamm punches him in the face. But Vandamm quickly regains his composure and knows for certain now that Eve has betrayed him, and that she is working with Kaplan. He tells Leonard that the solution to this is simple: he will drop her from the plane over the ocean.Roger has to warn Eve. He climbs up to her balcony just as she leaves her room and returns downstairs. He jots a note inside the cover of his monogrammed matchbook saying, ""They're onto you. I'm in your room."" From the upper landing, he tosses the matchbook down to her. It lands on the floor. She doesn't see it. Leonard comes over to speak to her, and he picks up the matchbook, tossing it onto the coffee table as he walks away, not realizing its origins. Then Eve recognizes it and reads the message. She makes an excuse and comes upstairs again.Roger warns her that Leonard found the gun with the blanks, that they plan to do away with her, and that the figure from the auction is filled with microfilm. Roger begs her not to get on that plane, but dutifully she goes downstairs again. The entourage leaves for the plane, and only the housekeeper, Anna (Nora Marlowe), remains downstairs. Roger tries to slip out through the house, but the maid Anna stops him at gunpoint. She tells him that after the plane leaves with Vandamm, Valerian (who is revealed to be Anna's husband), as well as Leonard will return.At the landing strip, Eve is wavering about whether to get on the plane or not. As Vandamm gives his goodbyes to Leonard and Valerian, he also tells them to say goodbye to his sister back in New York (the same woman who impersonated Mrs. Townsend for the authorities). Suddenly, shots ring out at the house, and as everyone turns to see Roger fleeing the house, Eve grabs the figure out of Vandamm's arms and runs away into the darkness toward Roger. He has driven a car from the house toward the plane, and Eve jumps into the car. They speed away. Valerian and Leonard give chase on foot. Roger explains it took him five minutes to realize the housekeeper had been covering him with that same gun filled with blanks.They stop at the front gate, which is now closed and locked. Abandoning the car, they run into the dark woods. Before long they find themselves at the top of the Mt. Rushmore monument, with Leonard and Valerian in hot pursuit. Seeing no other way out, they start climbing down the stone faces. Leonard and Valerian split up and start climbing down after them.Pausing for breath, Roger suggests that if they get out of this alive, that they go back on the train together. Eve asks if that was a proposition. Roger tells her it was a proposal. When Eve asks what had happened to Roger's first two marriages, he tells her his wives had left him because he led too dull a life. The two thugs keep coming at them from two sides, and they all continue climbing down.As Roger and Eve come around an outcropping, they are surprised by Valerian waiting with a drawn knife. He pounces on Roger, and the two of them tussle until Roger manages to kick him away. Valerian plunges to his death.In the meantime, Leonard has caught up with Eve and is trying to wrest the figurine out of her hands. He gets the statuette away, and pushes her over a ledge. She falls a few feet and manages to grab onto another ledge with her fingertips. Roger comes to help her. He reaches her and takes hold of her wrist, but he can't pull her up. Leonard comes to the ledge just above him. Roger pleads with Leonard to help them. Instead of helping, Leonard steps on Roger's fingers. Just then a shot rings out. Leonard drops the figure which shatters, revealing the hidden microfilm. He falls into the depths, already dead.On the summit, the Professor and the captive Vandamm stand with a group of park rangers. One of the rangers puts away his gun.Now the only way for Roger to save Eve is to pull her up on his own. As he finally succeeds in lifting her up, the scene changes to a Pullman compartment, and Roger is lifting his bride into the upper berth. The honeymooners embrace as the train enters a tunnel."

tt0053137,"['Drama', 'Romance', 'SciFi']","The year is 1964. The nuclear war that was waged in the northern hemisphere has ended. An American nuclear submarine, the USS Sawfish, at sea in the mid-Pacific makes its way down the coast of Australia where there appear to be survivors. Docking at the port of Melbourne, the crew, commanded by Lt. Commander Dwight Towers (Gregory Peck) live out their lives waiting for the radioactive winds from the North to slowly make their way towards them, ending all life as we know it.The Australian Government and scientific community, hopeful that life might go on in the Southern Hemisphere or in Antarctica, ask Towers and his crew to take the sub north again to check on radiation levels and a mysterious Morse code signal emanating from near San Diego, California. Towers is assigned an Australian Ensign, Peter Holmes (Anthony Perkins), who will act as liaison officer for the mission.Feeling sorry for Towers and the loss he has experienced up north, Peter and his wife Mary (Donna Anderson), throw a party. They bring in a friend, Moira Davidson (Ava Gardner), to distract Towers so he won't become morbid and depressed. Towers slowly begins to fall in love with Moira. However, he still has the mission to think of and is still very much devoted to his wife and kids, who resided in Connecticut. He has difficulty reconciling their loss and at one point confuses Moira for his late wife, Sharon. Moira offers to become ""Sharon"" if it will help him deal with it and also serve the purpose of assuaging her loneliness and fear of the future, impending doom awaiting. Towers refuses. He leaves on the mission north without telling Moira. She finds out where he has gone from her cousin Julian Osborn (Fred Astaire, in his first dramatic role), who will be serving as a scientist checking on the radiation levels during the mission.The Sawfish first arrives at Point Barrow, Alaska, in the Arctic Ocean, only to find that the radiation levels are actually intensifying. Next they visit an untouched but ghostly quiet San Francisco. One of the crew, yeoman Ralph Swain (John Meillon), who had family there, deserts the sub through an escape hatch and swims ashore. Osborn informs Captain Towers that Swain's contact with the radioactive environment will make it impossible for him to return without killing everyone else aboard. The next morning, the sub surfaces from the bottom of San Francisco Bay, and when Captain Towers looks through the periscope, he finds Swain fishing from a small boat, and uses the sub's intercom to send him a greeting. Swain tells Captain Towers that he found his parents are dead, confirms that there are no other survivors, and apologizes for deserting but says he would ""rather be here to have it"", preferring to die in his home town now than on the other side of the world later on. Towers understands his feelings and bids Swain farewell.The Sawfish heads south to the San Diego area, where Radio Officer, Lt. Sunderstrom (Harp McGuire) goes ashore in a full radiological suit with oxygen tank. He is given one hour to find the source of the mysterious, random signals, with the Sawfish blasting its horn every 15 minutes, and must return immediately after the third horn blast. Sunderstrom discovers that there is no survivor to make contact with - the signals are coming from a silent radio room at a power station, where the window pane had broken and a window shade pull cord had wrapped around a partially empty Coca-Cola bottle which bumped into a telegraph key when the ocean breeze blew through the window, generating the gibberish Morse code signals. Sunderstrom stands the bottle upright and uses the telegraph to send a message to the sub about what he has found. He starts heading back to the Sawfish before it blasts its horn for the third time, and on the way he shuts down the power station's main generators, which had been running on automatic control and were close to failing due to a lack of maintenance.Resigned to their fate, the Sawfish crew return to Melbourne and Towers meets up with Moira at her father's farm. They spend time together, during which Towers receives a phone call - all of the US Navy personnel who had been based at Brisbane have now died, giving the hint that the winds have blown the radiation poisoning to the northern parts of Australia, and Towers is promoted to Admiral of all US Navy personnel remaining in Australia.Towers and Moira then go to the Australian Grand Prix, where Osborn is racing. Many of the racers, who have nothing left to lose, are killed in crashes, and Osborn fulfills his dream by winning the race. When Towers and Moira learn that the fishing season has opened early due to the radiation making its way further south, they head north-east to Narbethong to begin a long-planned fishing trip. The fishing grounds are crowded with people and they spend a stormy evening together having dinner in their room in an inn, where they share a romantic interlude. In the background, more drunken revelers can be heard singing ""Waltzing Matilda"" in the bar room below, which turns into an a capella solo rendition of the final verse as they, unseen, begin to pass out.Returning from the fishing trip, Towers learns that one of his crew, Seaman Ackerman (Joe McCormick), has developed radiation poisoning. The radioactive-laden winds have finally arrived in Melbourne, and the symptoms will soon start to spread. and he now must consider what he is going to do about his crew and Moira. With little time left, Towers says goodbye to Osborn, who closes himself inside a sealed garage with his Ferrari, bearing the plate he received as the winner of the 1964 Australian Grand Prix, starts the engine and repeatedly revs it, preferring a death by carbon monoxide poisoning to a death by radiation poisoning.Towers speaks to his crew, who have already taken a vote and tell him that they would like ""to head for home."" He realizes his responsibility and duty is to his crew. He phones Moira who has been helping Peter deal with Mary, who becomes emotionally unbalanced when she can't accept the reality of their present situation. Upon learning that Towers is leaving, Moira speeds off in her car to the Naval Base. Mary regains lucidity and realizes that she and Peter must face their end and that their infant daughter Jennifer will never have the chance to experience the love and happiness that she has had. She tells Peter that she has had a good life with him and that she will ""have that cup of tea now."" The tea is laced with a coma-inducing sedative, provided free at the Queen Victoria Hospital to the residents of Melbourne by the government to help them deal painlessly and quickly with the end.Moira finds Towers at the dock and embraces him. He tells her he loves her but has to go with his crew. She realizes that their relationship is now over but is thankful for what they had. She speeds her car along the coast so that she can catch sight of Towers as he takes the Sawfish down for one last time. Standing on a cliff she gazes off into the distance as the submarine submerges.The final scenes take place days later, after the last remaining pockets of humanity have died. They show an empty, wind-blown and desolate Melbourne, before the movie ends with a rise of dramatic, strident music over the powerful image of a close-up of a banner seen previously at a Salvation Army gathering in the city centre only days before. The banner prophetically reads ""There is still time...Brother""."

tt0053146,"['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Music', 'Romance']","In Rio, a group of black men playing musical instruments shimmies its way past a bunch of women carrying containers on their heads. Carnival is approaching. Serafina (L√©a Garcia), a black woman, runs to the edge of a cliff and looks into the distance.On a river, a boat crowded with boogieing black people reaches land. A blind man steps off of the boat, bumping into Eurydice (Marpessa Dawn) as she gazes at the water. He frightens her. He gives her a yellow lei to help her forget about it. She offers to help him around. He says that he knows Rio well and will manage.Eurydice leaves the blind man, stepping past a few dancing people. She passes merchants selling goods and more dancers. Eurydice reaches a barer part of the city, and is met by a trolley conducted by Orfeu (Breno Mello), who whistles at her and tells her to come aboard. Then, a different man grabs her and she jumps onto the moving vehicle.Orfeu stops the trolley at the end of the line. A man named Hermes (Alexandro Constantino) asks him if he's going to get his paycheck. Orfeu notices Eurydice sitting alone in the back of the streetcar and calls out to her. She doesn't know her way around. Orfeu calls Hermes to help her find her way to her cousin's house, then steps to a window and gets his paycheck from a man. A woman named Mira (Lourdes de Oliveira), crossing a road, calls out to Orfeu. Hermes asks Eurydice if she's going to Carnival. She says no. He tells her that she'll end up going and how to get to it.Orfeu asks Eurydice as she walks away if she got directions. She says yes. Mira asks him why he's giving Eurydice so much attention, and reminds him that they are going to get a marriage license. Orfeu and Mira tread on.Mira and Orfeu enter a government building and she tells him to fix his clothes. Orfeu tells an official at a desk that he and Mira are getting married. The official asks Orfeu his name. Orfeu answers and the official responds that the bride's name must be Eurydice. ""Orpheus loves Eurydice,"" the man says, ""Everyone knows that."" When Mira asks what this is about, the official replies he was referencing an old story.Outside the government building, Brazilian music is being played and Mira dances heartily to it. She draws close to Orfeu and asks him if he's going to buy her a ring, since they're engaged. Orfeu answers that he has to get his guitar out of hock with Carnival coming tomorrow. He tells Mira to get her own ring since he has no money; Mira tells Orfeu she can loan him some for one.At the pawn shop, Orfeu is given his guitar. He plays it a bit, then is bumped by a man carrying a phonograph. The man says that the shop's workers aren't interested in his phonograph and has Orfeu hold it for him. Orfeu tells the man that he's onto him. The man says he needs 100 cruzeiros for Carnival, so Orfeu gives them to him. The man gives Orfeu the phonograph, but takes its horn part with him, pretending to blow through it. Orfeu runs into Mira, who tells him he got a good deal. She shows him a ring on her hand, telling him that he owes her 110 bucks.In her house, Serafina examines a pretty dress. A merchant comes to her window, offering her bread. Serafina says she spent all of her money on her costume for Carnival. There's a knock at her door. She answers it and finds Eurydice outside. Serafina lets her in, saying she thought it was Chico Boto, her boyfriend, at the door. Serafina asks Eurydice if she came for Carnival. Eurydice says that she ran away for fear of a man who came to her farm and chased her. Eurydice believes the man wants to kill her. Serafina asks her if he knows she's with her. Eurydice says no. Serafina tells her to rid him from her mind, remarking that she must be hungry. Neither of them has any money, but Serafina tells Eurydice that ""the Portugese grocer will do anything for a kiss.""Outside, the two women run across a group of musicians playing instruments, and Serafina dances with Zeca, a boy who shakes a tamborine. Eurydice meets another boy, Benedito, who gives her an amulet. Eurydice says she will keep it forever. Benedito asks her, ""Even after I die?"" Serafina tells him to run along, and the women make their way to the grocer's place of business.Eurydice and Serafina get to the grocer's place and the latter woman puts her hands over his eyes from behind. He immediately says that this woman, not knowing who she is, is going to ask him for credit. He doesn't want to give Serafina and Eurydice a break, but after they both kiss him, he looks eager to help them. The grocer mentions a lighter-complexioned black woman's man. Another woman nearby tells her that some women are smarter than she is -- to which she replies, ""I don't care."" Serafina says if this man is getting married, it's too bad for him. The woman who mentioned some women being ""smarter"" than others says that the lucky couple is coming their way. Serafina tells Eurydice to take whatever groceries she wants and joins the couple: Mira and a guitar-toting Orfeu.Serafina confronts Orfeu, asks him if he's getting married, then goes to Mira, hugging her in an effort to distract her from what Orfeu is doing. Orfeu joins the lighter-skinned woman, whom he clearly knows, then he leaves, saying he has to tune his guitar for rehearsal.Orfeu steps into Serafina's house and tunes his guitar. Zeca and Benedito step inside. The latter boy asks Orfeu if he can make the sun rise tomorrow by playing his guitar. Orfeu agrees to this, since it will be Carnival. Zeca says he'd love to make the sun rise, so Benedito tells Orfeu to lend him his guitar so he can make a melody. Orfeu says no, explaining that the guitar is very old, pointing out where it says ""Orfeu is my master"" on it. Orfeu says there was an Orpheus before him, and there may be another when he is gone, but for now, he is the guitar's boss.Orfeu tells the boys not to be sad, and starts performing for them a song he just wrote. As he does, Eurydice steps into the house through a different door. She dances to Orfeu's song. Orfeu notices two women fighting outside through a window and tells the boys to take his guitar, insisting that they didn't see him. Orfeu runs out of the building, where he can watch what happens next through a window. The two women step into the house, asking where Orfeu is. Zeca tells them that he left with another woman, and they leave. Zeca plays Orfeu's guitar.Orfeu notices Eurydice and asks her what she's doing there, then realizes that her aforementioned cousin is Serafina. He says that they are already close friends. She reminds him that her name is Eurydice, and he brings up the story that ""Orpheus loves Eurydice."" Orfeu tells her to remember the tale of how thousands of years ago, Orpheus was sad, but one day, a voice spoke to him of Eurydice's lost kisses. Orfeu starts to kiss Eurydice, but she pushes him away. He responds that she's ""too young to remember."" But she says she remembers, and it was the melody of his singing that she liked best of all. She steps outside and Orfeu follows her to where she sits. Orfeu puts his hand on Eurydice's hand, telling her to forgive him. He places his head on her hand and they share a tender moment.The boys rejoin Orfeu and tell him people are waiting for him at rehearsal. He tells Eurydice he has to go. Orfeu says he'll perform for her, asking her if she'll come to Carnival. She says she will. Orfeu leaves with one of the boys, carrying his guitar.At rehearsal that night, scores of people dance to exhilarating music, including Mira, Serafina, Zeca, and Orfeu. It's a joyful celebration. Mira asks Orfeu why he's not paying attention to her, and he responds that he has no time for her. Eurydice, standing by Benedito, watches Orfeu. Eurydice asks Benedito who Mira is; he says she's Orfeu's fianc√©e. Eurydice is dismayed by this information. Orfeu asks Mira and Serafina if they've tried on their costumes, and the women head off together.Orfeu sees Eurydice sitting down, and invites her into the crowd. They dance fervently with each other. Orfeu pulls Eurydice out of the dancers' area into a room where women work to give her a costume. Serafina steps into the room, and Orfeu says he wants a nice costume for Eurydice. Serafina says that he doesn't know her. Serafina realizes Orfeu is in love with Eurydice, and tells the women to leave Eurydice to her. As Orfeu starts to depart, Zeca tells him that a man is looking for Eurydice.Serafina tells Zeca to tell the man Eurydice is gone. Zeca walks off. Serafina screams as she sees Death (Ademar Da Silva), a man standing outside the place's window in a skeleton costume. Eurydice says, ""It's him,"" as he leaves. Mira steps into the room. Eurydice runs off, and Mira asks what happened. Serafina says her cousin Eurydice is scared, as Orfeu chases after her. Mira asks, ""Her name's Eurydice?"" then Serafina pursues her cousin. Mira runs to the window as Orfeu heads to it outside, carrying a bloodied Benedito. The boy says he followed the costumed man, who threw him to the ground, then escaped.Orfeu puts Benedito down and steps outside. He's stopped by Mira, who asks him who Eurydice is and if they had an affair. He tells her to let him pass; she orders him to stay and he says no. Mira says, ""If you go . . . ,"" but doesn't finish her thought. Orfeu follows Eurydice.Eurydice runs to Serafina's house, looks into it, and keeps fleeing. Chico Boto gets up in a bed inside of it, wondering if Serafina has come home. Serafina arrives next, looking around the place, then Chico scares her from behind. Serafina asks Chico where her cousin went, explaining she must find her; he says that he came from Montevideo to see her and Orfeu runs in, looking for Eurydice. Chico points him in the right direction and Orfeu heads off.Eurydice rushes into a cul-de-sac and is cornered by Death. She pounds on a wall, then Orfeu leaps down between her and Death. The man tries to trip Orfeu, who pulls out a knife. Eurydice warns Orfeu, ""He'll kill you,"" then faints, falling into his arms. Death tells Orfeu that they'll meet again and departs.Orfeu carries Eurydice back to Serafina's house where roosters and dogs walk around freely. Orfeu notes that Chico showed up and asks Eurydice if she'd like to stay there. She says yes. Orfeu states that Eurydice need not be frightened. A dog noisily pulls at a piece of fabric in Orfeu's hand, and Serafina calls to him from another room, sitting beside Chico. Serafina listens through the wall to figure out what's going on in the next room. Serafina says her cousin is in good hands. Chico asks if Eurydice ran away. Serafina tells Chico to open his mouth and close his eyes. She slams a thick slice of watermelon that she's been feeding him into his mouth, sending juice flying everywhere.While Serafina and Chico fight in the other room, Orfeu and Eurydice enjoy each others' company until he announces that he's going outside to sleep. The ruckus in the next room ends with Serafina and Chico going to bed. Orfeu whistles outside in a hammock, then Eurydice beckons him to come inside with her.The next morning, Benedito knocks on the outside wall of Zeca's house to wake him up, saying it's time. Zeca grabs Orfeu's guitar and sneaks out of the house to join him. The two boys go to Serafina's house, where Orfeu gazes at a sleeping Eurydice. Orfeu sees one of the boys put the guitar into the room through a door. The two boys go to look at the sun as they hear Orfeu singing a song to Eurydice, whom he awakens. The sun rises on the horizon.Later that day, a costumed Mira greets Serafina, who tells her that she's tending to Chico. Serafina goes to her house and finds Orfeu and Eurydice standing together behind a wall. Serafina tells Eurydice to get her costume on, saying that Mira is on her way to the house. Orfeu declares he's in no hurry. The two women go into the house and Serafina puts on her costume, which includes a veil over her face. Serafina says Carnival is fun, but she'd like to be with Chico since he's leaving tomorrow, while Eurydice states that she'd rather dance with Orfeu. Outside, Mira calls to Orfeu to open the door to his room. Serafina asks Eurydice if she'd like to dance in her place, putting her veil over Eurydice's head.Orfeu lets Mira into his room. He is disinterested in her and this annoys her. Mira notices a scarf that Orfeu wears and asks him about it. He explains that it's covered with signs of the zodiac. Mira asks Orfeu if the girl next door, meaning Eurydice, took him to Heaven last night. Orfeu continues ignoring her, and Mira tears up the scarf. The two argue, and Mira threatens to kill Eurydice if she sees her with Orfeu again. Benedito and Zeca enter the room, saying that they came to help Orfeu carry part of his costume. Mira leaves them alone. In the next room, Eurydice asks Serafina if it was Mira shouting in the next room. Eurydice says Orfeu promised he'd talk to Mira about what's happened.Serafina tells Eurydice to pull the veil she wears down over her face, as Mira calls to her from outside. Serafina wakes up Chico, explains to him that Eurydice is her now, and tells him to kiss Eurydice just outside her front door. Chico does as he's told. Outside, Mira walks with a bunch of costumed people to Carnival along with Orfeu. Orfeu tells Benedito to ask Serafina (whom he mistakes Eurydice for) if Eurydice is coming; Benedito goes to Eurydice, who raises her veil and says her identity is a secret only Orfeu can know. Benedito goes to tell Orfeu the secret. They are trailed by Eurydice.On Rio's streets, revelers are everywhere, dancing rhythmic steps in elaborate costumes, singing, and pounding out music with instruments. Mira dances in one of the throngs. Another woman tells Mira to look at Serafina, so she turns toward the veiled Eurydice -- who dances with Orfeu. Mira flashes them a jealous look. Orfeu and Eurydice tell each other, ""I love you."" Moments later, Mira asks Orfeu if he loves her and he rebuffs her, saying that he meant to explain something to her. He tells Mira, ""Now it's too late,"" dancing with Eurydice some more. Serafina and Chico watch the dancing couple from nearby. Benedito and Zeca see Death overseeing the celebration from atop a platform.Eurydice loses her amulet and it's grabbed by Benedito. Mira asks Orfeu why he chose Serafina to dance with him and he rejects her again, going to the jury stand. Mira angrily looks around. Serafina, seeing this, tries to hide her face behind a fabric that Chico wears on his head. Mira goes to Eurydice, yanks up her veil, and sees her true identity. Mira shoves Eurydice to the ground. Serafina yells to Chico that they need to help Eurydice, but a security guard blocks them.Eurydice runs from Mira as the festivities go on around them. Orfeu hands a flag to someone on the jury stand. Mira yells that she'll kill Eurydice and yanks a handhold with spiked ends from a platform, chasing her through the crowd with it.The fleeing Eurydice falls into Death's arms, then sees who's holding her. She runs away, then Mira is caught by the man, who forces her to drop the handhold before she spits in his face. Death throws Mira to the ground.A terrified Eurydice is stopped by Hermes, the guard from the trolley station. Hermes tells her to go to his house, saying that he'll tell Orfeu what's going on. She does as Hermes says. Death follows her.Eurydice makes her way to the dark trolley station. She sees Death and runs deeper into the area, evading him as she climbs some stairs to a platform. Death climbs a rope after Eurydice. She takes a leap, grabbing hold of an electrical wire for support. Orfeu runs into the yard, calling for Eurydice. He goes to an electrical board and turns on a switch, sending electricity through the wire and accidentally electrocuting Eurydice.Orfeu runs to Eurydice's corpse, then Death leaps in front of him, saying, ""She's mine now."" Death hurls Orfeu to the ground, knocking him unconscious.Moments later, an ambulance drives through the partying crowd, with Death riding on its side. Hermes and Benedito stand beside the out cold Orfeu as a man wipes his face. Orfeu wakes up and runs to where Eurydice was. Hermes tells him that she's dead, and the other man says she was taken to the morgue.Orfeu gets to the hospital, asking at a counter for some information. A man at the counter ignores Orfeu, who searches around. Orfeu sees a blue veil that resembles the one Eurydice wore earlier, jutting from an elevator door. He runs up several flights of stairs, still hoping to see her alive. Orfeu sees someone being carried by two nurses, yells at them to stop, and goes to them. Alas, the person is not Eurydice; the nurses tell Orfeu to leave. He exits the hospital, trudging away with Benedito, who tells him not to be sad.Orfeu shows up in front of a police building, and is recognized by a policeman who asks him to sing and dance. Orfeu is far too depressed to oblige the officer. The policeman directs Orfeu to the missing persons door of the building.Orfeu exits an elevator on the building's twelfth floor which is quiet and empty, and asks if anyone is there. A janitor asks Orfeu what he's looking for. The janitor tells him that there's no one in the missing persons office, only stacks of paper. The janitor asks Orfeu if he's in pain, and Orfeu answers that he is after losing Eurydice. The janitor tells him to call out to her. Orfeu says he's been doing that. The janitor leads Orfeu down a staircase.At the ground floor, the two men exit the building, coming to a gate guarded by a dog named Cerberus. Benedito follows them to the fence, but is scared by Cerberus and runs away. The janitor shows Orfeu into a building where an Umbanda ritual takes place with numerous black people. The janitor tells Orfeu to sing and call out to Eurydice, so Orfeu does. A voice speaks out and Orfeu recognizes it as Eurydice's. She tells him he must not look back, or he'll never see her again.Eurydice's voice says that she's getting closer, asking Orfeu if he loves her enough to hear her voice but not see her. He replies that his arms are empty. Orfeu says she's not there and is tricking him. We see that Eurydice's voice is coming from an old woman who is taking part in the ritual. Orfeu repeats that he wants to see Eurydice. The voice from the old woman replies that Orfeu is killing her. Orfeu looks back to the old woman, who says, ""Farewell, Orfeu. You'll never see me again."" Orfeu grabs the woman, angrily shaking her and feeling that she lied to him. Against the janitor's protest, Orfeu runs out of the building.Not far away, Orfeu lies on the ground, where he's found by Benedito and Hermes. Orfeu slowly gets up and says, ""I have nothing left to live for. I'm poorer than the poorest of black men."" Hermes hands Orfeu a piece of paper, who thanks him. Hermes tells him to save his thanks for Eurydice.Orfeu faces a man in a morgue who asks him if he'll take Eurydice's body. Without being told, the man understands that Orfeu will and leads him to a room. Orfeu lifts a sheet off of a body and sees that it's Eurydice. Orfeu kisses the corpse, carrying it away. By voice over, Orfeu thanks Eurydice for this moment. Orfeu carries Eurydice's body to a faraway cliff, and then, he sings by voice over.Orfeu stops moving as he sees from not too far a group of people shouting and dancing around a fire. One of the people, Mira, runs toward Orfeu, saying that she'll kill him. Orfeu backs up and Mira, trailed by Serafina, hurls a stone at him, hitting him in the head. Orfeu falls backwards off of the edge, and his and Eurydice's bodies roll down the cliff, before stopping in a huge plant's growth, both of them dead. Mira's horrified to see this.Benedito runs near another cliff, carrying Orfeu's guitar and yelling to Zeca to hurry up. Benedito tells Zeca to play the guitar and make the sun rise, urging him to make something up. Zeca takes the guitar and plays a lively melody. A small girl joins the two boys, saying that Zeca made the sun rise. The girl tells Zeca that he is Orfeu now, telling him to play a song for her, so he does. The girl dances around, then Benedito and Zeca join her in fast dancing, while Zeca goes on playing the guitar."
tt0053183,"['Action', 'Drama', 'War']","In April 1953 at Panmunjom, Korea, a conference between American and Communist North Korean and Chinese forces convenes to discuss halting their three-year conflict.Meanwhile an area in the neutral zone, dubbed Pork Chop Hill by the Americans, is retaken by the Chinese at the cost of the entire American infantry company. Soon after, ""K"" Company commander Lt. Joe Clemons (Gregory Peck) meets with division commander Col. Davis (Barry Atwater) to receive orders to retake the area and is assured that ""L"" Company will protect Clemons' flank. Knowing that Pork Chop Hill holds no strategic value, Clemons surmises to friend and co-commander Lt. Suki Ohashi (George Shibata) that the action will underscore the Americans' strength while the peace negotiations continue.Clemons divides the company into three platoons, leading the first, placing Ohashi in command of the second and holding the third in reserve. As the two platoons ascend the hill at dusk, American artillery bombards the crest but the men are nevertheless unnerved to hear a Chinese propaganda broadcaster in the central command bunker calmly call out criticism of their foolhardiness and list statistics of American losses.Unknown to Clemons, back at division headquarters, Davis learns that ""L"" Company has been delayed getting into position because they have misconstrued their orders to provide support for Clemons' company. Once the American shelling stops, Clemons' men fall under an increasingly heavy enemy barrage and the soldiers are then shocked when bright spotlights from their own position abruptly shine down upon them, escalating enemy fire. The lights go off, and moments later, the radio man informs Clemons they have received an apology from the American group responsible for the spotlights who mistook their location for another.At dawn, still some distance from the enemy trenches and with his platoon severely depleted, Clemons is unable to rouse Ohashi on the radio and sends a messenger in search of the second platoon. Meanwhile, Clemons' men are startled to hear the sound of trumpets blaring, heralding a ferocious assault by the Chinese. When the fighting slows, Clemons finally reaches Ohashi by radio and demands assistance, but Ohashi reports he has lost a quarter of his men and cannot hold his position near the crest if he divides them. Dismayed by the lack of promised support along the hill's left flank, Clemons orders a small squad to provide machine gun cover there. Later, when the nearly decimated squad returns to report to Clemons, he contacts Davis to complain bitterly about the lack of assistance. Davis insists that the crest be taken as soon as possible and ignores Clemons' protest that he has too few men to accomplish the task.Ohashi reports that he has lost nearly half of his platoon and requests the third platoon be activated, but Clemons believes they should be held in reserve as long as possible. Disheartened, Ohashi nevertheless agrees and returns to maintain his position as Clemons is joined by a handful of soldiers dashing up the hill. Clemons is stunned to learn the 12 men are the only survivors from ""L"" Company, whose two platoons were slaughtered in their attempt to provide delayed assistance to ""K"" Company. The remainder of Clemons' platoon, joined by the additional men, then rush the next line of trenches and bunker and are relived to find it has already been secured by Ohashi's men.While the soldiers greet one another, the bunker is suddenly hit by numerous artillery shells. Although severely shaken, most of the men survive and angrily insist the shells came from their own side. Realizing the exhausted, demoralized men are correct, and fearing a revolt, Clemons lies, countering that the artillery came from a nearby, Chinese-held mountain.Anxious over the long silence from Davis, Clemons meets with Ohashi to decide upon their next action. Clemons summons Lt. Waldorf (John Alderman) and the third platoon and declares the crest must be taken to avoid the continued attrition of the remaining American forces. Knowing that Waldorf is inexperienced, Ohashi volunteers his men to make a risky bayonet charge against the crest. Clemons promises a diversionary action as well as support and the move is successful.Afterward, Clemons radios Davis' headquarters, which have now come under an intensive enemy barrage. Cut off after hearing Pork Chop Hill has been taken at last, Davis is unaware of Clemons' desperate plea for supplies and ammunition. Soon after, ""K"" Company's last radio is destroyed, but Clemons is pleased by the arrival of his brother-in-law, Lt. Walt Russell (Rip Torn), commander of ""G"" Company. The men's reunion is short-lived, however, when Russell reveals he has been assigned to perform a ""mop-up"" action and not to reinforce ""K"" Company. Russell is horrified to learn Clemons and Ohashi have only 35 men left from their entire 100-strong company. Moments later, a messenger arrives with news from Davis that ""G"" Company has been recalled, as Davis believes the hill secured. Clemons sends a terse return message insisting that without Russell's men, the area cannot be held.At division headquarters, Gen. Trudeau demands to know whether his superiors intend to hold the hill, but nevertheless supports the recall of ""G"" Company. Russell departs, taking Clemons' wounded and leaving as much ammunition as possible. Clemons orders his 25 remaining men to spread out along the crest as the Chinese radio broadcaster informs the Americans they have 45 minutes to surrender or they will be destroyed.Using the radio left by Russell, Clemons contacts Davis to declare that unless they are provided reinforcements, they must withdraw, but Davis responds that he has received no further orders.At the Panmunjom peace conference, the American representative angrily concludes that the Chinese refusal to give up the strategically useless Pork Chop Hill serves as a test of American character, and contacts American Infantry Division headquarters.That night, as the Chinese begin their final assault on Clemons' position, Ohashi is wounded bringing Clemons a report that ""L"" Company's surviving platoon is providing support. The strength of the Chinese attack forces the Americans into bunkers that they frantically seal against enemy flamethrowers. The tide then abruptly turns when a reinforcement division arrives to clinch the taking of Pork Chop Hill.The film ends with Clemons and the rest of his exhausted men walking down from the hill towards their own front lines as American troops walk up Pork Chop Hill to relieve them."
tt0053207,"['Musical', 'Comedy']","In the opening scene at a local cafe bar in Rome called 'The Sewer', a group of young local teenagers congregate to listen to American-style rock 'n roll music on the venue's gleaming new jukebox. The club is run by Paolo Macelloni, an ambitious hustler on the lookout for musical talent. His girlfriend, Giulia, is the daughter of Cesari, the head of a successful record label. Giulia's father wants nothing to do with the rock 'n roll scene of the youth of today, preferring the sort of middle-of the road crooner typified by his latest signing, Appio Claudio, whom is is currently promoting heavily.When Tony Bellaria, a talented but old-fashioned crooner from the South of Italy wins a coveted singing spot at the Sewer by throwing a bulls-eye dart at a picture of Mrs. Cesari, Paolo is mortified; Tony's style of music is more conservative that the usual Sewer fare. However, when Adriano Celentano takes control of the musical arrangements the Tony performed Figario's aria from The Barber of Seville to a rock 'n roll beat, the crooner earns the respect of the club and Paolo becomes his manager.A visiting journalist, named Salomone, suggests that the best way to combat the major labels is to put on the music festival at the club so Paolo arranges for the cream of the new crop to play there. The line-up of the groups include: Adriano Celentano and his Modern Jazz Band, Fred Buscaglione and the Asternovas, the eccentric singer-guitarist Gianni Meccia, and Giulia's friend Betty Dorys (who is is also Cesari's secretary).Incensed by the Cesari empire's hardball business approach, which keeps the new music off jukeboxes around the country, club-goers from The Sewer deface all the posters of Appio Claudio currently on display around the city. This does not go well with the local Mafia, who are heavily subsidizing the star's career.At a showcase for Tony Bellaria at The Sewer, a group of mafiosi in the audience deliberately provoke a brawl. The police are called and several arrests are made. Tony decides that this is too much to handle and boards a bus back to his home village in the countryside, but Paolo and Giulia persuade him to stay.On the night of Appio Claudio's ""coronation"", a glitzy promotional bash arranged by Cesari with saturation TV coverage, the ""sewer gang"" invades the stage, installs a jukebox, and bop to the music while a stripper mimes to Betty's song ""Troppo timida"" (""Too Shy""). The nationwide press outrage is too much for Cesari, who suffers a nervous breakdown. While he is away at a local clinic, Giulia takes over the family business and swiftly uses her position to sign Betty and Tony to the record label. When Cesari returns after his stay at the asylum, he finds that Giulia's signings are outselling all of his other acts and he finally decides to embrace the ""new wave"" of music."
tt0053221,"['Action', 'Drama', 'Western']","The town drunk - former deputy sheriff, Dude, (Dean Martin) enters a saloon through the back door. He's dirty, unshaven and broke. A man called Joe Burdette (Claude Akins), the brother of the wealthy, corrupt local rancher Nathan, (John Russell) stands at the bar smiling as he watches how desperate Dude looks for a drink. He tosses a coin into the spittoon and laughs. Dude reluctantly bends down to pick it up but his old friend sheriff John T.Chance (John Wayne) kicks it out of the way. Burdette smiles and Chance starts to approach him. Dude feeling shamed picks up a piece of wood and knocks Chance out with it. Joe still smiles. Dude goes to hit him but Joe's men grab him and beat him. As Joe starts on him, an unarmed customer grabs his arm to stop him and Joe pulls out his gun and shoots him dead. He strolls out of the saloon leaving Chance and Dude half unconscious near the dead body.Joe walks into another of the town's bars and Chance walks in, head bleeding, dazed and pointing his rifle at him to arrest him. He tells him he's under arrest. Because of Joe's connections, there's some men to back him up in this saloon as well. A man stands behind Chance and pulls his gun on him. Dude appears at the salon doors and whips out someone else's gun and shoots the other gunman's hand to protect Chance. Joe goes for his gun and Chance knocks him out with his rifle. Dude helps Chance take him over to jail.The next day, as the funeral of Joe's victim takes place, a wagon train arrives in town led by Pat Wheeler (Ward Bond) and his youthful gunslinging helper, Colorado (Ricky Nelson). Pat and Chance are old friends and Chance tells him about the trouble going on in town. Burdette has his men scattered all over and he only has his reinstated deputy dude and old, crippled Stumpy (Walter Brennan) for support. There's no way he can get Joe out of town to the marshal, - he's going to have to wait a few days for the marshal and his posse to arrive to pick him up. Pat goes off to leave the wagons which are filled with oil and dynamite near Nathan's warehouse, while Chance and Dude join Stumpy inside for a drink of beer. Just as Dude is about to take a drink near the cell, Joe starts to taunt him again about his shaking and trying to dry out. Dude throws the glass bottle at the bars in anger. A package arrives for the hotel owner Carlos (Pedro Gonzalez) and Chance takes it over for him.It's some underwear for his wife Consuela. As Chance and Carlos are talking, a woman appears at the door,""Feathers"" (Angie Dickinson). Just arrived in town, she laughs at the sight of the sheriff and Carlos with the underwear.Chance walks out.Later at night, Chance,Dude and Stumpy are sat at the office. Chance and Stumpy see that Dude is restless and suffering with the drying out process.Realising he needs a distraction, Chance tells Stumpy that he and Dude are going to patrol the town. As they wander the street, Carlos comes out of the hotel and tells Chance that Pat has been spreading the word around that the sheriff needs some help. Chance goes inside and interrupts the card game that Pat's having with Colorado, Feathers and a few others. The two of them have a talk at the bar. Chance warns him that anybody who goes around publicly asking for people to help him out could end up dead. Pat offers to help him but Chance tells him no. He'd be no good if he needs Colorado for protection. So Pat offers him Colorado's help. As he goes to get him, Chance inspects a deck of cards that Pat and the others were playing with. Pat brings Colorado over but the young man says he's not interested. He's just going to mind his own business. Pat tells Chance that he's leaving in the morning. Chance gets ready to leave and notices Feathers winning another hand. He follows her up to her room to have a word with her. He tells her that the cards he looked at had three aces missing. He pulls out a wanted bill for a con-man and he's identified her as the man's partner. She admits she is but says she hasn't cheated. She says he's going to have to search her. As Chance starts to feel uncomfortable, Colorado appears and tells him he thinks it's the man with the checkered vest who's been cheating. They approach him downstairs and he tries to go for his gun but Colorado's faster. He whips his gun out and after searching him, he finds the cards. Chance tells Carlos to lock the man in his room all night and to make sure he leaves town in the morning. He tells the others to split his winnings between them and thanks Colorado. Colorado asks him about Feathers but Chance is reluctant to apologise to her. He just tells her he was wrong. He leaves the hotel and asks Dude where Pat is. Pat's walking down the street towards them but he is shot by a man hiding in the stable. Chance and Dude run to him but he's dead. Colorado asks Chance if he can help them pursue the gunman but Chance says no. Chance bursts into the barn but the gunman gets away to the saloon. Dude gets a few shots of and thinks he might have got him. Chance lets Dude go in the front entrance of the saloon while he goes through the back. The customers tell them that no one has entered. Dude looks for a man with muddy boots as the gunman watches from the balcony. None of the men have muddy boots. He even checks the barman's to make sure. The men start laughing at him.One of them tosses a coin into the spitoon. Dude looks shameful and Chance looks doubtful about his mind but Dude notices some blood dripping into a glass of beer on the bar. Dude knows he's there. He turns around, whips out his gun and shoots up at him. The dead body lands in front of the bar. Dude finds a 50 dollar goldpiece on him and know it's the work of Burdette offering money to hitmen. Chance confronts the man who told them no one came in and hits him over the head with his rifle. He tells the barman to collect the mens guns and take them over to the jail. Chance tells Dude that he'll let him go in the front often.Colorado arrives at the office with some of Pat's belongings. He thanks Dude for getting the man who killed him and tells Chance that he's just taken him to the undertaker's. Chance has to keep hold of all of Pat's belongings until he gets a court order, including the wagons, which means Colorado has to stay in the town for a while, broke.Chance goes to the hotel and finds Feathers at the bar. She apologises for acting the way she did. He tells her how he became the sheriff and she tells him what happened to her gambling husband. He cheated people one too many times and was murdered. Chance knows the sheriff who put out the wanted bills for her and tells her that he'll write him a letter to stop anymore been put out which she appreciates. The next morning, Chance wakes up late and wants to know why Carlos has let him sleep in. He says that Feathers told him to leave him and that she kept watch on his room all night sat in a chair in the hallway.Chance confronts her about it and tells her it was a stupid thing to do. He tells her she better get ready for the stagecoach.Dude is on watch making sure that the visitors in the town leave their guns in his possession upon arrival to be collected when they leave. Nathan Burdette rides into town with a bunch of men. He tells them to leave their guns while they visit Joe. They refuse but Dude shoots the raines on one of the men's horse and then they do what he says. They ride up to the office and Chance tells them that he's only letting Nathan see Joe. While he sees him, Chance lets Nathan know how angry he is about what he's been doing and the fact that Pat is dead. He tells him that if he and his men even try to attack the office, Stumpy will blow his brother away before he knows what's happening. After Nathan leaves, Stumpy asks Chance why he let him go. Chance says because whatever they are going to do is planned already and if Nathan's in jail when it happens it will just give him an alibi. Carlos arrives and tells Chance that Feathers never got on the stagecoach to leave. Chance goes over to her room wanting to know why. She says she doesn't want to leave town until all the trouble's over and she knows he's alright.Colorado sits in the saloon watching Nathan and his men drinking at the bar. Nathan walks over to the mariachi band. He whispers to them, leaves them some money and walks out with his men as they start to play a slow Mexican tune. The music plays out across the town all day into the quiet night as Chance and Dude listen to it.Colorado approaches them and tells Chance that Nathan asked them to play the tune. He says it's Nathan's way of sending him a message.It's called The Deguelio, a cutthroat song, a tune the Mexicans played for the Texans when they had them pent up at the Alamo. It's Nathan's way of saying No mercy.As Chance, Dude and Stumpy sit around in the office, Dude asks Chance about how he feels about Feathers. Chance is reluctant to talk about it. Dude brings up the fact that when a woman arrived in town off a stagecoach that he liked, he was the first person to warn him about her and he turned out to be right. Stumpy comes out from the jail and asks Chance to go and get him some coffee. Dude tells him that he's finding Stumpy's gun a little stiff and wants to file the action. Stumpy says no and tells Chance to give him his hold guns. He's been keeping them for a year and bought them off the man who Dude had sold them to when he was at rock bottom. Chance takes Dude over to the hotel to get washed and cleaned up. When he leaves, Feathers tells Chance that she's staying on at the hotel to bartend.Chance hears a gunshot go off over at the jail and runs over. He realises that Stumpy had fired at Dude after failing to recognise him and assuming it was one of Burdette's men trying to get in. Dude isn't hit but he's angry. He fully realises the dirty looking state he must have been in for the last two years. And Stumpy feels ashamed that he nearly killed his good friend.The next morning, whilst on his watch, some of Burdette's men sneak up to him from behind. They dunk his head in the horse trough and knock him out. They tie him up in the barn and one of the men, dressed in identical clothes, takes his place in the street so that Chance won't suspect anything. Chance talks to Colorado at the entrance of the hotel and Colorado goes inside for some matches just as Burdette's men approach. Chance is rolling a cigarette and his rifle is out of arm's reach as them men catch him off guard and pull their guns on him. They tell him they want Joe.Colorado sees what's going on from inside and tells Feathers to throw a plant pot through the window after counting to three. He calmly walks out side,he window smashes, just long enough to distract the men and Colorado tosses Chance his rifle and they gun them down.The fourth man in the distance tries to ride off but Chance shoots him too and goes to check on Dude. He finds him in the barn and unties him. Feeling ashamed and with the shakes becoming worse, Dude tells Chance he's had enough and that he's quitting. Chance tells him he's had enough too and that if he's going to get drunk don't expect to ask for his help again. Dude hits Chance. Chance tells him to wait for him at the office and he'll pay him what he owes him.Chance tells the undertaker to bury the men and it will be paid for by the town. The undertaker says there's no need. He's found enough money on the men to cover the costs. Chance realises that Nathan's price offer to get Joe out is going up. Feathers is sat at the bar with Colorado getting drunk and feeling emotional. Chance tells her that he appreciates what she did and offers Colorado a job as his deputy. Colorado agrees this time.He gives Colorado his badge at the office while Dude watches feeling helpless. Colorado goes to collect his stuff ready o sleep at the jail. Dude sits quiely craving a drink. Stumpy tells him not to but Chance, fed up with his self pitying, tells him to drink the whole bottle. Dude pours himself a glass and the Mexican tune starts to play again. He decides against it. He slowly pours the glass back into the bottle and tells them the shakes have stopped. He asks Chance for another opportunity which Chance is more than willing to give him.At night, Dude,Colorado and Stumpy have a little sing along while they sit around. Stumpy says it's better than been shot at in the street, which gives Chance the idea of shutting themselves away for a few days while they wait for the marshal to arrive. Chance and Dude go to the hotel to ask Carlos for some food and blankets. Carlos goes out back but finds that has Consuela has been taken hostage by some of Burdette's men. Dude takes a bath while Chance keeps guard on the landing talking to Feathers. He tells her he won't be seeing her for a few days. Burdette's men want to keep Chance alive so that they can get Joe out. So they tie a thin piece of rope across the bottom of the stairs,so that he trips over it as he charges down towards the screaming that they force Consuela to do. As Chance trips over it,he knocks himself out as he hits the floor. The men also take Dude and Feathers hostage. They want to trade Chance and Dude for Joe but Chance tells them there's no way Stumpy would do that. They tell Chance that he's going to have to tell Stumpy that they've put up bail for his release.Dude tells him they've no choice.Stumpy's old and alone. It's best to release Joe.Chance walks into the office with the two men behind him pointing guns at his back. One man waits outside.Stumpy is behind the bars with a shotgun ready. Chance calmly tells him that he's going to release Joe. Stumpy tells him the keys are on his desk and when Chance moves to get them, Stumpy blows the two men away. The third man runs in and Colorado wounds him.While Stumpy keeps guard on him,Chance and Colorado run over to the hotel to save Dude. But when they get there, they only find Feathers untying Carlos and Consuela. The men have taken off with Dude out the back door. Chance decides not to go after them in case it reults in Dude been killed.Instead he tells Carlos to get in touch with Nathan to tell him he wants to talk to him. He asks Feathers if she now regrets staying. She shakes her head.Chance, Stumpy and Colorado wait at the office for news from Carlos. When he turns up, he tells them that Nathan wants a deal.Trade Dude for Joe. Chance agrees.Stumpy wants to go but Chance tells him he's too old and slow to get involved in any trouble in wide open spaces. Stumpy reluctantly stays. Chance and Colorado leave and walk through the town to the barn overlooking Nathan's warehouse. Chance and Colorado get ready with their guns. Chance is happy to see Dude still alive and well as they bring him out. Joe starts walking towards Nathan and his men as Dude starts walking towards Chance and Colorado. Just as the two men are about to walk passed each other, Dude lunges for Joe and they start fighting behind a wall, as Chance and Colorado engage in a gunfight between the men hiding in the warehouse. Dude knock Joe out and Colorado tosses him a gun. During the shootout, a few men try and escape across the creek to try and get behind Chance and Colorado to ambush them. Chance and Colorado shoot a couple of them but two manage to get across. But two explosive gunshots are fired out of view and the men drop dead. Chance recognizes the laugh belonging to Stumpy. Chance and Colorado are pleased but Colorado tells Chance that Stumpy is near the wagons that are full of dynamite. Carlos arrives to help Chance with a big shotgun. Chance runs out of the barn to get across to warn Stumpy as the gunfight carries on. From behind a wall and out of range of the dynamite,Stumpy throws a couple of unlit sticks towards the warehouse for Chance and Dude to fire at and blow up. The dynamite gets closer and closer to the warehouse and on the final one that Chance fires at, the whole warehouse nearly blows up. The Burdette brothers and the remaining henchmen tell them they give up and come walking out unarmed.Later at night, the town is peaceful again. The remaining men have taken off and Chance goes over to the hotel to see Feathers. As he passionately embraces her, she throws her tights out of the window into the street. Dude and Stumpy are passing and walk off smiling and laughing."
tt0053271,"['Family', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy']","Wilbur ""Wilby"" Daniels (Tommy Kirk) is a 16-year-old boy who is misunderstood by his father, Wilson (Fred MacMurray). Wilson thinks Wilby is crazy half the time because of his elder son's often dangerous inventions. As a retired mailman who often ran afoul of canines, he is allergic to dogs, and he simply cannot understand why his younger son, Montgomery ""Moochie"" (Kevin Corcoran) would want a dog.Wilby and his rival Buzz Miller (Tim Constantine) go out on a school trip with an attractive exchange student who has moved in next door to Wilby, a French girl named Francesca Andrass√© (Roberta Shore), to the local museum. Along with them is Allison D'Allessio (Annette Funicello), a school friend who clearly has a crush on Wilby, but he does not return her affections because he is clearly hung up on the more attractive Francesca. Wilby gets separated from the other three, who leave without him. Wilby encounters former acquaintance Professor Plumcutt (Cecil Kellaway) (whose newspaper Wilby used to deliver), who tells him all about mystical ancient beliefs, including the legend of the Borgia family, who used shape-shifting as a weapon against their enemies.On the way out, Wilby collides with a table that holds a display case of jewelry. He accidentally ends up with one of the rings in the cuff of his pants. It is the cursed Borgia ring, and no sooner does he read the inscription on it (""In canis corpore transmuto,"" which, unknown to Wilby, means, ""Into a dog's body I change"") then he transforms into Chiffon, Francesca's shaggy ""Bratislavian sheepdog"" . Confused, Wilby as a dog goes to Professor Plumcutt, who says he has invoked the Borgia curse upon himself, which can only be broken through a heroic act of selflessness. After getting chased out of his own house by his enraged father (who fails to recognize him as a dog), Wilby has a series of misadventures while he often (and uncontrollably) switches back and forth between human form and dog form. (Note: every time Wilby changes into the sheepdog, Francesca's dog disappears as long as Wilby is in his dog form). Only Moochie and Professor Plumcutt know his true identity, as Wilby has spoken to them both in dog form. While at a local school dance in his human form, dancing with Allison as his date, he accidentally transforms himself into a dog, forcing him to run and leaving the bewildered and angered Allison behind.The next day, Wilby, as a dog, and Moochie are talking when Francesca's butler Stefano (Jacques Aubuchon) comes out and drags Wilby into the house. Stefano and Francesca's adoptive father, Dr. Valasky (Alexander Scourby), are discussing plans to steal a government secret, and Wilby, as a dog, overhears. Unfortunately for him, he transforms into human Wilby right in front of the spies and is discovered, but not before he hears Dr. Valasky expressing his wish to get rid of his own daughter.The spies angrily capture Wilby and force Francesca to leave with them, leaving the human Wilby bound and gagged in the closet at once. Fortunately, Moochie sneaks into the house just after Dr. Valasky, Stefano and Francesca leave, and discovers Wilby, who is transformed into a dog, still bound and gagged in the closet. It is here that Wilby goes back to his house and reveals the secret of his transformation into a dog to his dumbfounded father, who goes to the authorities, until Wilson suddenly finds himself accused of being either crazy or a spy himself.When Buzz appears at the Valasky residence to take Francesca on a date, Wilby, still in his dog form, steals Buzz's hot rod automobile. Buzz reports this to Officers Hansen and Kelly, who are in disbelief (as they hear about a ""shaggy dog"" involved in various antics throughout the film) until they see the shaggy dog driving Buzz's hot rod. Wilson and Moochie follow Buzz and the police, who end up chasing everyone. The spies attempt to leave aboard a boat, but the police call in the harbor patrol to apprehend Dr. Valasky and stop his boat. Wilby, in his dog form, swims up and wrestles with the men, as Francesca gets knocked out of the boat. He then saves her life and drags her ashore, which finally breaks the curse. When Francesca regains her consciousness, Buzz tries to take credit for saving her. This angers Wilby, who is still a dog, so much that he attacks Buzz. Seconds later, Buzz is surprised to find himself wrestling with the real human Wilby, and the real Chiffon reappears. Since he is soaking wet, Francesca concludes that he has really saved her from the ocean and she hugs and praises Chiffon.Now that Wilson and Chiffon are declared heroes, Francesca is able to leave to return to Paris without her evil adoptive father and former butler, both of whom have been arrested for illegal espionage; and she gives Chiffon to the Daniels family for them to keep as her way of thanking them. Since Wilson has gotten such commendation for foiling a spy ring because of ""his love of dogs"", he has a change of heart over his allergy to dogs, a promise to change his ways, and a sense of humor (while he also realizes that his dog-hating attitude isn't really good anymore), so he allows Moochie to care for Chiffon as he wanted a dog all along. When Wilby approaches Allison to try to reconcile with her, she rebuffs him and reveals that she is dating a new guy with a hot-rod car. In the final shot, Wilby and Buzz decide to forget their rivalry over Francesca and resume their friendship instead without any girl in their lives to get between them."

Many travel to pay their respects to the birth of the Princess. Also attending the event, are King Hubert, and his son, Prince Phillip, who have journeyed from a neighboring kingdom. Through an agreement between the two rulers, Phillip is betrothed to Aurora, and their marriage will unite the two kingdoms when they come of age.Also in attendance, are the Three Good Fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. Each has come to bestow a gift on the Princess. Flora gives the gift of beauty, Fauna the gift of song. However, before Merryweather can bestow her gift, a gale wind blows through the great hall, signifying the arrival of Maleficent, a sorceress from The Forbidden Mountain. Upset over not having been invited, Maleficent casts a spell, promising that once Aurora turns 16, she'll prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel, and die. Stephen orders Maleficent captured, but she disappears with a laugh and a plume of smoke.Flora and Fauna persuade Merryweather to use her 'gift' to possibly stave off Maleficent's spell. Through her 'gift,' Aurora will not die, but only lay in sleep, until kissed by her true love. Even so, King Stephen still is fearful, and orders every spinning wheel in the kingdom to be burned.The three fairies ponder what to do to prevent Maleficent's curse from taking effect. They then decide to hide their magic and change their appearances, appearing as peasant women. The three then persuade the King and Queen that they will hide their daughter until she turns 16, and take her to an abandoned woodcutter's cottage.The years pass by, and as Aurora's 16th birthday approaches, the people of the Kingdom rejoice, as atop the Forbidden Mountain, the atmosphere has stayed in a constant clouded thunder, a sign of Maleficent's mood, and that her own quest to find the hidden Princess has not been fulfilled. Maleficent's mood is also foul in that her minions have only been searching for a baby for the last 16 years, not realizing that Aurora would grow up. After punishing her minions, Maleficent sends her crow Diablo to find the Princess.After 16 years, the Princess has grown into a lovely young woman, whom the three fairies have named Briar Rose. On the eve of her 16th birthday, the three fairies (who've convinced the Princess that they are her 'aunts') send her out to pick berries, while they prepare a birthday cake for her. The Princess walks through the forest, confiding in some forest animals that follow her, that she dreams of one day meeting a handsome prince. Close by, some of the animals find a red cape, a hat, and some boots, and after taking their places, create a make-shift 'dream prince' for the young woman to dance with.However, it just so happens that these items belong to Prince Phillip, who has been riding through the forest on his horse, Samson. Phillip finds the Princess, and the two share a dance, though neither knows that they are their betrothed. The Princess is enchanted by the young man, but remembering how the fairies told her not to talk to strangers, runs away. However, she does tell the Prince where she lives.Aurora returns to the cottage to find a dress and a cake made for her by the three faeries. Excitedly, she explains how she met someone in the forest, whom she is in love with. It is then that the three faeries reveal who they really are, and that she is betrothed to Prince Phillip. When they explain that she must not meet this 'stranger' again, Aurora runs to her room, distraught. During all this, none of them have noticed Maleficent's raven, Diablo, peeking in through a window, before flying off to tell Maleficent.Back at King Stephen's Castle, King Hubert is also in attendance, as the entire court is preparing for Aurora to return. Stephen speaks grandly of the future for their children, as Phillip arrives. Phillip grandly tells his father about the 'peasant girl' he met in the woods, and hopes to marry. Hubert is upset at these turn of events, and tries to persuade his son to remember his betrothal, but Phillip rides back to the forest and to the cottage.In the meantime, the 3 faeries have brought Aurora into the castle through a secret entrance, to prepare her to meet her family. However, she is still upset about never seeing the young man in the woods again. The 3 faeries give her some time to herself, but in their absence, Maleficent opens a secret passage in the castle room, and Aurora, under a trance, follows a floating green orb through the passageway.When the three faeries enter the room, they find Aurora following the green light, and give chase. However, before they can catch her, Aurora has pricked her finger on an enchanted spinning wheel, and now lays crumpled on the floor, with Maleficent cackling wickedly over the faerie's failure to safeguard her.Outside in the castle courtyard, the kingdom prepares to welcome the Princess home. However, in a tower room, the 3 faeries have placed Aurora on a bed, distraught over what has happened. It is then that Flora decides to put the entire Kingdom to sleep, until Aurora is awakened. As they finish putting King Stephen and King Hubert asleep, Flora hears Hubert talk about the Prince meeting a 'peasant girl.' Deducing that it was Phillip that Aurora had met in the forest, they remember her saying how the person she met would be coming to the woodcutter's cottage. Hoping to get to him and awaken Aurora, they set off through the forest, only to find the cottage door wide open, and Phillip's hat on the floor. The three deduce that Maleficent must have captured him, and taken him to her castle on the Forbidden Mountain.The three sneak into the castle, where they find Maleficent's goons celebrating, while she pays a visit to Prince Phillip, stuck in a dungeon.

tt0053291,"['Comedy', 'Music', 'Romance']","Joe, a saxophonist and Jerry, a bassist, are two working-class musicians, playing in a Chicago speakeasy band in February, 1929. Though they have steady work, they still owe money to many of their friends and several of the girls in the chorus line. However, Joe, the optimist, isn't worried since the gig they have seems to be stable. Joe does flirt briefly with the idea of taking all the money he and Jerry have and betting it on a greyhound race but the plan is soon discarded.Fortune changes a few minutes later when a police officer, Mulligan, working on a hot tip from a mob informant, Toothpick Charlie, leads a raid on the place for illegal liquor sales. The speakeasy itself belongs to Chicago's most notorious mob boss, Spats Colombo. Joe and Jerry barely escape the raid. Jobless, they try to figure out a plan to earn money; Joe suggests they hock their overcoats and bet the money on a long shot at the dog racing track. Joe's plan fails miserably and the guys are more broke than ever during a bitterly cold Chicago winter.Joe and Jerry go to the offices of their talent agents, whom have no work for them. They go to the last one, Sig Poliakoff's, where Joe talks to the receptionist, Nellie, whom he has been dating. She tells him that Poliakoff has openings for a sax player and bass player in a band that will be traveling to Florida. In Sig's office, Sig is on the phone frantically trying to find replacement musicians for Sweet Sue, the band's leader, and her assistant, Beinstock. Sue's band is all-female and she has a strict ""NO MEN"" policy; Sue's frustrated because one of her players got pregnant and another ran off to get engaged. Jerry and Joe, not knowing Sue is looking for women, burst into Sig's office and ask for the gig. Poliakoff informs them that they're the wrong gender, but he does have a gig in Urbana, Illinois, for one night. Joe and Jerry accept and con Nellie into loaning them her car to drive to the gig.Joe and Jerry go to the garage where Nellie's car awaits. The garage happens to belong to Toothpick Charlie and a group of shady-looking men are playing cards in the corner. While the mechanic fills the car with gas, a large limo rolls into the garage and several gang members, armed with shotguns and Thompson machine guns get out. Joe and Jerry hide behind Nellie's car while everyone else is lined up against the wall. The gangsters who burst into the place work for Spats Colombo, who steps from the limo. He has come to Charlie's garage seeking revenge for the bust at his speakeasy. He gives the command and his men slaughter everyone against the wall (a reference to the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre perpetrated by Al Capone). The gas nozzle in Nellie's car suddenly pops out when the tank is full and clatters on the ground, drawing the attention of Spats' men, who see Joe and Jerry. Spats orders them to be killed too, while at the same time, Charlie, still alive, tries to reach a nearby phone. Spats grabs a Thompson and brutally finishes Charlie off, temporarily forgetting Joe and Jerry, who escape. One of Spats' goons shoots at them but only succeeds in hitting Jerry's bass. Joe and Jerry, now on the run, call Poliakoff's office, planning to fool their agent into thinking they're the women musicians needed for Sweet Sue's band.Joe and Jerry, dressed as women, arrive at the train station. They use false names; Joe becomes Josephine and Jerry becomes Daphne (he'd originally agreed to be Geraldine, but tells Joe he never liked the name). They meet Sue and Beinstock and fool them effectively enough to be hired. They also spot the band's singer and ukulele player, the attractive and blond Sugar Kowalczyk, who goes by ""Sugar Kane."" Both men are instantly attracted to her, especially Joe.During a band practice on the train Sugar drops a flask of bourbon; alcohol is strictly forbidden by Sue. Beinstock reminds Sugar that he warned her not to hide liquor, however, Jerry tells them it's his flask and covers for Sugar. Later that night, Sugar sneaks into Jerry's berth to thank Daphne for covering for her. Jerry suggests that they both share a drink of whiskey, which Jerry steals from Joe's suitcase in the berth below his. The other women in the band quickly discover Jerry and Sugar and assume they're having a party. Joe and Sugar go to the ladies' room to prepare some ice and during their conversation, Sugar tells Joe that she's had bad luck with romance and men and that she has a soft-spot for saxophone players. Joe is floored but keeps his composure and they share a drink together. In his berth, Jerry finds that the other girls are becoming a bit too physical and, afraid they'll find out his true identity, pulls the emergency cord, stopping the train. All the girls spill out of his berth and the party grinds to halt, Sweet Sue flustered by the whole ordeal.The train arrives in Florida and the band is taken to their hotel. Joe leaves Jerry to carry all their luggage and as Jerry climbs the steps to the entrance, he loses a shoe. A rich man, Osgood Fielding III places it back on her feet and proceeds with improper advances toward Jerry's alter ego. Jerry slaps Osgood after he gropes him in the elevator. In their room, Jerry tells Joe they should leave the band and go further into hiding. Joe tells him they should stay in disguise since Colombo's gang would never look for them in an all-woman band. Joe is also attracted to Sugar, though he doesn't sight that as a reason for staying, and has his own plans to woo her. Sugar shows up and invites the two to the beach; Jerry joins her but Joe declines. After they leave, Joe takes out a suitcase he'd stolen from Beinstock (along with the man's glasses) and dresses up in a fashionable sailor's outfit. Joe goes down to the beach and sits in a chair, reading the Wall Street Journal. He attracts the attention of Sugar and presents himself as an heir to the Shell Oil Corporation. Sugar begins to flirt with him, however, he remains aloof, telling her he's waiting for a signal from his yacht offshore. Jerry happens by and almost instantly recognizes Joe. He convinces Sugar to go back to his and Joe's hotel room to expose him as an impostor. Joe beats them back there and they find him in the tub, covered with bubbles and posing as Josephine. Sugar tells Josephine that she's probably met a millionaire and she leaves. When she does, Jerry launches into a tirade about faking an identity on the beach and that Joe is trying to take advantage of Sugar. A furious Joe responds by rising slowly out of the tub, still in his Shell Oil Jr. outfit, and plops his wet wig down on Jerry's head. Jerry receives a ship-to-shore call from Osgood: Osgood wants to invite Daphne to have dinner with him aboard his yacht. Joe takes charge of the invitation and tells Jerry to persuade Osgood to take him to a dinner and dancing club instead of the yacht. Joe will go to the yacht as Shell Oil Jr. with Sugar.That night, while Joe & Jerry play with the band at dinner, Jerry receives a giant bouquet of flowers from Osgood. When the gig ends, Joe rushes back to his room and assumes the disguise, while Jerry and Osgood go to the restaurant. Joe arrives at the dock just before Sugar and takes her to the yacht on Osgood's boat. While the two have drinks and eat, Joe again acts aloof towards Sugar, trying to persuade her to kiss him. At first he acts as though he has a psychological block that prevents him from enjoying their romantic evening, but Sugar eventually turns him on. On the shore, Osgood and Jerry dance the tango at a nearby roadhouse all night, Jerry seemingly enjoying the date.Sugar and Joe return to the mainland near dawn, apparently in love. He bids farewell to Sugar and climbs up to his room where Jerry is lying on one of the beds. Jerry tells Joe he's engaged; when Joe asks ""who's the lucky girl?"" Jerry says he is himself because Osgood proposed to Daphne. The two have a brief debate where Jerry reveals his plan to marry Osgood and tell him the truth right after the ceremony. He plans to extort a large settlement out of Osgood and live on the alimony checks he believes he'll receive. Joe convinces Jerry that he's committing fraud and will be caught. Jerry realizes his plan will fail and shows Joe the pricey diamond bracelet Osgood gave to him as an engagement gift, saying he'll return it. Joe suggests they keep it, perhaps thinking they can hock it for cash.In the hotel lobby, Spats Colombo and his goons arrive for a convention of ""Friends of Italian Opera"", cover for a meeting of organized crime gangsters. The organization and meeting are being led by Little Bonaparte, the most powerful gangster there. Bonaparte already has a rivalry with Spats, which has been exacerbated by Spats' murder of Toothpick Charlie, who was a good friend of Bonaparte. Jerry and Joe, in the lobby, spot Spats and his crew and immediately get into the elevator to return to their room. Just as the doors are about to close, Spats and his men enter the elevator; Jerry and Joe's disguises work on them and they make it to their room.They pack hurriedly and Joe wants to take care of one last detail: Sugar. He calls her and once again uses his Shell Oil Jr. voice, telling her that he has to leave suddenly. His parents have told him to marry a woman who is the daughter of another millionaire with a large empire. As a final gesture, Joe leaves a bouquet of flowers outside Sugar's room with Osgood's diamond bracelet (the gift to Jerry) hidden inside. Sugar is devastated but accepts the gift.Jerry and Joe climb out the window to avoid running into the gangsters again. However, their path takes them right past Spats' balcony and they're spotted. Spats grabs the bass Jerry left behind and sees the bullet holes from when the two escaped in Chicago. Spats and his men chase them through the hotel but lose them. At one point, Jerry and Joe disguise themselves as a bellhop and a man in a wheelchair and duck into a banquet room, the same room all the gangsters will be eating dinner in. While they hide under the huge table, a pair of shoes with spats on them slides under the table. The two sit still and wait.Little Bonaparte begins the meeting with a lengthy criticism of Spats himself, admonishing him for the assassination on Valentine's Day and for sloppily letting Jerry and Joe escape. Bonaparte seems to forgive Spats' indiscretion and lightens the mood by announcing they will celebrate Spats' birthday. Spats points out that his birthday isn't for a few months but Bonaparte insists they still have a large cake for Spats. After the cake is brought in and lights dimmed, the entire room sings to Spats and a gangster pops up out of the cake and shoots Spats and his crew with a Thompson. Jerry and Joe burst out from under the table and run out of the room. Just as Little Bonaparte orders his men to catch them, Chicago cop Mulligan walks in and demands to know what happened. Bonaparte avoids the question and Mulligan promises to start a federal investigation.Jerry and Joe retreat to their room, fixing their disguises once again. They overhear a gangster saying that they've got all the standard escape routes covered. Joe realizes that they can escape on Osgood's yacht and tells Jerry to call the millionaire and accept his marriage proposal. Before they leave, Joe wanders into the dining and dancing hall of the hotel and sees Sugar singing ""I'm Through With Love"". Moved, Joe approaches her and kisses her. Sugar realizes who Josephine really is and leaves the band, following Joe and Jerry to Osgood's speedboat. They all board it and head for the yacht. Joe tries to tells Sugar that he's a cad who took advantage of her and that he's a sax player who will only treat her badly. Sugar doesn't care and kisses him anyway. Jerry begins to tell Osgood that he's equally as treacherous, that he smokes, has been living with another man (Joe), and can't have children, however Osgood doesn't care. Jerry, frustrated, finally pulls off his wig and tells Osgood he's actually a man. Osgood replies, ""Well, nobody's perfect."""
tt0053318,"['Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","New Orleans, 1937. Catherine Holly (Elizabeth Taylor) is a young woman institutionalized for a severe emotional disturbance that came about when her cousin, Sebastian Venable, died under questionable circumstances while they were on holiday in Spain a few months earlier. The late Sebastian's wealthy mother, Violet Venable (Katharine Hepburn), makes every effort to deny and suppress a potentially sordid truth about her son and his demise. Toward this end, she attempts to bribe the state hospital's administrator, Dr. Hockstader (Albert Dekker), by offering to finance a new wing for the underfunded facility (in Sebastian's name) if he will coerce his brilliant young surgeon, Dr. John Cukrowicz, (Montgomery Clift) into lobotomizing her niece, thereby removing any chance that the events surrounding her son's death might be revealed by Catherine's ""obscene babbling"".Mrs. Venable meets with Dr. Cukrowicz in the primordial garden (""like the dawn of creation"") at her estate to discuss her niece's case, and their conversation eventually turns to Sebastian. Mrs. Venable describes him as a poet whose art was his sole occupation... even though he only wrote a single poem each year during the summer months and never published his work... and recounts her own previous vacations with him and of the poems that he kept in a poetry book that she reads from time to time. Mrs. Venable then reads out loud to Dr. Cukrowicz one poem from the book which tells of one particular voyage to the Encantadas a few years ago where her son forced her to witness the horrific sight of birds feeding on newborn turtles emerging from the sand, a ghastly scene in which Sebastian believed he saw the ""face of God"".Cukrowicz agrees to visit Catherine and begin his evaluation. Catherine has been confined to a private women's mental institution since her return from Europe several months earlier. At first remaining out of sight, Cukrowicz watches as she is caught smoking by Sister Felicity (Joan Young), one of the nuns who staff the facility. When the nun confronts Catherine and holds out her hand, demanding that she turn the cigarette over, Catherine responds by extinguishing the lit cigarette into her palm, burning her. The nun then tells the doctor that this can be seen as proof of her mental instability. Cukrowicz dismisses Sister Felicity and goes on to interview Catherine in her room. She claims that her memory does not extend any further back than an incident that occurred just before she left for Europe with Sebastian, when she ""lost her honor"" while being driven home from a Mardi Gras ball. Beyond that, she struggles to recall the events that led to Sebastian's death and her subsequent breakdown, but expresses her desire to do so.Beginning to doubt that she has lost her mind, Cukrowicz decides to move Catherine into the state hospital for continued observation. Catherine's mother (Mercedes McCambridge) and brother George (Gary Raymond) pay her a visit and reveal that Sebastian has left them a considerable sum of money in his will. Unfortunately, Mrs. Venable will not give them the inheritance unless they sign papers to commit Catherine to the institution and allow a lobotomy to be performed. Alarmed by this prospect, Catherine tries to escape. She accidentally wanders onto a catwalk suspended over the men's recreational area. With the door at the other end of the catwalk locked, she is forced to fight her way back past the men who are trying to climb up onto the catwalk and grope her, and returns to her room in defeat.Later, Mrs. Venable drops by the hospital to check on the status of Cukrowicz's evaluation. The doctor persuades her to meet Catherine face to face. In the ensuing confrontation, Catherine tries to get her aunt to reveal the true nature of her relationship with Sebastian and the reason why she was left behind and Catherine chosen to take her place as his traveling companion, vaguely hinting that Sebastian used them as ""bait"" and that they ""procured for him"". Mrs. Venable responds to these allegations by fainting. Catherine uses this opportunity to slip away again to find another way to escape from the hospital. Catherine finds another catwalk that runs above a rec room filled with women who initially stare at her in silence as she walks overhead. She climbs the railing and leans out precipitously, considering jumping to her death as the women start cackling below, but before she can release her hold, an orderly (David Cameron) comes up behind her, drags her back to her room and sedates her.In a last-ditch effort to help Catherine, Cukrowicz brings her to the Venable estate where he administers a truth serum that will allow her to overcome any resistance to remembering the details of what happened that summer. Before an audience consisting of her aunt, mother and brother, Miss Foxhill (Mavis Villiers), Dr. Hockstader, and Nurse Benson (Patricia Marmont), all of whom have gathered on the patio in the jungle-like garden, Cukrowicz begins questioning Catherine:In a long silent flashback sequence, Catherine recalls how she and Sebastian spent their days on the beach in the Spanish town of Cabeza de Lobo at a posh resort hotel on the beach. On one occasion, he drags her reluctantly into the water, which causes the fabric of her white bathing suit to become transparent. A group of local young men, who had been watching her from the neighboring public beach, start to approach but are intercepted by Sebastian. Catherine gradually realizes that he is using her as bait to attract these local teenage boys in order to proposition them for sex. Since the boys are desperate for money, Sebastian is successful in his efforts; however, he gradually becomes ""fed up with the dark ones"" and, being ""famished for blondes"", makes plans to depart for the northern countries of Scandinavia. On one scorching white-hot day, Sebastian and Catherine are having lunch at a local cafe near the beach when they are beset by a team of ragged street boys playing cacophonous music on instruments of scrap metal and begging for money (some of them being the same teen boys he propositioned to earlier). When Sebastian rejects them, they take up pursuit through the streets of the town. Sebastian attempts to flee, but the boys swarm around him at every turn. He is finally cornered among the ruins of a temple located on a hilltop. In the meantime, Catherine has been frantically trying to catch up with Sebastian, but she reaches him only to see him overwhelmed at last by the group of boys. To her horror and revulsion, she realizes that the starving street teens are literally tearing him apart and eating his flesh. She screams for help, to no avail.The film returns to Catherine, who has collapsed upon the ground, sobbing, and then runs outside the house. Mrs. Venable closes Sebastian's book of poems... the pages of which are blank (there were never any poems in the book, for Mrs. Venable clearly made them up as her own deluded way to deny her son's homosexuality to herself). Mrs. Venable then slowly rises from her seat and takes Cukrowicz's arm. Calling him Sebastian, she tells him not to be out in the sun for too long and that they should go inside the boat and inform the captain that they want to leave. Now clearly insane that the truth has come out, Mrs. Venable is led away and Cukrowicz returns to check on Catherine, who has recovered, having learned the truth. They both walk into the house together."

Ken reserves rooms at the home of jaded alcoholic Bart Hunter (Arthur Kennedy), who has lost the fortune built by his father due to mismanagement and bad investments. Bart has turned his mansion into a summer inn and thinks that Ken, who is a Swedish immigrant's son, is coming to gloat about their respective reversal of fortunes. Although Bart wants to refuse the Jorgensons the reservation, his wife Sylvia (Dorothy McGuire) insists that they are too much in debt to turn down paying customers.The Jorgensons arrive on the island by chartered yacht, a pretense insisted upon by Helen, who is obsessed with appearances and status. A shrewd, controlling and acrimonious woman who no longer sleeps with Ken, Helen tries to repress teenage Molly's budding sexuality and has burdened the family with her excessive bigotry and racism, making it difficult for the family to settle anywhere.At dinner, the boorish Bart tries to titillate Helen by describing his gardens as an ""aphrodisiac."" To smooth over Helen's obvious indignation, Sylvia explains that the island has a history of summer romances. After dinner, the Hunters' 19-year-old son Johnny (Troy Donahue) takes Molly on a moonlit tour of the gardens, where she explains how she took kissing lessons from a boy at her high school. When she kisses Johnny goodnight, the nosy groundskeeper, Todd Hasper (Martin Eric), sees them and reports to Helen, who then blames Ken's Swedish genes for her daughter's interest in sex. Although Ken accuses Helen of suffocating Molly's ""natural instincts,"" Helen scolds Molly and tells her that ""wanting a man is cheap."" Before going to bed, Molly has a heart-to-heart talk with Ken, asking him why he married a woman who does not love either of them. Ken says they married out of loneliness and admits he once loved someone, but had nothing to offer her. He tells Molly that the sole reason for existence is to love and be loved. He is sorry that Helen does not know how to love and that he could not teach her.One rainy day, Bart's godmother, Mrs. Hamilton Hamble (Beulah Bondi), complains to Sylvia about the leak in her water closet. When Sylvia says she has called the mainland for a plumber, Mrs. Hamble, acknowledging Bart's uselessness, asks Ken to go into the attic and check it. As he and Sylvia climb the attic stairs, Sylvia confesses that she has delayed calling a professional, because Bart fears the roof has a structural problem that might result in the building being condemned. After determining that the roof is sound, Ken asks why she has been avoiding him. Twenty years ago, they had been lovers, but Sylvia's mother had arranged her marriage with the then-wealthy Bart. Ken says he got married a week after seeing Sylvia's wedding picture in the newspaper. Both admit to living a ""half-life"" without love, which they have maintained for the sake of their children, and realize they are still in love with each other, but do not want to hurt others. When they go downstairs, Mrs. Hamble warns Sylvia that she could hear their entire conversation through the circulation vents in her room. Recalling how Bart was ""plastered"" at his own wedding, Mrs. Hamble notes that he has rarely been sober and suggests ""straight talk."" She lays out Sylvia's options: divorce Bart and lead a well-planned and discreet affair, or an unplanned, careless affair that courts gossip.Later that night at two in the morning, Sylvia and Ken meet in the boathouse for sex (off-camera). Fearing they could lose their children, neither wants to risk divorce, and so they concede that at least they will have this summer together. When they part before sunrise, they do not realize that Todd has discovered their tryst. Soon after, Helen, pleased to receive damning reports about Ken from Todd, calls her equally crafty and scheming mother. Together they strategize how to entrap Ken in the act of infidelity, so that Helen can divorce him and receive a big settlement.When Johnny and Molly go sailing one day, bad weather capsizes their boat, stranding them on an uninhabited island. After they are rescued, Helen calls a doctor to examine Molly for signs of lost virginity, despite the girl's protestation of innocence. Afterward, Molly runs away, causing Johnny to threaten Helen, who complains to the police (in order to have Johnny arrested to keep him away from Molly). When a mainland policeman arrives and checks into Molly's disappearance and Helen's complaint, Ken, who has just returned from a short business trip on the mainland, sides with Johnny. Vindictively, Helen blurts out that she knows Ken and Sylvia are sleeping together. Seeing Johnny's pain and shock, Sylvia accuses Helen of trying to destroy the children, and the drunk Bart unsympathetically orders Helen to leave the island immediately. To Sylvia, Bart admits that he has known about her love for Ken for twenty years, but was ""fascinated"" by her ""front"" as wife and mother. Although he is willing to continue their marriage, she wants to end it. Molly is soon found, and soon after both couples divorce, Helen slanders Ken and Sylvia, and her accusations are repeated in the newspapers.Because of the scandal, the respective divorce settlements award the children to Helen and Bart, who both send their children away to exclusive boarding schools (Molly to an all-girls Catholic school, and Johnny to an all-boys university). Embarrassed by the scandal and hating their parents, Johnny and Molly feel alone against the world and write to each other over the next several months. Helen finds and reads Johnny's letters and warns Molly that there is ""bad blood"" in the son of a ""drunkard and a harlot."" Throwing the letters into the fire, Molly accuses Helen of making the only thing she has ""to live for"" into something ""dirty.""Although strictly forbidden to see each other, Molly and Johnny arrange to meet secretly at a church during Christmas break. When they kiss in greeting, Molly is spotted by a gossipy friend of her mother's, who reports back to Helen. Later, Helen physically slaps Molly, knocking over their Christmas tree, thus alienating her daughter even more.When Ken and Sylvia marry, they are disappointed that the children do not attend (nor does anyone else). Ken visits Molly at her dormitory, inviting her to visit their beach-side house during spring break, pleading that they need each other. Helen tries to block the court order allowing Ken to see Molly one month a year, but her lawyer warns her that Ken would then be able to stop paying her alimony.When Molly comes to visit Ken at spring break, and Johnny arrives a few days later, the young people shun their parents and spend their time in beach hideaways. One night, they tell Ken and Sylvia they are going to see the movie King Kong at a local theater, but instead, make love (off-camera) for the first time in an ocean-side lookout. When they return near daybreak, Ken and Sylvia discuss ways to talk to them about the dangers of love, without destroying the beauty of it. The next morning, when Ken tries to caution Molly, she bristles at his meddling.A few weeks later, Molly calls Johnny to say she is pregnant from their one-time sexual encounter. He hitchhikes from his college to be with her and they pawn her fur coat, a gift from Ken, for money to travel to Pine Island.

After the Coast Guard takes Bart to a Boston naval hospital, he calls Helen and the police to report that Molly and Johnny just visited him.Molly and Johnny ask a justice of the peace to marry them, but he refuses, because they cannot prove they are of legal age (twenty-one). Meanwhile, Helen calls Ken to say that Bart wants to bring charges against them in juvenile court until they ""cool off.""

Then William Castle enters and informs us, ""I am William Castle, the director of the motion picture you're about to see. I feel obligated to warn you that some of the sensations, some of the physical reactions which the actors on the screen will feel will also be experienced for the first time in motion picture history by certain members of this audience...And remember this: A scream at the right time may save your life."" The screen goes dark and a man's screams are heard. His head (an uncredited Pat Colby) floats towards the audience. Two women's heads (left is an uncredited Gail Bonney, right is an uncredited Amy Fields), screaming, join the man. We fade in on a convict being led to the execution chamber. He is Ryerson (an uncredited Bob Gunderson) and two guards drag him to his fate--the electric chair. Standing in the hall is his brother-in-law, Ollie Higgins (Phillip Coolidge). Title and credits are shown over the march to the chamber. In a nearby lab, Dr. Warren Chapin (Vincent Price) prepares for the state required autopsy of the convicted and executed man. The body is wheeled from the execution chamber to the lab on a gurney. Chapin does his work and Ollie comes in to watch. They chat about the electrocution and Chapin notes, ""This man's vertebrae are cracked. They're nearly splintered in two."" He explains he's seen this before, always related to fear and this is the focus of his research. Ollie postulates it might be what causes your spine to tingle. Chapin is amused and dubs the force, ""The Tingler,"" something he has been researching for years with no name. Chapin asks rhetorically, ""Fear causes tremendous tensions in the body. If you can't relieve them, why can't they become strong enough to kill you?"" Chapin completes the death certificate and prepares to leave. Ollie asks for a ride back into town and the doctor agrees.Chapin stops his car in front of a walk-in theater. It specializes in old, silent movies. Ollie offers the doctor a cup of coffee. He first checks in with his wife, Martha (Judith Evelyn) who is working in the box office. She is a deaf-mute and reminds her husband about working the opening of the theater. Ollie and Chapin enter the rooms above the theater. Martha enters the apartment and places cash in a large safe by the front door. She enters the kitchen and washes her hands. She stares at Chapin and refuses to shake his hand, miming that they are loaded with germs. Besides being deaf-mute, Martha has a serious OCD condition and a serious phobia about something else Chapin discovers after he accidently breaks a saucer. He reaches into the sink to retrieve the broken pieces of a saucer and cuts his hand. The sight of the blood sends Martha into a rigid, dead faint. Chapin treats her and explains to Ollie that her inability to scream allows the tension to build. She does not actually faint, but experiences something he calls a psychosomatic escape. Chapin brings the woman around with smelling salts. Martha immediately checks the safe to verify the money is still there. Satisfied her money is safe, she refuses to go downstairs to open the box office until Ollie and the doctor have left. Doctor Chapin leaves and drives home.Chapin arrives home, a large expensive house in an upscale neighborhood. His wife has money and an independent nature. Feeling neglected at home she indulges her desire for male company openly. Lucy Stevens (Pamela Lincoln) walks down the stairs. She is dressed for her date. She is Chapin's sister-in-law. Her boyfriend, David, works for Dr. Chapin. They are both pathologists. She tells Chapin her sister is out on a date. Chapin takes a certain amount of responsibility for the situation. They discuss Lucy's financial situation, her sister controls the inheritance and refuses to share it with her little sister. The doorbell rings and Lucy answers it. It is David Morris (Darryl Hickman) and he apologizes for being late. David was late because he was out trying to catch a stray cat for their experiment. David also gives Chapin the drug he requested. [Note: LSD was still legal back in the 1950s and was being used by Psychiatrists for research.] David warns Dr. Chapin that, ""It can produce pretty weird effects."" Chapin relays the story about Martha and her blood phobia and her fear reaction. Chapin tells David he is now convinced what he is looking for is tangible and solid. He now calls it, The Tingler. David and Lucy go out on their date. Dr. Chapin sits and reads a preliminary report titled, ""Fright Effects Induced by Injection of Lysergic Acid LSD25."" It is late, 1:00 a.m., and Chapin sees his wife out the window. She is kissing her date good night. Chapin decides to kill two birds with one stone. He retrieves a gun from the hutch drawer, it is loaded with blanks but she doesn't know that. He confronts Isabel (Patricia Cutts) in the entry way. They exchange catty dialog and decide to have a drink. Chapin mentions Lucy and David and threatens that unless she gives Lucy her inheritance, she will be dead. He pulls a gun and escorts her into the lab. He tells her that her ""suicide"" can be better arranged there. Isabel refuses to give Lucy her money, so Chapin ""shoots"" her. She collapses in fear. He places her body on the X-Ray table and takes three pictures of her spine in rapid succession. He wakes his wife and tells her, ""You're not hurt, dear. It was just a blank cartridge. Thanks for helping with the experiment. You played your part excellently."" She is furious. A cat in the cage calls out. He gleefully tells Isabel, ""I was going to use this cat. But you made a much better subject. Have you two met? In the same alley, perhaps?"" Isabel threatens, ""When my turn comes, and it will come, it won't be an experiment.""The next day, David pulls up in his old car. He brought the dog Chapin requested. Chapin is excited to show Dave the X-Rays he took of Isabel. It shows The Tingler in stages of growth and deployment along the spine. Chapin and Dave discuss what they know and what they need to find out. They speculate that The Tingler may be a solid mass, and a living organism. That evening, Lucy, Dave, and Dr. Chapin have coffee in the living room. Chapin wants to scare himself to do more research, ""to personally sense the power of The Tingler, in a genuine fear situation. In a controlled experiment, with my own fear perhaps I can find out all the things we have to know. Only nothing scares me."" Chapin suggests, then demands that Dave take the night off. Dave suspects Chapin may try something stupid and dangerous. His fears are realized. Dave and Lucy observe, from outside the lab, Chapin take the LSD and have a bad trip. Chapin carefully tape records all his observations and symptoms. He is able to experience fear, but despite his desire to stifle a scream, he does scream and the thing that makes his spine rigid disappears. Lucy, David, and Chapin discuss the experiment, and Dave notes that a deaf-mute is unable to scream.At the movie theater, Dr. Chapin stops to see Ollie. He came to see how Martha was doing. Ollie says it must have been very traumatic because she is off her routine. Chapin walks up to see Martha. He gives her a sedative and puts her to bed. He sends Ollie to the drug store to fill a prescription for Martha. Sometime later, Martha wakes. Strange things happen: lights go off on their own, windows close, a rocking chair moves with no one sitting in it, and doors open and close on their own. A creature with a scarred face and oversized teeth menace her with a knife. She eventually is locked in the bathroom and sees blood flowing from the hot and cold water faucets in the sink. [Note: The movie is black and white, but the sink and tub sequences are in color, to emphasize the blood.] The tub is full of blood and an arm rises out of the thick liquid towards the frightened woman. She goes rigid and clutches her spine with one hand. The bathroom medicine cabinet opens and there she sees her own death certificate. She collapses to the floor, dead.Dr. Chapin arrives home to the phone ringing. There is no one on the line by the time he answers it. He finds two drinking glasses on the coffee table and concludes his wife has been entertaining. A gold tie clip confirms his suspicions. The doorbell rings, and Dr. Chapin answers it. It is Ollie and he has brought his wife's body over to the Chapin home. They carry Martha in and place her on the exam table in the lab. Chapin confirms she is dead, and has been for at least an hour. Chapin records the time and circumstances to complete the death certificate. Martha's body rises up on the table, still covered in the sheet. She settles back down, and Ollie is convinced she is still alive. Chapin assures him she is quite dead, but wants to find out why she moved. He removes a Tingler from around her spinal bones. It is about 16 inches long and resembles a black lobster or huge earwig with pincers on the front and back. Chapin calls for a glass tank, but before he can secure the creature it pinches his arm. His screams causes the creature to release the grip on his arm and fall limp on the table. Isabel enters the lab. She is repulsed by the creature. Ollie asks how strong it is, and Chapin replies, ""Strong enough to kill a man, easily and quickly."" Chapin puts The Tingler in a wire mesh carrying case. Isabel grabs a small vial from the lab and before leaving looks at The Tingler with a certain fascination. She pours the contents of the vial into a glass on the bar. Ollie agrees to take Martha home and notify both a funeral parlor and the police. Isabel suggests a celebration for the discovery, something her husband has been seeking for years. She pours two drinks and offers Chapin one, but he demands the other instead. She agrees, knowing her husband does not trust her, but he gets the spiked one anyway. She asks about The Tingler. He explains that it is very powerful. Ollie calls and tells Chapin that Martha is now at a funeral parlor and he has called the police. Chapin passes out from the drink before Ollie can complete his conversation. Ollie gathers up the paraphernalia he used to scare his wife to death: the mask, knife, and other items. As Chapin sleeps it off, Isabel brings in The Tingler in its carrying case. She lets it loose to do its murderous thing. It crawls over to Chapin and proceeds to strangle him with its fore-pincers. Fortunately, Lucy arrives home, hears his struggles, and screams disabling The Tingler's grip on the doctor's throat. It falls to the rug in front of the couch.The next day in the lab, Chapin tries to destroy The Tingler. He holds a blow torch and tells David, ""Nothing affects it. You can't destroy the thing."" Dave is excited at the medical discovery, but Chapin explains that he is not going to share the discovery with anyone, not at a convention or with a journal article. Chapin explains his reasons, ""The Tingler exists in every human being we now know. Look at that. It's an ugly and dangerous thing. Ugly because it's the creation of man's fear. Dangerous because a frightened man is dangerous. We can't destroy it, because we've removed it from its natural place."" Chapin decides it has to be put back inside Martha's body and hopes it will be re-absorbed. Lucy comes into the lab and reports that Isabel has left, taken her clothes and moved out. Dave reports that the police got no report of her death. Chapin grabs his bag and the Tingler in its cage and departs for Ollie's place.Ollie is home packing. He empties the safe of cash. Chapin arrives and confronts the man. He finds the objects Ollie used to frighten his wife to death. While preparing Martha's body, The Tingler escapes from its cage and gains entry to the theater below via a loose floor board. Chapin and Ollie start their search for it. As the audience watches an old movie, The Tingler searches out prey. One woman (an uncredited Amy Fields) screams when it latches on to her leg. Chapin douses the lights and tells the audience there is no cause for alarm. The projectionist (an uncredited Dal McKennon) prepares for a reel change. The Tingler crawls through the opening in the wall. The Tingler causes the film to flutter and break. Its' crawling silhouette shows on the theater screen and Chapin and Ollie see it. The audience in the theater murmurs. Chapin again tells the audience not to panic, and implores them, ""Scream! Scream for your lives! The Tingler is loose in this theater! And if you don't scream, it may kill you! Scream! Scream! Keep screaming! Scream for your life!"" Chapin and Ollie run to the projection booth. The projectionist is being choked by The Tingler. His scream causes the thing to release its grip on his throat. Chapin loads it into a film canister and carries it back upstairs to where Martha's body is located. Ollie admits that Chapin gave him the idea to kill his wife. Chapin places it back into Martha. Chapin informs Ollie, ""This time you're going to the police with me."" Ollie pulls a gun and corrects the good doctor, ""You're wrong. You're going by yourself."" Chapin calls the man's bluff, and walks out. Ollie walks towards the door, but it slams shut on its own. The window shuts and Martha's sheet covered body rises up. She stands and stares at her husband. He silently screams in fear. The screen goes black. We close with final words of wisdom from Dr. Warren Chapin, ""Ladies and gentlemen, just a word of warning. If any of you are not convinced that you have a Tingler of your own, the next time you're frightened in the dark, don't scream."""
tt0053458,"['Drama', 'War']","A patrol of British soldiers is making its way through the Burmese jungle in the second world war. Their radio is broken, they are all tired and trying to stay quiet and out of sight of the Japanese in order to make their way back to their own lines. They are led by Captain Alan Langford [Stanley Baker] and include a war correspondent named Max [Leo McKern], a Padre [Guy Rolfe], and a couple of wounded soldiers on stretchers including their senior officer, a Brigadier [Russell Waters]. While they take a rest, Sergeant McKenzie [Gordon Jackson] and a couple of men continue to assess the area. They find a village ahead and report back. Since the village looks quiet and only occupied by civilians, they decide to go in. As they do, Japanese soldiers hiding in the huts open fire. The British suffer several fatalities but manage to out flank and shoot all the Japanese soldiers. One civilian tries to escape but is captured and brought back to the village. Among the dead Japanese soldiers in a Colonel with a map. It seems unusual and suspicious to the British soldiers that a Colonel would have been in the village and part of the ambush. The villagers are not able to tell the soldiers much other than the Japanese arrived at sunrise that day.Langford questions the civilian [Wolfe Morris] who tried to escape. At first he pretends he does not speak English but when Langford orders one of his men to shoot him, he starts talking. He claims to be a former businessman from Rangoon who now lives nearby and knows nothing about the map, but he has a lot of money in his possession and his answers are not consistent. Langford gives him 15 minutes to start telling the truth or he will be shot.Some of the wounded soldiers are seriously injured and Langford orders that the morphine should be saved for those soldiers who have the best chance of survival. He also orders a couple of men to repair the radio.Shots are fired at the British from the jungle, so a few soldiers go after the Japanese soldiers. They kill one but a second Japanese soldier escapes. Langford thinks they should leave the village because the map could be highly important but he needs to understand the markings on it first. He tries to make the civilian talk again by threatening to shoot him but he refuses. Instead, Langford orders two of the villagers be placed in front of a firing squad. There is a lot of dissent from the other soldiers that this would be a war crime but Langford insists. Max and the Padre argue with Langford that it is murder but Langford argues the moral dilemma of killing civilians in war time in order to save many more other lives. Langford says he will take full responsibility for the villagers' deaths. Langford makes the civilian watch the firing squad but since he still refuses to talk, the two villagers are shot. Only then does he agree to talk. The civilian confesses to Langford that he was informing the Japanese about the positions of the British soldiers and explains the markings on the map and how the Japanese plan to attack the British.Langford orders Sergeant McKenzie to take the civilian informer into the jungle and shoot him. He also orders that the wounded be left behind at the village because they will slow down the remaining fit men and decrease their chances of survival. The doctor [David Oxley], the Padre, and Max all argue against him and the immorality of his decision. However, the wounded Brigadier makes it into the hut and informs them that the wounded soldiers have all agreed between themselves that they should be left behind, so makes the same order as Langford.A lookout spots a Japanese soldier in the jungle and reports back to the village. Langford orders that a few men including the Sergeant, doctor, Max and Padre, should try and make it back to the British lines with the information obtained from the informer about the map, while he and the others remain in the village. The Padre and Max argue they should stay behind because they will only slow the other soldiers down if they go. Lieutenant Paul Hastings [Richard Pasco] is nervous and wants to go but Langford orders him to stay. Langford agrees to send two other men instead. However, the men are ambushed by the Japanese shortly after leaving the village and are all killed.The Japanese soldier reports back to his commanding officer Yamazaki [Philip Ahn] and they quickly group together to launch an attack on the British in the village. The Padre discusses the execution of the two villagers with Langford again but Langford still thinks it was right to sacrifice two lives in order to try and save many more. The lookout reports the Japanese approach so Langford quickly orders the men into action to confront the Japanese. Most of the soldiers go into the jungle to ambush the Japanese, unaware that the Japanese have made quicker progress than expected and are waiting in ambush for the British. A battle ensues in which some of the British soldiers are killed. Langford is wounded and is captured along with the other survivors, who are made to walk as a human shield in front of the Japanese soldiers as they enter the village. Langford shouts to the soldiers left behind in the huts to open fire and the British prisoners all dive to the ground. Another battle commences. There are casualties on both sides but eventually the Japanese overcome the British.Yamazaki asks the soldiers about the Colonel who was at the village when they arrived but they won't say anything. In a reversal of the tactics used by Langford earlier, he puts Hastings in front of a firing squad but he won't talk. He questions Langford too but he claims there was no-one in the village when they arrived. Yamazaki threatens to shoot Hastings but Langford still won't talk. Eventually Yamazaki tells Langford he will kill all the other British men but leave Langford alive so that it will be on his conscience that he allowed the others to die. He tries one more time to convince Hastings to talk in front of the firing squad, but then releases him and sends him, the Padre and Max into one of the huts to try and convince Langford to talk but they still all refuse to comply. Yamazaki lines all the others apart from Langford up in front of a firing squad and gives Langford two minutes to talk. Instead, Langford tries to overpower one of the guards and is shot dead. Yamazaki says that is what he would have done too. After the two minutes have passed, the remaining British are all shot by the firing squad.On the radio is a broadcast message from the British General about how proud he is of the spirit and fight shown by the British soldiers in Burma. The film finishes on a war memorial dedicated to those who gave their lives."
tt0054152,"['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","In the first shot, a quintessentially British man in a dark suit and hat, tightly rolled umbrella, and immobile face, strides along Havana streets besieged by grinning musicians and hawkers. Hawthorne (Noel Coward) is a Secret Service official based in Jamaica charged with recruiting a group of secret agents to report on Cuban military activities for a monthly stipend. Hawthorne approaches Jim Wormold (Alec Guinness), an expatriate Englishman living in Havana in the late 1950s with his beautiful teenage daughter Milly (Jo Morrow), who is attending a Catholic all girls school. Jim has lived in Cuba for fifteen years, and despite the rocky political climate, considers it home. Wormold's spare time consists of drinks with German Dr. Hasselbacher (Burl Ives) and fawning over his daughter, who has reached that precarious threshold between childhood and adulthood.Milly is being trailed by police captain Segura (Ernie Kovacs), who is friendly with the nuns at Millys school, and is looking for a traditional and pretty young woman to be his wife from among the graduating students. Milly, a dazzling blonde, is his target. When the very conspicuous Hawthorne shows up, Segura guesses that something of interest to the police may be going on, and makes inquiries hoping to use the information for blackmailing Jim in his favor, if necessary.Jim owns a vacuum cleaner shop but isn't successful enough, as he wants to provide greater luxuries for Milly, such as finishing school in Switzerland, and Milly has some expensive expectations of her own, such as owning a horse.Jim says yes to Hawthorne because of his money needs, but he has no clue about spying. Hawthorne shows him how to encode messages for telegraphing his reports and gives him general pointers. Hawthorne just tells him to approach people he knows, but that gets Jim nowhere. Jim approaches one of his trusted employees but the man misunderstands and thinks Jim is asking for prostitutes. Several times during the rest of the movie, a prostitute is brought to him by this employee.Prodded by Millys wishes to have a horse, Jim gets the Secret Service to pay for his membership in a hugely expensive country club, with the excuse that he needs access to a place where he meets important people. When he approaches members of the country club, his social ineptitude creates confusions and they think he is trying to come onto them. Instead of spying, Wormold spends most of his time drinking at the country club, which he can finally afford.Jims closest friend, a former German army officer, Dr. Hasselbacher, suggests that the best secrets are known to no one, so Jim decides to pretend to have a list of agents and provide fictional tales for the benefit of the bosses in London. Hasselbacher opines that Jim would not be doing anything immoral because countries feel obligated to play a game and spy on each other, and it might has well be him who gets paid.As he does nothing real to report, Jim pretends first to recruit agents and then that they discover secret constructions. In order to have a semblance of credibility, the names and professions he gives his fake agents are names and professions of real people.When London messages demand some information beyond lists of names, Jim notices that images of his vacuum cleaners, if enlarged and doctored, look like odd buildings having a scientific or military purpose. He sends drawings to England, and the spy boss C (Ralph Richardson) is deeply impressed. Some other reports are inspired by comic strips. He is seen as the best agent in the Western Hemisphere, and the spy agency decides to send him support staff.Soon Beatrice Severn (Maureen O'Hara) arrives in Havana, sent by C to be his ""bookkeeper"" and assistant. Beatrice finds Jim romantically attractive. When she begins to catch on to the deceptions, she keeps quiet despite misgivings.There are others who get suspicious of Wormold at the Agency. One agent comments to C that the drawings look like parts of a vacuum cleaner, enlarged. Hawthorne hears this while he is behind C, and realizes what Guinness is sending, but he keeps quiet.Captain Segura is aware, after hearing of Jims approaches to local fellows, that Jim was recruiting spies, but he bides his time, as his interest is getting Jim's consent for him to marry Milly. Milly accepts some courting, but her interests are rather with her horse rather than marrying.Dr. Hasselbacher, tempted by Jims reports of easy money in exchange for false information, also starts to sell lies, judging that no significant harm results from the deception.Wormolds originally harmless fraud eventually becomes dangerous. As British Intelligence agencies begin to take his work seriously, so does the other side, and thus Wormold is a wanted man, dead or alive.Spys from the other side begin to decode his cables and start disrupting his network. One of the men whom Wormold pretended was one of his agents dies in a suspicious accident. An engineer named Cifuentes (Gr√©goire Aslan) whom Jim approached multiple times at the country club is kidnapped and dropped off at Jims doorstep bound and gagged. These events give London the impression that Wormold's networks are under attack.Hawthorne has Jim go to Jamaica for consultations, where he warns him that Jim's discovery of military secrets is so impressive that the other sides agents have decided to silence him by assassination, most likely by poisoning at a banquet Jim has to attend as part of his vacuum cleaner business. Hawthorne instructs Jim in a variety of techniques to avoid being poisoned by food or drink.Jim manages to figure out the assassin is none other than a friendly man he met on the flight to Kingston, but he is unable to prevent the murder of his friend Dr. Hasselbacher.In seeking to avenge his friend, Jim arranges to have a meeting with Segura, ostensibly to discuss the possible courtship of Milly. Jim must get Segura so drunk that he passes out, so he can steal a loaded gun. As both of them are avid checkers players, he arranges a game of checkers to be played with miniature bottles of liquor. Each time one is captured, it must be opened and drunk immediately. As the captain is in fact a better player, the Captain gets totally, drunk, and Jim takes the gun to kill the would be assassin.Pretending friendship, he has made arrangements to go out on the town with the assassin, using himself as a decoy, assuming that the assassin will use the occasion to have him ambushed and killed by others somewhere. He tells the assassin they will be going to a couple of semi clandestine night clubs, giving their names, but in fact he goes to others, so the ambushers are sent to the wrong place, the assassin is isolated, and Jim shoots him with Seguras gun at the door of a brothel.Captain Segura wakes from his drunken binge unaware of what happened. The next day, however, after Jim and Milly attend Hasselbachers funeral, the captain orders Jim deported, and he must return to London.He tells all details of what he has done to Beatrice, who decides to quit the spy business and return to London with him. Meantime, Beatrice and Milly have become friends, Milly accepts Beatrice as a future stepmother.Accompanied by Beatrice and Milly, Jim goes to a meeting with C and other spy bosses in London. While he is waiting to be seen, the officials discuss what they should do with him. To reveal to the Prime Minister and the other top brass that Jim concocted all his intelligence would have a damaging effect on the intelligence aparatus, so they come up with a solution. A story is fabricated, claiming the hardware that Jim's agent had seen had since been dismantled. Wormold is told he is to receive an O.B.E, and the secret service offers him a position teaching espionage classes to new recruits in London. With this money, he can afford to send Milly to the fancy school in Switzerland."

In Triplicane the next morning, Rajan (Sivaji Ganesan), a radio engineer and communications researcher, is found murdered with his own hand gun. His neighbor Chinnaiah Pillai (P. D. Sambandam) hears the gunshot and complains to the police. A local Police Inspector named Purushothaman Naidu arrives and investigates the scene. He is joined by C.I.D. officer Sivanandam (Javar Seetharaman)there. He concludes that the killer is some petty thief who must have shot Rajan for the lump of money found in the same room of the crime scene. However, Sivanandam states that to be of a bad solution, as the amount of money matches exactly with the withdrawal entry in the bank passbook found in the same room, without a single rupee's difference. Nonetheless, it was clear Rajan was making plans to leave Chennai, in anticipation of the bombings. Rajan's wife Usha (Pandari Bai) is almost dumbstruck and unable to speak during any inquiries. Sivanandam and Naidu feel reluctant and embarrassed to do any questioning to her.The two decide to investigate the case by questioning the people in and around the house, who are the family members or friends of Rajan. They first do their inquiry with Chinnaiah Pillai, the neighbour as he is the first to inform them. He tells that the killer could probably be Pattabi, Rajan's younger brother (T. K. Balachandran). He recounts an incident (as flashback), in which Pattabi confronts Rajan at the house's garage to ask for his share of the family property to be apportioned and given to him. Rajan, in good faith, denies to give Pattabi his share, feeling that he and his wife might squander it. Chinnaiah concludes that this would have kindled Pattabi to kill Rajan.Sivanandam and Naidu decide to inquire Pattabi. However, Pattabi had rushed to the Beach before their arrival, probably to commit suicide. They rush there themselves to inquire him. When questioned, Pattabi feels remorseful of his brother's death. He states that he did treat his brother well when he was alive and did not understand his good intentions. He recounts another incident where his wife Hema, had fought with him herself, during dinner for the apportionment of property herself. She is also a person who loses sanity when overpowered by anger. Pattabi believes of a very good possibility, that Hema used the Rajan's gun to shoot him for the money.Sivanamdam parts to meet Hema soon after, to do his inquiry. Hema was initially impudent and refusing to give her statement of the crime, but later gives in when threatened to be arrested for the same. She reveals a secret of Rajan. Rajan has had extramarital affair with a dancer named Ambujam. She knew this when she once found and overheard Rajan and Ambujam speaking together a week before the murder, where Ambujam unveils that she is pregnant. Rajan treats the news with a reckless attitude, infuriating Ambujam. Hema had received a letter addressed to Rajan from Ambujam, that had the address ""No.15, Thoni Street"". Hema proposes that Ambujam could have killed Rajan in retaliation to Rajan's lack of concern for her.Fatigued with the case's complicated nature, Naidu compares it with a supposed ""Peruvala Vaikal"" in Trichy, a river that has a lot of twists and turns. Sivanandam makes a better analogy of the case, to the story of ""blind men and an elephant"", where each suspect has a different and contrasting opinion to offer. In Thoni Street, Ambujam has made preparations to leave Chennai, at the news of Rajan's death. Half-an-hour after her departure Sivanandam and Naidu arrive there to find the house locked. They take with them Shanmugam, a boy in the street to the Police Station to inquire him on the physical features of Ambujam, to locate and recognize her. The boy knows and has seen her leave from Thoni Street. In a coincidence, Ambujam's bullock-cart and another car strike each other in a road accident, right in front of the very same police station. They identify and inquire Ambujam.Ambujam accuses Chinnaiah (Rajan's neighbour whom they had inquired as the very first suspect) of the murder. She explains that Chinnaiah was her foster father, who wanted her to stay away from Rajan. She started loving after the trio's meeting on a picnic. When their relationship started deepening, Chinnaiah got infuriated and wanted put an end to the affair. Ambujam gives a strong opinion that it must have been Chinnaiah who killed Rajan.Sivanandam does his homework by developing the film roll found in Rajan's camera, collecting and comparing all of the suspects' and others' fingerprints with those found in Rajan's shoes, finding a teardrop mark in Rajan's shoes and finding broken bangle pieces on the crime scene. He finds them further complicating the case and coming nowhere near the conclusion. He gets small clue at a sharbat shop, apparently making no sense. He make inquiries to Rajan's college (Victoria College) principal Ranganathan, who has a high opinion of both Rajan and Usha, his wife, both being his alumni. He says Rajan once broke into the college at night, to complete an experiment, for which he never felt guilty and also Usha once put up the Indian flag as part of Freedom Movement and she accepted doing it herself. This emphasizes her patriotism.Sivanandam inquires finally, Usha. She narrates an incident during college where Rajan spoke of individualistic needs that are equally as important as the country's freedom. He managed to convince the entire crowd of his viewpoint, who previously opined the opposite. However, he was bullied and disdained when Usha took over and changed the crowd back to ""giving your life for the nation"". Usha further tells Sivanandam on how she and Rajan came to love each other. In the process, he tricks into collecting Usha's fingerprints with a leaky fountain pen.On that eve, Sivanandam meets all the suspects along with Naidu at Rajan's residence. He caries our an exercise wherein the suspects including Usha must shoot Sivanandam, assuming that he is Rajan. They are given revolver's with false bullets. Usha is unable to shoot. Then Sivanandam orders an (apparent) arrest of Pattabi and Hema. Unable to bear the torture, Usha comes out with the truth. On the day of the murder when she entered the room she found Rajan working with something meticulously, with a radio equipment, powered by a generator. She doubts of something suspicious. The second time she enters she discovers that he is part of the terrorist activity of bombing Chennai, communicating to the Japanese bombers. He is a key part, of the bombing. Out of her extreme patriotism for her nation, and unable to bear the injustice she tries to talk and mend Rajan's ways. However, Rajan feeling that he should help the Japanese (who helped him with his Radio business), and does not mind betraying his own country. Usha attempts to shoot Rajan whose plan is to escape to Japan in a submarine after the bombing, for which he had packed the money. However, in an accident, fighting for the gun, the trigger is accidentally pressed killing Rajan. She has cried at his boots later, holding them, explaining the fingerprints and teardrop stain.Sivanandam and Naidu ask for the papers Rajan used to hatch the bombing plan. She goes inside to fetch them. Sivanandam tells Naidu that the fingerprints on the boots and hers which he collected, matched, which led him to suspect her. Also, her failure to shoot during the exercise confirms the fact. When Usha takes a long time to come back, the two hear a long silence followed by a gunshot and run inside. Sivanandam shouts ""Usha!"" followed by a screen closing behind them."

tt0177825,['Drama'],"David King (Edwin Richfield) is the heir to Harry King's boatyard at Pin Mill on the River Orwell in Suffolk. He has been a prisoner of war where he made friends with Johnny Craig (Don Sharp) a keen yachtsman from Australia. King has waxed lyrical about the delights of the busy village with its boat yard, sailmakers and pub and its fleets of fishing boats and barges.As the village appears over the hill David is dismayed to see just a few rotting hulks. What has happened?Walking across the mud they come across David's boat Adena. This is the fast fishing boat he designed and built before the war. She is filthy and mastless.Arriving at the hard they meet David's sister Joan (Gwynneth Vaughan), herself recently returned from the Wrens, his mother (Eva Rowland) and kid brother Brian (Terry Everett). As they sit down to dinner on Mrs King's house boat Joan explains that the river has been dredged as far as Ipswich so the lighters don't need to unload their cargo onto barges at Pin Mill any more and the riverbed is foul from wartime obstructions making it impossible to fish. The villagers have taken jobs at factories in Ipswich and Catchpowell the sail maker (Arthur Goullet) is making fertiliser bags.David gets drunk and morose. Johnny and Joan hatch a plot to renovate and convert Adena into a yacht and sell her. If she is successful, maybe other design and build orders will follow.In the morning, Johnny tricks David into having their idea, and they try and get the villagers to help. The villagers are highly critical of yachtsmen as 'parasites' on the backs of working seamen and noone is willing to take the risk of giving their factory jobs up, although they hate them.Johnny, Joan and David try hauling Adena into shallower water. The local parson helps and before long more of the villagers are helping.They get wind of a yacht race to be run from the Orwell to the Cork Lightship. Winning the race will be a great advert for David's boat designing skills. They get more help from the villagers but they still have no sails.The sail maker's wife Florrie (Natalie Raine) tries to persuade her husband to make them some sails in the primary comedy sequence of the movie, with a hilarious lack of success. Mrs King knows of skeletons in Catchpowell's closet and persuades him to cut down an old suite of barge sails for them.On Adena's first trial sail they encounter some lethal looking ironwork in the water, narrowly avoiding disaster and then have a friendly race with another yacht. This turns out to be the pride and joy of Richard Martin (Darcy Conyers), a famous racing yachtsman. Everyone is down-hearted at the prospect of having to race against such a famous adversary.Johnny suggests a wager. If Adena beats Moonshine, David will get to design Richard's next yacht. And if Richard likes the design, it will be built at Pin Mill.As the race day approaches its clear that Adena is a very fast boat and Johnny an outstanding skipper. If its a windy day Adena's sea kindly hull and gaff rig will enable her to carry more canvas than Moonshine's modern lines and bermudan rig. In light airs Moonshine will have the advantage.Johnny's advances towards Joan are also clearly meeting with success.At the race start Johnny puts Adena onto starboard tack forcing Richard to give him water and then takes a huge risk accelerating straight for the start line. It pays off and the gun sounds just as they cross the line. All clear and the race is on.The boats head out towards the Cork Sands. In the Butt and Oyster, the villagers listen to the racing commentary from the lightship via short wave radio. Its a light breeze, Moonshine is first. Adena is fourth. As they round the lightship the breeze picks up but Adena loses control of her topsail and Joan has to go aloft to retrieve the halyard.As they approach the finish line Adena tacks sharply and Joan, working on the foredeck is pushed overboard by the boom of the self-tacking staysail. Johnny dives in to rescue her. David is left on the helm, all hope of winning is gone.Johnny puts a cold, wet but unhurt Joan to bed. He tells her when she moves to Australia with him she'll have to get used to having a sun tan.Back in the pub Richard is celebrating his win. Magnanimous in victory, he says Adena's hull is clearly so fast that he won't have anyone but David design his next boat. Johnny slips away, satisfied that the village is saved, his friend's future secure and he's got the girl."

Steve Martin (Raymond Burr) narrates, ""This is Tokyo, once a city of six million people. What has happened here was caused by a force which up until a few days ago was entirely beyond the scope of mans imagination. Tokyo, a smoldering memorial to the unknown. An unknown, which at this very moment still prevails and could at any time lash out with its terrible destruction anywhere else in the world. There were once many people here who could have told of what they saw. Now, there are only a few."" Martin is pulling himself out from under rubble and tells us, ""My name is Steve Martin. I'm a foreign correspondent for United World News. I was headed for an assignment in Cairo when I stopped off in Tokyo for a social call, but it turned out to be a visit to the living hell of another world."" Bloody and battered, he struggles to get up but faints.Medical workers are carrying stretchers with the injured into makeshift hospitals. Helping in the hospital is Emiko Yamane (Momoko Kochi), daughter of Dr. Yamane, a leading paleontologist. Steve is carried into one of the hospitals on a stretcher. Steve sees Emiko and calls to her. She comes over to talk to the reporter. Steve asks about her father and is told he is fine and meeting with security officials. She departs to find a doctor to attend to Steve. He begins his flashback, ""It was still hard for me to believe that I could be lying here in a hospital alive. When I think of the thousands of others, dead and dying in the ruins around me. When I think back only a few days ago. I was enroute to Cairo, with a few days layover in Tokyo."" Steve was planning to meet with an old college friend, Dr. Serizawa, a theoretical scientist who was gaining great recognition in the Far East for his unusual experiments.A ship at sea is attacked by an unseen menace. It sinks, burning, but not before a radio distress signal is sent. Steve is processing in with Customs when Serizawa's assistant meets him in line to tell him Serizawa is unavailable. Another man, an official, takes Steve to a security office for questioning. The security officer, Tomo Iwanaga (Frank Iwanaga) asks Steve if, during the flight, he noticed anything unusual happen. Steve notes that everyone on the flight is being questioned and wants to know why. Steve presents his reporter's credentials but is told by Iwanaga that he doesn't think the reason should be printed. He does volunteer that a ship was sunk and the crew reported a blinding flash of light and the ocean burst into flames. Steve expresses interest in the story and is invited to a briefing with the ship owners.A rescue ship is sent to investigate, but it is also destroyed. Steve calls his office in Chicago to report that eight ships have been destroyed so far with the same method. He informs his editor he intends to stay and report on the developing story. A few survivors, who were found, died of shock and strange burns. A meeting of security officials and top scientists was called. Dr. Yamane (Takashi Shimura) was invited. Steve had met the scientist through his association with Serizawa. Steve is present at the meeting and Iwanaga translates. Odo Island seems to be close to the disasters, so it is decided the research should start there.On the island, wreckage washes up with a survivor, but he soon dies. The next day a helicopter is sent to Odo Island. Steve managed to get an invite. The officials want to question the natives. Steve and Tomo Iwanaga talk to a native who is very frightened and claims he saw a monster. They spend the night on the island and watch an ancient ceremony that is related to a legend, Godzilla. That evening the wind picks up and they are caught in a typhoon. The next morning officials brought some of the islanders back to the mainland to make a direct report. Each of the natives said a living creature was responsible for the damage. Dr. Yamane proposes a research party should investigate Odo Island. Steve asks Yamana for permission to be included.The ship departs for the island. On board Emiko is talking to a young Marine officer named Ogata (Akira Takarada). Despite her engagement to Serizawa she is very friendly with Ogata. They arrive on the island and begin work. It is noticed that some areas are contaminated with radiation. Yamane notices the large footprints of a living creature and they are also radioactive. He finds a living fossil--a trilobite. A man rings an alarm bell and calls the name Godzilla. They head for the hills. Loud footsteps are heard, then above a mountain ridge the beast appears. Only the head and neck are visible. The beast roars and the islanders and scientists scatter. Emiko falls, but Ogata picks her up and they run for safety. As quickly as it appeared, Godzilla retreats back into the ocean. The crowd runs to the top of the ridge, but all they see are the creatures enormous footprints leading back to the water.Yamane gives his report of the findings on the island. He postulates Godzilla is an intermediary between ancient land and sea creatures. A picture of the creature taken on the island shows it to be 400 feet tall. He blames H-bomb experimentation for the resurrection of the beast. Steve calls his editor, George Lawrence (an uncredited Mikel Conrad) to provide an update. Steve tells George that the military intends to use depth bombs on Godzilla. Steve next calls Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata), who is working in his laboratory. They make a date for dinner the next evening. Serizawa will be meeting with Emiko this evening.Steve explains that Serizawa and Emiko were betrothed when they were both children. Emiko does not love the scientist, but she does have great respect for him. She is working up the courage to tell Serizawa she intends to marry Ogata. Before she can tell him her news, he insists that she witness something in the laboratory. Sarizawa drops a small tablet into a large fish tank. He applies power, and the water begins to churn and boil. Emiko screams at the sight of something happening in the tank. The pair exit the lab, Emiko still visibly upset. Serizawa swears Emiko to secrecy regarding his discovery. She returns to Ogata but tells him nothing.The Japanese Navy drops depth charges into Tokyo Bay. Dr. Yamane, Emiko, and Ogata watch this on television. Yamane is visibly upset and leaves the room. Emiko goes to check on her father. Yamane does not want the creature killed; He wants it studied. A party boat out in Tokyo Bay spots Godzilla surface and panic ensues. The military prepares for an attack. That evening Godzilla surfaces in the bay and is met by military force. It wades ashore and destroys a train station, picking a train carriage up in its mouth. As people scatter from the menace, Steve and Tomo witness the destruction from higher ground. After a brief time, Godzilla returns to the water. The city of Tokyo is surrounded by large electricity transmission towers carrying 300,000 volts. They hope that will keep the creature out of the city. Non-essential personnel are evacuated from the city. The newspaper office is high up in a building and allows a good view of the city. Steve uses a tape recorder for his observations. That evening Godzilla again walks out of Tokyo Bay. He walks through the high voltage lines, then destroys a few of the towers. Godzilla's hot breath melts the surrounding transmission towers. They glow red hot, then soften and collapse. Again, using its hot breath, sections of the city are engulfed in flames. The creature is impervious to tank fire. Fleeing people are either burned or crushed under foot by the rampaging beast. The newspaper building is destroyed with Steve still reporting from inside. Leaving the city in flames, Godzilla returns to Tokyo Bay. Fighter Jets launch missiles at the creature, but they also have no effect.Steve wakes in the hospital surrounded by Emiko and Ogata. She tells Steve about the terrible weapon Serizawa has invented. Emiko recounts her visit to the lab and provides details about the oxygen destroyer and the terrible effect it had on the fish. The weapon dissolves the flesh from anything it touches.Emiko and Ogata go to see Serizawa at his home. Ogata confronts Serizawa and demands that the discovery be used on Godzilla. Serizawa refuses and he and Ogata scuffle over the formula and papers in the laboratory. Serizawa is concerned his terrible weapon may fall into the wrong hands. To assure himself it won't be misused or stolen, Serizawa destroys all his notes and insists he personally deploy the weapon.Serizawa and Ogata dive into Tokyo Bay to place the weapon to destroy Godzilla. They find the creature prowling around and walk closer. They place the weapon and Ogata surfaces, but Serizawa remains behind and deploys the weapon. Godzilla writhes in pain as the chemical strips his flesh away. Serizawa reports the weapon is working, and then he cuts his line to the surface. Godzilla briefly surfaces and bellows his defeat, then sinks and is devoured by the chemical leaving only his skeleton.We close with a scene of the ocean at sunset and Steve Martin reporting, ""The menace was gone; so was a great man. But the whole world could wake up and live again."""

The hotel' car only takes Azmi so far, and then Dracula's own carriage picks him up. The Count himself, incognito, drives the carriage to the castle. At the castle, Azmi is greeted by the Count, who helps Azmi with his bags and shows him to his room.

Dracula tells Azmi about Transylvanian history. Wolves howl outside, and the Count remarks: ""Listen to them-the children of the night!

Before Ann can finish hiding the key Walshaw comes in and takes it and asks them some serious questions about Robert again.That evening Chris and Ann talk again.

She rushes to Chris in the living room and wakens him. They notice half the arsenic is missing and a boot print on a chair.

This motto of Narsi Mehta was remembered in morning prayers of Mahatma Gandhi and his followers. After 500 years, the spirit of Narsi Mehta was re-born in Mahatma Gandhi. . Narsi was a poor mute boy, born in Brahmin family of Junagadh (Saurashtra) in 15th Century. From very childhood he had great leaning towards Sadhus and was fond of attending Kirtans. Once he came in contact of a saint, and by the blessing of the saint Narsi obtained the power of speech- and thus from the childhood, he become great devotee of God. . Narsis grand mother and elder brother were not in favour of his assoiciation with Sadhus and his learning towards Bhakti, therefore they arranged his marriage with Manik Mehti, and after some years Narsi became the father of son and a daughter. But during all these years Narsis inclination towards Bhakti was unchanged.

Narsi Mehta who was a great devotee, and for whose honour God performed miracles on the occasions of his grand mothers death ceremony ( Sharadh- Tehri) and Mamera (Bhat) of his grand daughtes marriage; was a believer in equality of rights for every human being. He could not see merciless and inhuman treatment of priests and Brahmins towards Untouchables. He opposed vehemantly the cast order and rude behaviour of high placed people of the society. Sarandhar all the while was instigating the citizens and was gathering hooligans against him. Thus Narsi became the torch-bearer of social revolution. . Mandlik-the king of Junagadh-called Narsi in his court and asked him to sing Kedar Raag. Narsi could not do so, as he had mortgaged the same with some one. Mandlik ordered his imprisonment and a miracle took place. Sarangdhar represented to the King that Narsi has obtained black powers and it is he who has done this......However, God Almighty came to the rescue of his great devotee, and Narsi was able to establish himself as the True Devoteee of God."

tt0238575,['Drama'],"S√°ngtye Aik√° (""I'll tell you, listen!"") is the fictional story of a tyrant named Mah√°dev (D√°d√° S√°l.v√≠), the rich landowner (p√°t.√≠l) of R√°jur√≠ village in Mah√°r√°sht.ra, India, and how his exploitation of poor and honest men and women ultimately backfires. The tragic events of the story are punctuated by songs with significant meanings, mostly romantic compositions (l√°van.√≠) performed by the itinerant tam√°sh√° troupe of a woman named Chim√° Kad.laskar√≠n. (Hams√° V√°d.kar), which make the movie itself resemble a melodrama (vag).The movie opens with a traditional invocation of Gan.esha, the God who removes obstacles: ""Come quickly, Gan.esha the Accomplished. The essence is a sermon, with a veneer of tam√°sh√°."" After Chim√° performs a milkmaid song (gavl.an.) in which Chandr√°val., the milkmaid, rebuffs the cowherd God Krishna's blandishments but quickly falls under the spell of his flute, Mah√°dev tosses a silver coin onto the stage and demands a certain l√°van.√≠ song-and-dance. Chim√° refuses the coin, and also his paper money, and when he takes the silver bangle off his wrist to give her, she kicks it away and reminds him that eight years ago, he had her father (a low-caste mah√°r labourer) assassinated for refusing to give false testimony. As Mah√°dev moves to choke her, he is prevented by a young farmer named Sakh√°r√°m Shinde (Chandrak√°nt M√°ndre). When Mah√°dev mocks him, ""You act like someone laid a hand on your sister!"" Sakh√°r√°m's retort, ""If not my sister, she's still a woman!"" foreshadows the moral of the movie. Sakh√°r√°m also tells Mah√°dev that the silver bangle is a trophy from the annual bullock-cart race, and must go to the next year's winner. To Mah√°dev's indignation, Sakh√°r√°m even wagers to win the next race.Mah√°dev storms off to his mansion, where his servant R√°mj√≠ (Vasant Shinde) assures him that his bullocks are the best in the village. After his saintly wife J√°nak√≠ (Ratnam√°l√°) urges him to pardon the offences of a hard-working, honest man like Sakh√°r√°m, Mah√°dev goes to sleep next to his beloved son Kisn√° (√Åhl√°d). At dawn, in Sakh√°r√°m's rustic homestead, his beautiful wife Hams√° (Sulochan√°) awakens him with a reveille (bh√∫p√°l.√≠) that conveys her longing for a child, and tells him not to pick fights with rich people.Mah√°dev finds Sakh√°r√°m prying the wheel of his bullock-cart out of the mud, and mocks him, but Sakh√°r√°m's cart quickly overtakes his. Apprehensive that he will lose face at the annual race, Mah√°dev invites Sakh√°r√°m and Hams√° to celebrate the birth-festival of the God Krishna at his house, at which time he instructs the low-caste dacoit S√°vl.y√° R√°mosh√≠ (Vasant Pahelv√°n) to set fire to their homestead. Sakh√°r√°m rushes into the flames to save his bullocks, and Mah√°dev, pretending to attempt to drag him away, ensures that Sakh√°r√°m perishes. He then takes the destitute widow Hams√° to his mansion as a companion for J√°nak√≠. When S√°vl.y√° shows up to collect his payment from Mah√°dev, the cunning landowner gives him money and jewelry from the safe, then accuses him of robbery and arson and has him arrested. S√°vl.y√° swears revenge.At a private party in another village, Chim√° sings a l√°van.√≠ about a lonely farmer-wife terrified that the bird tapping on her window is a rapist trying to get in. A patron apprises her of Sakh√°r√°m's death, which she intuitively attributes to Mah√°dev.While J√°nak√≠ and Kisn√° are at her brother's home for the Gaur√≠ festival, Mah√°dev becomes enamoured of Hams√° and pretends to be stung by a scorpion so that he can grab her. Hams√° escapes, and muses to R√°mj√≠ that it must have been a female scorpion, minding her own business when Mah√°dev stepped on her. ""They say that a male scorpion stings a man who has committed his hundredth sin; a female scorpion waits for the hundred-and-fifth."" When Mah√°dev hears of this, he sends the servants to keep watch at night, leaving Hams√° at his mercy. As J√°nak√≠ leads the women at the festival in the song of how the demon king R√°van.a lured the Goddess S√≠t√° out of her hut with a golden deer, Hams√° tries to flee the mansion, but Mah√°dev corners her and rapes her. On her way home, J√°nak√≠ crosses paths with Hams√°, who is in a fugue state, and confronts Mah√°dev about the rape, but he easily subdues her.Meanwhile, S√°vl.y√° has escaped from prison and visits Chim√°, who has known him since childhood. He plans a raid of Mah√°dev's mansion and, following dacoit tradition, announces it beforehand by hurling a vermilion-smeared rock through the window. S√°vl.y√° narrowly avoids a police ambush when he finds Hams√° drowning, and retreats to his hideout with her. Full of remorse for his crimes against her, he adopts her as his sister and swears vengeance for the rape, but on his way to murder Mah√°dev, he gets shot and rolls into a ravine.There is a comic-relief duet in which R√°mj√≠, tired of Mah√°dev's empty promises to intercede in his marital rift, himself convinces his wife S√°l.√∫ (choreographer L√≠l√° G√°ndh√≠) to reconcile with him. Nine months go by as S√°vl.y√° hides out, nursing his injured leg and caring for Hams√° until she gives birth to a girl and dies. The funeral pyre attracts the police. On the run, S√°vl.y√° entrusts the baby to Chim√°, who names her Hams√°. Hams√° grows up before Chim√°'s eyes and becomes a proficient tam√°sh√° dancer (Jayashr√≠ Gad.kar) by the age of fifteen.The year is 1936 or shortly thereafter (as a poster advertising the movie Sant Tuk√°r√°m indicates). Mah√°dev and J√°nak√≠'s son Kisn√° (S√∫ryak√°nt M√°ndre) has grown up and married, but he neglects his wife (N√≠lam Bel.g√°vkar) to attend tam√°sh√° performances in a nearby village. After Hams√° performs a l√°van.√≠ about a girl who sneaked out of her house at night on horseback, dressed as a man, to meet her lover, Kisn√° tries to make her acquaintance, but has to leave when his father arrives. Chim√° accosts Mah√°dev, ""You cannot escape from the snare set by Destiny. Look at this girl carefully. Do you recognize her? She's yours! As to where and how, ask your conscience. Have you figured it out? It's the bulge in Hams√°'s belly - Hams√°!""Confronted with the scandal that his daughter is in a tam√°sh√° troupe and Kisn√° is visiting her, Mah√°dev has a nightmare about his mansion going up in flames. J√°nak√≠ reassures him that no one would set fire to their house because they haven't wronged anyone. Once again, Kisn√° has gone to the tam√°sh√°, where Hams√° is performing the l√°van.√≠ ""Oh no! I've lost my eartop on the way to S√°t√°r√°. Don't anyone tell my old man about my little mistake."" Mah√°dev follows him, frantic with worry that Chim√° has allowed his own daughter to seduce his son. The next day, he sends Kisn√° to market with R√°mj√≠, telling him to be back at sundown, but Kisn√° finds Chim√° and Hams√° on the road and visits their camp at night.Even as Hams√° is telling Chim√° that she won't sell herself to a married man like Kisn√°, Kisn√° arrives and Hams√° engages him in a game of question-and-answer (sav√°l-jab√°b). Hams√°: ""Why does a young man remember love when he sees the moon?"" Kisn√°: ""When the moon appears, breaker waves rise from the ocean. Poets know this as the great display of love."" Hams√°: ""The waves are the ocean's daughters; only madmen think that they are in love with their brother, the moon!"" Kisn√°: ""What makes the moon the brother of the waves? Show me proof!"" Hams√°: ""In the olden days, the spirits of good and evil churned the ocean, and the jewel called the moon was born. From the same ocean spring the dark waves. What is their relationship but that of sister and brother?"" Kisn√° offers Hams√° money, but she tells him to buy his wife a bracelet ""from her sister-in-law"" instead.Mah√°dev demands to know whether Kisn√° has ""earned his wife's curse"" and is relieved when Kisn√° protests his innocence. He begs Chim√° to take the girl and go away to preserve his honour in his old age, but she spits at his money and tells him that he doesn't deserve to die in peace. ""You're afraid of your own shame, but had no fear when you shamed women. Coward! Get out of my house!"" Chim√° vows to shame Mah√°dev in his own village by showing off his daughter with bells on her feet. She returns to the stage with Hams√° to narrate a melodrama (vag) entitled, ""The Landowner's Daughter."" It is the full story of Mah√°dev's crimes against Sakh√°r√°m, S√°vl.y√°, and Hams√° (Sr.). When Hams√° (Jr.) hears it, she realizes that her namesake's tragedy was her own nativity. As Chim√° laments that pious Hams√°'s daughter has become a working girl, and exposes Kisn√°'s passion for his sister Hams√°, Mah√°dev confronts her with a loaded rifle. As he is about to shoot her, S√°vl.y√° challenges him, and Mah√°dev shoots him, just as S√°vl.y√° hurls an axe into his chest. Mah√°dev accepts his death, seeking J√°nak√≠'s forgiveness and asking Kisn√° to look after her, and S√°vl.y√° dies rejoicing that he did one good deed by taking vengeance as he promised Hams√°'s mother.The movie's last scene shows Hams√° in the role of a sister to Kisn√°, tying a protective silver amulet (r√°kh√≠) on his wrist. ""In the olden days, the spirits of good and evil churned the ocean, and the jewel called the moon was born. From the same ocean spring the dark waves.

tt0247919,[],"This story, passed on through centuries through traditional verse and folklore, dates back to the early 12th century during the reign of Kulothunga Chola I. The movie version of the story is this: Kambar, the kavichakravarthi whose name in enshrined forever as the author of Ramavatharam, the Tamil version of Ramayana, is a poet in Kulothungas court in Urayur. Despite his erudite scholarship, deep learning of Sanskrit and Tamil and extraordinary poetic skills, Kamban remains a humble, unassuming, deeply pious man, and a loyal subject of the King. All this earns Kamban a special place in the heart of Kulothunga who treats him with utmost deference and affection. Ottakoothar is another great poet in the Kings court, and Kambans ascent in the firmament and the Kings unabashed admiration for Kambans poetry has Ottakoothar simmering in jealousy.It is in this backdrop that the love story blossoms. Amaravathi, the beautiful princess and Ambikapathy, the handsome and talented son of Kambar, fall in love. Ambikapathy is a bold, assertive and supremely self-confident youth, who even at that age, exhibits poetic skills equal to that of his illustrious father. Ottakoothar is doubly dismayed when he hears of this affair, for he had planned to bring about the marriage of Amaravathi with his stooge, Prince Kulasekharan of Vengi. With a brilliant, cunning mind at work, Ottakoothar sets about poisoning the Kings mind against Ambikapathi and contrives to bring about various situations wherein Ambikapathi might fall to disgrace. Luck seems to be on Ambikapathis side as he comes unscathed through these traps.However, when Kamban discovers his sons love for the princess and realizes the gruesome retribution that would undoubtedly follow, he pleads with Ambikapathi to give up his love. Meanwhile, Ottakoothar gets possession of a verse that Ambikapathi had penned as an ode to Amaravathis beauty and loses no time to showing the parchment to the King. The King is shaken by this clinching evidence of the love affair, and is determined to put it to an end. However, wishing to avoid any unwanted publicity and not willing to take any drastic measures, at the suggestion of Kamban, the King orders Ambikapathi to go to the distant Pushpaga Theevu, apparently to propagate the greatness of Tamil. A storm leads to the ship in which Ambikapathy is traveling being wrecked; and hanging on to a log, Ambikapathi is washed ashore in Shenbaga Theevu. Coming to know of the developments in Uraiyur, Ambikapathy hastens in disguise thereto.With the help of Kannamma, the daughter of Pugazhendhi Pulavar, he succeeds in meeting Amaravathi, and they plan to flee to Shenbaga Theevu that night. But their plans go awry and both are caught trying to leave the palace. The King sentences Ambikapathy to death. But Amaravathi intervenes, claiming equal responsibility for whatever may have been the crime that Ambikapathi is said to have committed. In the ensuing argument, the King condemns Ambikapathi as sham poet who could write only verses that cater to mans baser instincts. Ambikapathy is outraged at this slur on his poetic capabilities. The upshot is that if Ambikapathi could sing 100 devotional songs in succession, the King promises him Amaravathis hand in marriage. If he failed in this challenge, he would be executed forthwith. Amaravathi visits Ambikapathi in prison that night and urges caution. Ambikapathi laughs away her fears, assuring her that he is wholly confident of his own capabilities. A relieved Amaravathi says that she would be counting the songs, and would appear before him at the end of the ordeal.The court assembles next day at the vasantha madapam, and in the august presence of the King, ministers and scholars, Ambikapathy commences his soiree with a short invocation to Saraswathi, the Goddess of learning. Amaravathi mistakenly counts this as one of the hundred songs, and so at the end of the 99th song, she appears happily in front of Ambikapathi to signal his victory. Overjoyed at sighting his beloved, and thinking that he has completed the hundred songs, Ambikapathy bursts into a verse in praise of Amaravathis appearance. Rising with grim satisfaction, Ottakoothar points out that only 99 devotional songs had been sung, and hence Ambikapathy has lost the challenge. Kambans anguish-filled plea for clemency falls on deaf ears, as the King orders the death sentence to be carried out. Ambikapathi is put to death, and the grief-stricken Amaravathi too falls dead their souls unite in heaven."

Pillai justifies his act, saying that he instructed his men to do it due to the famine conditions prevalent in their kingdom. Ashamed of Pillai's act, Kattabomman accuses him of injustice. Pillai apologises and offers himself as a prisoner to the British, but Kattabomman refuses to hand Pillai over; instead he offers money to the British as compensation for the looted rice. Ooshington does not agree and, with Major Bannerman's (Javar Seetharaman) and Ettappan's help, instigates the neighbouring rulers to attack Kattabomman. Bannerman is placed in charge of the British troops. He and Ettappan plan to attack Panchalankurichi when the people are away attending a festival in Tiruchendur. Kattabomman's spy Sunderalingam (A. Karunanidhi), overhears this and informs Kattabomman, who prepares for battle.On the day of the battle, Vellaiyammal pleads Vellaiyathevan not to go because the previous night she had a nightmare, which was full of evil omens. Ignoring her entreaties, Vellaiyathevan sets out, and is killed in the ensuing battle. Vellaiyammal, on learning of his death, kills the man who killed him, avenging her husband's death. She finds Vellaiyathevan's corpse and, out of grief, falls dead on it. Bannerman's troops attack Panchalankurichi with heavy artillery and Kattabomman's army suffers badly. Kattabomman is wounded in the neck, but is saved by his brother, Oomaithurai (O. A. K. Thevar). Sensing that the fort cannot survive another cannon barrage, Kattabomman and Oomaithurai flee to the adjoining kingdom of Kovilpatti. Pillai, disguising himself as Kattabomman, misleads the British soldiers who are on the trail of Kattabomman. From Kovilpatti, Kattabomman and Oomaithurai then flee to Pudukkottai. Thondaimaan, the king of Pudukkottai, is ordered by the British to capture Kattabomman and Oomaithurai. In fear of the British, Thondaimaan captures the two and hands them over. While Oomaithurai is jailed, Kattabomman faces a summary trial by the British and is hanged from a Tamarind tree at Kayatharu."

tt0324502,[],"An older Japanese sailor is leaving the Kamagme Caf√©, heading back to his ship; when he hears a tune whistled and he starts to panic, and run. He does not escape though and is stabbed in the back with an ornamental knife. The next day, a cargo ship captained by Onizame (Hiroshi Nihon'yanagi) is nearly ready to cast off, but they are waiting for the first mate, Goro Kiezo (Hiroyuki Nagato) to arrive. He is being interrogated by the police about the death of his father, and arrives after two men, both claiming to have been sent by the union hall have been met on board by the bosun Matsu (Senkichi), and started to fight. The younger is Senkichi Namura (Y√ªjir√¥ Ishihara), and the older one is Sasaki (Rentar√¥ Mikuni), who fights the younger man to a standoff, before the fight is broken up by Goro. The Captain has been impatient to leave, telling his second mate that he has lost his closest friend Sanzo, who was the chief engineer and Goro's father. Noticing the first mate is back, Onizame tells Goro to allow both men to stay on board as they shove off for Hong Kong. When he returns to his cabin after he turns over the helm to the second mate, he discovers his teen aged daughter Akiko (Ruriko Asaoka) is still on board, and then tells Goro to watch her and keep her from harm with the crew. Akiko tries to comfort Goro, saying that Sanzo was like an uncle to her. Going into his father's cabin, Goro discovers the knife that he thought was used to kill his father, and soon thereafter he notices another like it in the drawer of the Captain, which he brings to Onizame's attention. As the ship leaves the harbor, Senkichi catches Akiko's eye, and comments to the girl that the sea is calm now, before the storm, but Sasaki is clearly bothered that the captain has such an innocent daughter. The ship's drunk Hikobei (K√¥ Nishimura), is eager to get into the shipment of liquor in the hold, and sailor Oyaji is annoyed by the arrogance of the young newcomer Senkichi. They get into a fight below deck, and when Oyaji pulls a knife, and corners the young newcomer, Sasaki manages to break it up by shoving a table between them and restraining Senkichi, while the others restrain the knife holder. The cook, Tatsu (Tomio Aoki), notices some food missing and calls in the crew when he finds a dirty young woman in his pantry. They bring her up on deck and wash her down under Matsu's orders, and discover Akemi (Yumeji Tsukioka), a brazen young woman who has followed Senkichi aboard. Senkichi tells her that he wants nothing to do with her, but she now is adopted by the crew, even though some, including Oyaji try to get her alone to assault her. Seeing this Tatsu calls on Senkichi to help, and he sets the older sailor in his place. Eventually Akemi befriends the young sailor Ken who is mourning the infidelity of his girl on shore, and nurses the lad back to health when he gets sick by staying on deck during a storm. But she treats the lad as a younger brother, and still pines for the brash Senkichi. When Captain Onizame learns the last name of Senkichi, he is alarmed, and tells Goro that he believes that Namura may have killed his father. Goro gets Senkichi alone on deck, and asks the young man if he was responsible for Sanzo's death. When Senkichi tells Goro, about the theft of his father by Sanzo and Captain Onizame who stole the ship from the three way partnership, Goro lets the matter drop. The crew are spooked when one of the life boats is missing, and later when Senkichi is nearly killed by a falling pulley on the main deck, saved only by the quick thinking of Sasaki. They also start to suspect that something is not right, when many of the bottles of liquor that they steal from the cargo are filled with water. Akiko is attracted to the deck by a song being whistled, and finds Senkichi on deck. He teaches her the tune, which further spooks Captain Onizame when he hears it, then the next night Senkichi teaches her the words, playing a ukulele. Upset when he learns that his daughter is attracted to Senkichi, Onizame challenges the young man to a fight, but for a third time Sasaki intercedes. Now Onizame is sure that Senkichi is Sanzo's killer, who now is using Akiko to get at himself. Senkichi has started to suspect that Sasaki is a cop. He gets Akemi to come on to the older man to get information, but uses their deck side encounter to go through Sasaki's bag, where he finds a pair of hand cuffs. Meanwhile, mistaking the taciturn Sasaki for a fellow criminal on the run, the bosun Matsu tells Sasaki that he has been on sea for nearly 30 years, since he killed his wife for cheating on him, and that he will finally be a free man when they reach Hong Kong, after the 30 year statute of limitations expires. The radio is damaged, just before a major storm, and the crew is getting restless, particularly when the discover that most of the cargo is not cement, but sand, and not liquor, but water, and that there is dynamite in the hold. They are incited to action when Sasaki tells them of another ship that was scuttled by the officers, with almost all the crew lost, after the radio and life boats were destroyed. But the police were able to thwart the insurance scam and arrest the culprits based on the one surviving crew member who managed to make it to shore. As the storm comes up, the crew are confronting the captain, when the anchor gets loose and starts to hit eh side of the boat. The second mate, who had been instructed to blow the ship, is washed overboard, and the first mate, ties himself to both Senkichi and Sasaki and the deck to get the old ratchet working again. But both Goro and Sasaki are washed overboard, still strapped to Senkichi, who manages to hold them close to the ship until they can climb back on board. The three then get the motor of the ratchet working again and bring the anchor aboard. but in the storm another fixture on the ship collapses onto the Captain, and he is buried at sea. Now having saved both Goro and Sasaki, Senkichi feels less indebted to them , but he still has to find a way to tell the grieving Akiko that he cannot be her partner. He reassures her that her father was a good man, unlike himself. Then he tells the girl that he is leaving to open a seaside cafe with Akemi, and that she should consider Goro again. When they reach the dock, Ken is clearly distressed that Akemi, is leaving with Senkichi, and reenlists, Matsu has learned from overhearing a conversation between Senkichi and Sasaki, that Sasaki is a cop, so he tries to avoid his confessor. Sasaki questions Goro about the insurance scam, which he only discovered after boarding the ship, and tells the first mate to report it. He then addresses Matsu confidentially, telling the bosun that he will not press charges. Finally Sasaki leaves the ship on a harbor tug with Senkichi and Akemi, telling the younger man to take a day to have dinner and a night on the town before looking him up to turn himself in. This is a textured film, with a number of interesting well told story lines and characters, where even the enemies have a grudging respect for each other."

tt0371564,[],"An interesting, if occasionally slow and overtly polemical adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's beloved American classic, filmed and set in Iran the year after the CIA-led deposition of liberal president Mossadeq. The necessary updating of the Civil War setting to modern-day Iran requires that we see the incoming Shah Pahlavi and his family as the rapacious Yankees and carpetbaggers, while the noble, tradition-revering Southerners become a diverse group of liberal progressives incensed by US interference and much given to stomping on the Stars and Stripes and burning effigies of Marilyn Monroe and Mickey Rooney in the streets of Tehran. Sarfitta Oharakiri, a spoiled young Persian princess, is bored by the coup and more interested in getting handsome dreamy Ashkaban to marry her... but he is pledged to his cousin, the simple and good Melamoodi, so Sarfitta runs away to Tehran where she scandalizes the good townsfolk by giving them the first demonstration of the hand-jive they have ever seen, at a fundraiser for the Ayatollah. She also consorts with Reza Batlari, a sexy if unscrupulous horse trader from Saudi Arabia who is suspected of collaboration with the Shah. Years pass, people die and Sarfitta opens an opium den in the heart of the souk which makes her incredibly rich - mostly because she gets American secret service agents addicted to the hookah. When the Shah's forces crack down on the Tehranis, Ashkaban falls to pieces, Melamoodhi dies in a suicide bombing and Reza walks out on Sarfitta, telling her ""My dear, I don't give a damn. Alu Akbar!"" Sarfitta, weeping through her chador decides to return to her ancestral goat shack, Tararizm, declaring that tomorrow is another day.Several elements of the original story are missing (such as the slaves, although these ordinary 1950s Iranians sure do have a lot of English au-pairs in the story) and the decision to tell much of the story in elaborate music-and-dance sequences tends to confuse the action, the more so because the lyrics are apparently impossible to translate. There's also rather a lot of gun and rifle brandishing and enthusiastic beating of women, all of whom become more and more difficult to identify as the Tehranis enthusiastically embrace the veil; the fundraising ball, for instance, resembles feeding time at the Penguin House, or one of the weirder sequences in Eyes Wide Shut. Nevertheless, Sarfitta and her faithful au pair Mandy are beautifully played, even if Sarfitta smacks her rather a lot for no apparent reason while ululating shrilly and invoking Allah."
