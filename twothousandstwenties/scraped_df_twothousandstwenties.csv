She reunites with her blockmates in Block Z: fellow med students and longtime friends Erika and Myles, and Block Z basketball team captain Lucas, who harbors feelings for PJ. Mario accidentally hits a pedestrian who secretly intended to scam him of money, but Mario instead brings the man to San Lazaro's hospital, where he meets with PJ again.PJ and Erika are assigned to take care of Angie, a mother who has what appears to be a human bite in her leg. Angie suddenly has a seizure and dies shortly after, and PJ goes to comfort Angie's young daughter Ruby over her mother's death. Myles and fellow student Gary head over to bring Angie's body to the morgue, but Angie reanimates and bites Gary's neck, causing Myles to flee. Angie begins attacking other people in the hospital, causing others to be infected and reanimate as undead, forcing Mario and the pedestrian to flee together. The undead begins slaughtering several students and personnel around the university, including Lucas' team where he emerges as the only survivor. Lucas meets Mario and the pedestrian, but the latter had been bitten and turned, forcing the two to kill him. The two then separate, with both intending to find PJ. Student council president Gelo calls his general father for evacuation via helicopter on the hospital's helipad and tells his vice president Vanessa not to tell anyone as he only informed his father to make room for the two of them. Despite this, Vanessa secretly informs the university councilors to spread the word. Lucas manages to find PJ with Erika and Myles and the four work together to flee the school. The military quarantines the university, but they are forced to kill both zombies and students fleeing from the front gate.Gelo confronts Vanessa for telling the university body about his helicopter, and Vanessa chastises him for looking out for himself when he has the resources to help everyone. They scuffle and Gelo accidentally pushes Vanessa off a staircase, killing her; when PJ's group stumbles upon the scene, Gelo lies and says she was infected and had to take her out in self-defense, and he joins the group. The group plans their route to the hospital, but when they become overwhelmed with zombies, they are rescued by Mario in the school's church. Mario has managed to hole up in the church with Ruby and security guard Bebeth. Gelo reveals that people have to be left behind as his helicopter can only fit two people, which angers the others in the process before the group convinces him that he needs them to survive.The group passes by the faculty next, but when Ruby sees her zombified mother, she rushes to her and alerts the herd to their location. Ruby is devoured in the process, and the others are forced to leave when Gelo goes to the faculty and locks them out. The group temporarily rests in the dormitory, where they reminisce on their past and PJ and Mario reconcile, but a zombie attacks and bites Mario before it is killed. Mario tells the group to kill him to prevent him from turning, but the group opts to lock him inside the dorm's closet, and he says his final goodbyes to PJ before they leave him. Although the group manages to discover the zombies' weaknesses to headshots and water, their numbers begin dwindling: Myles is mortally wounded by a stray zombie and makes a last stand before he is killed, Bebeth stays behind fending off zombies from the others, and Erika sacrifices herself to let PJ and Lucas escape. The two manage to reach the hospital's rooftop, where Lucas lifts PJ to the helipad before using himself as bait to lure zombies away by jumping off the building.A sorrowful PJ loses consciousness and awakens the next day with no helicopter in sight. She sees that she has a bite mark in her hand and realizes that she is immune to the virus, so she fights her way back to the dorms, killing several zombies including Angie in the process. PJ reunites with Mario, who is also immune, and the two decide to explore an ancient tunnel underneath the church that Ruby had previously discovered. There, they encounter Gelo, who is delirious from being infected and jaded from being seemingly abandoned by his father. The two manage to evade him and escape through a manhole and leave Gelo to be devoured by approaching zombies. PJ and Mario realize that the infection has spread beyond the university into the wider city, and they arm themselves.News reports begin sharing the zombie's vulnerability to water. Bebeth broadcasts a message that she had survived. A large typhoon engulfs the Philippines, weakening and killing many of the undead in the process.

tt11390102,['Documentary'],"Vivos is a documentary feature film by artist and filmmaker Ai Weiwei, portraying the human impact of Mexico's ongoing crisis of enforced disappearances.
On the night of September 26, 2014, a convoy of students from Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College in drug cartel-afflicted Guerrero state, travelling in buses in the city of Iguala, were brutally attacked by police forces and other masked assailants. In the course of the night, six people were killed, dozens more were wounded, and 43 students were forcibly disappeared.
Featuring interviews with family members and surviving classmates, as well as human rights experts and international investigators involved with the case, Vivos depicts the emotional impasse the families experience. As they face the still unaccounted-for absence of their loved ones, their family lives irrevocably fractured, the pain of their loss is compounded by the investigating authorities' repeated attempts to mislead and to obstruct the official investigation.
The latest of Ai Weiwei's films highlighting issues of systemic injustice, Vivos documents the aspirations, communal solidarity, and day-to-day lives of the grief- stricken but determined families, as they demand the authorities provide answers about the crimes committed that night and disclose the whereabouts of the missing students.
United behind the rallying cry, 'Alive, they took them! Alive, we want them back!', the families' tragic but defiant struggle embodies the psychological and emotional toll of endemic violence on Mexican society, where disappearances have become a national crisis, with over 40,000 persons officially missing as of 2018. Wrestling with the gross abuses of institutional power that pervade Mexican society, with its staggering contrasts of power and poverty, and the crimes and impunities that permeate public life, the mass demonstrations led by the families of the missing 43 students blossom as a defiant assertion of life."

But his dreams are repeatedly swept away in the tumultuous tides of serial totalitarian occupation of his home.He becomes the lens through which we perceive the relentless and increasingly absurd march of this brief but momentous period in history from a Latvian dictatorship to Soviet occupation to Nazi conquest to the ultimate Soviet return. Ansis struggles to remain neutral and unobtrusive with each new regime, but it is difficult to resist the shifting, opposing forces of resistance and conformity and somehow remain true to himself.
Similarly, Ansis tries not to be dissuaded by Zisla's fascination with communist ideals, nor by her father's forbidding of their union. But as these pressures mount, a young Latvian beauty (NAIGA) arrives on the scene and offers a less complicated path toward a seemingly more predictable future.But soon, Zisla disappears - perhaps to join the communists - and Ansis and Naiga marry. Almost immediately, though, their relationship is put under greater pressure with the Soviet occupation and the shocking arrival of Zisla, now a communist official. Under this brutal regime, huge numbers of their friends and neighbors are sent to almost certain death in Siberia. Meanwhile, Naiga's father is tortured and killed by the Soviets, and Naiga can't help blaming Zisla for his death.When the tides shift again and the Soviets are ousted by the Nazis. Now it is the Jewish people who are targeted, along with the communists, and Ansis finds himself in the darkly absurd position of painting a new sign declaring the region 'Free of Jews.' In this climate, Zisla finds herself on the run, and Ansis insists on hiding her in their attic, against Naiga's strenuous objections, further stressing this deeply fraught relationship.Once again Ansis finds himself in the middle, faced with a choice literally between life and death. As stability crumbles and violence accelerates, Ansis begins to believe that to simply survive may be the only act of heroism that counts."

One day Ayaan told Sikandar about a tournament going to held after 6 months in which the greatest warriors (even from outside of Subhangarh) will participate and the one who wins the competition will become the commander in chief of Subhangarh. They participate in the competition and eventually Ayaan beats Sikandar in the final round. Madhavaditya came and congratulated Ayaan for winning the competition. As he was going to announce the name of Ayaan as the new commander in chief, a minister informs Madhavaditya that Ayaan belongs to a small caste. This enrages king Madhavaditya as it was against his principles that a person from a small caste participates in a tournament of greatest warriors. He barely keeps himself from punishing Ayaan and eventually offers him to become an ordinary soldier of Subhangarh, to which Ayaan agrees. Then Madhavaditya declares Sikandar as the new commander in chief. Everyone bows to Sikandar.
After that Subhangarh faces many wars against outsiders and wins against them because of the presence of two of the great warriors, Ayaan and Sikandar. Though Ayaan doesn't get any attention and reputation since he was just a mere soldier. On the other hand, Sikandar was credited as the greatest warrior of all the time by the crowd of Subhangarh.
The growing popularity of Sikandar even attracts princess Vaidehi towards him. As they grew close to each other, Ayaan understands that he has lost his everything including reputation, his childhood friend Sikandar and his true love Vaidehi, just because he belongs to a small caste. He accepts his fate though.
Madhavaditya announced the marriage of Vaidehi with Bheema, the highest official of Subhangarh and the cousin brother of prime minister Nardev. Bheema was considered as the most intelligent member from the entire royal family of Subhangrah. Both Sikandar and Vaidehi were unhappy with this marriage and Ayaan felt the pain of both of them and decided to do something.
The story comes back to the current time (after the fly scene). Few days later, Vaidehi writes a letter to someone. She then calls upon a random soldier which turns out to be Ayaan only and asked him to deliver this letter to Sikandar. He agrees and took the letter from her. After moving few steps, he realizes that Sikandar had went to the forest with king Madhavaditya for hunting. So, Ayaan moves towards the forest too.
While on the way, he crashes with another soldier who was also taking a letter for someone. Their letters were exchanged. Ayaan instantly realizes this, and he was about to call the soldier that their letters are exchanged. But suddenly he sees that letter has a sign of rival enemy kingdom, Prabalgarh. Wondering for whom this letter could be, Ayaan tries to open the letter but is interrupted by the soldier. He snatches back his letter throwing the one written by Vaidehi on ground and told Ayaan that their letters were replaced and walk away. This strange incident makes Ayaan suspicious.
After some time, the soldier takes the letter to the lonely far side of the castle. He gives the letter to Nardev. The letter was written by Dheerendra Singh, the king of Prabalgarh. He warns Nardev to kill Madhavaditya as soon as possible or else it will lead to dangerous consequences for him. This enrages Nardev. He was calm down by someone hiding in the dark. It turns out to be Bheema!
The truth finally reveals that Nardev along with Bheema were planning to kill King Madhavaditya (with the help of resources sent to them by Prabalgarh) and then becoming the King of Subhangarh. On the other hand, after being married to Vaidehi, half of the land of Subhangarh would be handed over to Bheema i.e to Vaidehi's husband as per Subhangarh's laws. In this way both Nardev and Bheema will conquer Subhangarh and then they will give one-fourth of Subhangarh's land to Prabalgarh as a reward for helping both of them in this conspiracy. It was also revealed that the poison in the glass of milk was also mixed by Nardev and Bheema only.
Nardev writes a letter in reply to Dheerendra Singh's letter informing his further plan of action. Nardev hands over this letter to the soldier who originally brought the letter. The soldier departs for Prabalgarh.
It is revealed that Ayaan secretly heard all their conversation. After learning the truth, Ayaan decides to stop them but felt helpless as he knew that no one will listen to an ordinary soldier like him and that too when he will try to expose kingdom's one of the highest ministers. So, Ayaan decides to keep this matter to himself.
Ayaan catches up with the soldier. After a small fight, Ayaan wins and takes the letter with him in order to show this letter as a proof against Bheema and Nardev to Madhavaditya. But before Ayaan could arrest the corrupt soldier, he throws sand in his eyes, attacks with his knife and ran away leaving Ayaan with a wounded leg and the letter behind. He returns to Bheema and Nardev and told all the situation to them. Bheema asked the soldier to send Rahaka to kill Ayaan.
On the other hand, wounded Ayaan was slowly moving towards the forest to meet Madhavaditya. He was interrupted by a beast like tribal human named Rahaka. Ayaan easily knocks off Rahaka and proceeds further towards the forest. Suddenly Rahaka stands up and hit Ayaan's head with a rock. Then he stabs Ayaan several times with his sharp weapon. Ayaan barely kills Rahaka but is severely injured in the process.
Back to the far side of castle, after learning that Ayaan even killed Rahaka, Nardev is now worried what to do. Bheema tells Nardev that he has a plan for rescue and immediately pricks a poisonous thorn into Nardev's neck leaving Nardev paralyzed. He then shows Nardev Ayaan's knife which he stole before and explains to him that this was all along his plan to kill Nardev and then frame Ayaan for his murder which will result in a clash of Ayaan and Sikandar making them kill each other. And once Ayaan and Sikandar, the two of the greatest warriors of all the time die, no one can come up in his way of killing Madhavaditya and subsequently conquering Vaidehi, the whole Subhangarh and the Prabalgarh. He stabs paralyzed Nardev with Ayaan's knife. Nardev died in shock.
Bheema then calls Sikandar and with the help of his intellect eventually convinces Sikandar about Ayaan's treachery and that Ayaan, after killing Nardev is now going to kill Madhavaditya to become the king of Subhangarh and then forcefully marrying Vaidehi. Bheema orders Sikandar to kill him. Bound by his principles to serve and obey the royalties, Sikandar agrees to do so.
He catches up with the severely injured Ayaan who was merely crawling towards the forest to find the king Madhavaditya. Sikandar lies to Ayaan by saying that he has a change of heart and now puts human values and emotions before the principles. Ayaan becomes happy to learn that he finally got his childhood friend back. He hugs Sikandar. But before he could tell Sikandar the truth. Ayaan was stabbed in back by Sikandar resulting in Ayaan being fatally injured. Before dying, Ayaan gives three letters to Sikandar and asked him to read them before any further action as a last wish. Ayaan dies.
Sikandar starts to read all the letters one by one. First letter was written by Nardev to Dheerendra Singh, after reading to which Sikandar realized that Nardev and Bheema were the real culprits. Second letter was written by Vaidehi to Sikandar, expressing her love for Sikandar, making Sikandar realize that Ayaan was trying to make Vaidehi and Sikandar together and was not trying to forcefully marry Vaidehi. And third letter was written by Ayaan himself to Sikandar in which he describes about their friendship and how lucky Ayaan feels for getting a friend like Sikandar in his life. He requests Sikandar to leave his principles for the sake of his emotions and to marry his true love Vaidehi and also to take care of the orphan children of his caste after him.
After reading all the three letters, Sikandar dropped to his knees and cried a lot for committing such a big blunder of killing Ayaan.
Sikandar then stops Bheema's assassins that were going to kill Madhavaditya and then finally arrests Bheema. After that Bheema is sentenced for a lifetime prison.
After few years, it was shown Sikandar was now a completely different man who places emotions far before principles. He was married happily to Vaidehi with a son named AYAAN."

In the polluted waters, the remains of dead trees serve as a bleak reminder of whole ecosystems long since lost. And yet, the river still flows on, as workers and their families invite Segtowick into their livelihoods and homes with warmth and generosity.Failed repeatedly by local governments and the supposed guaranteed benefits of economic progress that arrive with industry, those living alongside the Caraipé River maintain a quiet dignity and optimism, as well as a warm bond across generations. As the older residents reflect on the course of their lives, their children remain cautiously optimistic about the future. Meanwhile, the very youngest generation still find freedom and excitement in a scorched environment.Wary of inviting a problematic western gaze, Segtowick subtly de-exoticizes Tucuruí's breathtaking landscape with his dramatic monochrome photography, without once sacrificing its power. Often appearing on-camera himself, Segtowick respectfully observes intimate moments amongst the community. Despite the enormous toll on their daily lives, he witnesses the joy as they pray, love, sing and prosper, shooting with a natural style that seamlessly blends both land and water, nature and humanity, the personal and the political.O Reflexo do Lago is a patient testimony to resistance, as well as a sensational document of an environment in crisis."

tt11777952,"['Documentary', 'History']","This is a documentary essay composed entirely of archive photographs and documents of the first big massacre of the Jews in Romania: in the city of Iasi, on the 29th of June 1941, more than 10.000 Jews were killed - first by bullets, than by asphyxiation in freight trains.
The film, which is an attempt to use the montage of archive materials in order to offer a deep and special view of History, has two parts:
The first part of the film could be titled ""the encyclopaedia of the dead"": photographs of the people who were eventually killed by the Romanian army and by civilians are accompanied by voices who recite the documents related to their fate in the massacre: witness accounts, testimonies from the post-war trials, interviews with survivors, private diaries etc.
The second part, shorter, represents a montage of the remaining photographs of the actual massacre (taken mostly by the German soldiers who were in town).
Why a montage film with photographs and texts related to the Jassy pogrom of 1941? Because, as Georges Didi-Huberman shows, ""Montage will precisely be one of the fundamental responses to this problem of the construction of historicity. As it has no simple orientation, montage evades theologies, montage escapes theologies, makes visible the remainders, the anachronisms, the encounters of contradictory temporalities that affect every object, every event, every person, every gesture. Thus, the historian gives up telling ""a story"", but, by doing so, he succeeds in showing that history cannot go without all the complexities of time, all the layers of archaeology, all the dottings of the destiny."""

Parents or siblings dead, homes lost, starvation, insufficient medical care and catastrophic injuries. It's no wonder that many boys choose the perceived dignity of joining an extremist group or militia over the uncertain future of a refugee. For girls, an early marriage offers financial relief for their family and a sense of security in a terrifying world. The stability and health of the family is compromised as husbands and fathers are lost to war and the family forced to relocate and live for years or even decades in a refugee camp.More than 65 million people have been forced from their homes by disasters and war around the world. More than half of them are children. As humanitarian organizations and governments struggle to provide food, shelter and medical attention, a search is under way to find new ways to fight this cycle of violence and misery. The enemy is toxic stress and the weapon is science.Harvard University researchers have been conducting a series of tests, measuring stress levels and cognitive ability of adolescent refugees. Researchers from Yale University have been measuring the cortisol levels, psychological resilience and social/anti-social behavior of these same young people. New studies by Yale and Hashemite Universities are examining the multi-generational effects of profound stress and it's effect on generations of Syrian families. The goal is to better understand the effects of toxic stress on children and to cultivate an ability to become more self-sufficient while building a social and emotional connection with others through senses, language, sports and art.Current neurological and behavioral science offers insights that could have a lasting impact on how we help these children of war to break the cycle of violence.

The films begins on a hill of dirt underneath a concrete road/bridge, the walls are covered in graffiti. The protagonist, King (Liam Bilsky), is masturbating while sitting up against the wall that cancels out the hill. His friend, Devin (Coen Breakson), comes down to the wall from the side entrance explaining that a makeshift pentagram was damaged and it must be replaced. The 2 shout at each other in redneck accents that aren't naturally their own, they argue about collecting sticks from the woods to create a new pentagram until they come to the conclusion that sticks need to be collected. King and Devin make their way over to the opposite side of the hideout where their other 2 friends, Lucius (Matthew Mirea) and Spike (Trenton Marks), make their way down to the hideout via flight of stairs, they are clearly behind schedule. The 4 slide down a dirt hill which leads to the primary section of the hideout which consists of nature and vegetation, a loud never-ending stream of river, misplaced garbage, and a mistreated dirty sofa. King instructs the group to find sticks, only to be immediately bombarded with confusion and shot down with persistent anger from Devin. King marks a poorly constructed pentagram into the dirt with the bottom of a baseball bat and argues with Devin and Lucius (Spike being negligently absent) about it's quality and whether their ""father"", Satan, will be impressed. After hearing a dog barking on the other side of the hideout, the 4 sprint to the dog's location, Devin proceeds to punch the dog, leaving it stunned, weak, and severely hurt. The 4 find the dog's fate hilarious, and King ends the dog's life by striking its skull with the baseball bat he carried with him. Next scene is the opening credits montage set to Tyler, The Creator's ""I Ain't Got Time"", it features the 4 dancing and taking turns smashing their sofa with the baseball bat. The montage is cut short when King turns off the song and addresses a homoerotic lyric said in the song, Lucius and Spike state that Tyler, The Creator is a homosexual which causes a brief homophobic rant from King. We cut to 2 hours later where the 4 are standing at the bottom of the stairs looking ready to leave, Lucius has to leave very soon but King stalls him by talking about his missing knife, Devin calls him out on his decision to not allow Tyler, The Creator to be played and another argument ensues, ending with King dominating and contradicting himself.

Lucius and Devin discuss King's dysfunctions and heinous actions privately in fear of King, only to be interrupted mid-conversation by King's desire to listen to music and dance with the 2.
They dance to 3 death metal songs with the third getting cut short by Devin due to fatigue. King angrily belittles Devin which causes Devin to punch King in the face, and that causes King to slap Lucius in the face. The fight ends with all 3 receiving black eyes. Lucius and Devin sit down in anger and sadness as King plots an explanation to tell to their parents, he adds that his parents will be travelling to Indianapolis for ""a day and a half"" which will give them more hang-out time, but it is heavily implied that Lucius and Devin are opposed to the idea. The time jumps to 11:00 PM, King is having a dream-turned-nightmare that begins with a picture of King and his older sister, Meghan, as infants, a black vignette becomes bolder and closes in on King's face, the rest of the dream entails an unknown teenage boy being held captive and tied up in what could be King's basement, King is wearing a black skull mask and holding a hatchet while he begins to torture the boy by stomping on his arm with increasing force, the dream changes to the boy wearing the mask and wielding the hatchet and King being the incapacitated victim, King lets out a shrill scream and the dream ends.

After King has an outburst over the phone about Spike not buying tape, Spike begins to seemingly lose it. He stares into the security camera in the Electronics section like he's in a trance, and Devin grabs his attention as he was also in the store, Spike explains the situation and King's real name is revealed to be Charlie. Devin and Spike are called back to the hideout but they chat in the food court instead of immediately going. Spike states that he is extremely stressed and that his cousin is in the hospital, Devin tries his best to feel sympathetic towards him. 1 hour later, Charlie sees his older sister Meghan in person, he tries to avoid communication with her and go a different way but she had already seen him. Meghan asks about The Scratchkillas and she is curious as to the absence of a group name change. The 2 walk and chat for a little while, Charlie reveals that in no time, The Scratchkillas will murder a human being. Meghan asks how their parents have been treating him to which he responds by saying everything is fine and he doesn't understand why she ran away from home, she tells him staying at home wasn't part of her destiny and her and her boyfriend have sex very frequently, King tries to escape the conversation but Meghan gets the last word in by explaining that he should also depart from home, claiming he is ""better off without his parents anyway"" and the neighborhood he lives in is ""s**t"", he naively agrees which gets her to finally leave. Charlie comes back to the hideout to find Lucius and Devin waiting for him, he apologizes, makes a poor excuse, and ""gets back to business"" by watching his favorite movie, The Devil's Rejects (2006). Lucius says he prefers Saw to Rob Zombie films which sets Charlie off, and Devin finally decides to quit the redneck act and come face-to-face with Charlie. Charlie tries to defend himself with no luck, he shoves Devin, Devin shoves back, but before a full fight could occur, Lucius fires a round at the ceiling with his revolver that he kept concealed until this point. Lucius points the piece at Charlie, Charlie pleads ignorance and gaslights Lucius into putting the revolver away by simply asking for examples of his bad behavior, Devin is upset with Lucius because of the extreme measures he took to stand up to Charlie, Lucius has an ignorant outburst and sprints up the hill, Devin follows behind him, Charlie panics and has an intense meltdown and soon realizes that he no longer has control over the group, he exclaims that Spike has symptoms of the COVID-19 coronavirus, which is true, and then adds that he also has symptoms, which is a last ditch effort to manipulate them into coming back to him. Charlie begs for forgiveness once more, saying that he has discontinued worshipping Satan and putting on a redneck persona, he repeatedly yells ""I'm nothing!"" until he breaks down into tears. He leaves the hideout and roams the streets of Illinois in a state of shock, bewilderment, and anxiety. He hides and calls his mother, she doesn't pick up, he leaves a message asking when she will return home and proceeds to sprint down the slanted sidewalk. We see that Charlie has been wandering around outdoors through the evening and he is still in the same mental condition, presumably even worse. He comes home and has a psychological hallucinatory breakdown, showing signs of appearance anxiety, severe guilt, sleep deprivation, rage, and a fever. Title card: ""DAY 4, MARCH 16TH"". Charlie stares outside his window from his closet for a few seconds and then notices a botched hangnail pulling procedure on his thumb, his thumb is pouring blood and he reacts very dramatically to the wound. Charlie types ""vids to watch when your sad"" into YouTube and finds a video of a compilation of emotional Simpsons moments set to XXXTentacion's ""I Spoke To The Devil In Miami, He Said Everything Would Be Alright"". The video makes him tear up. We cut to Lucius and Spike holding Devin steady by his arms, Devin is acting very antsy and unusual, Lucius asks Spike what caused him to act this way, Spike states that he told him not to take his medication and that he drank a large amount of coffee, Lucius replies with ""K, we gotta let him loose!"". The 2 boys send Devin down to the hideout where Charlie dwells, Charlie thinks he's being forgiven, but instead he is punched in the ribs and rendered terrified and defenseless. Devin slaps and chokes Charlie as Spike and Lucius cheer from above, Charlie squeals and shrieks, Devin finishes assaulting King right before he passes out. We cut to a montage of Devin, Lucius, and Spike celebrating their freedom by running around town. They play at a children's playground and sit and ponder their accomplishments, but they are forced to run for their lives as the cops have been searching for them, and they have been found. The same picture of Charlie and Meghan as infants reappears overtop of the shot of the boys running from the police, we transition to a garage where tools are set up at a workbench. Charlie is tied to a chair and shirtless, a teenager named William Nervat has a baseball bat in his hand. Charlie wakes up and asks what is happening, William replies with ""I was paid to kill you"". Charlie panics and claims that killing the dog was an accident with an unconvincing unintelligible excuse, William states that the reason he was paid ""wasn't for a dog"", but since he confessed to murdering the dog, his death is justified. William goes to the workbench to pick out something sharp, he places the item down and prepares to use the bat, the camera pans off-screen as we hear the thud and screams of agony, Charlie manages to break free and hurt William with the chair and kill him. We see Charlie sprint out of the house and into the streets, he has his clothes on incorrectly and he has a black eye, his hair is also altered to be less messy. He runs around his suburban neighborhood in an aimless frenzy, trying to figure out what to do next. He notices a ""lost dog"" poster and panics, he picks up a piece of garbage and talks to himself, he argues with himself and freaks out, he vomits over a stair rail, and the scene ends. The next scene shows Charlie calling his mother, she doesn't pick up, so he leaves a message. He confesses that he deserves to go to hell and spend life in prison for murdering their neighbor's kid, and that he will be committing suicide by jumping off a bridge, he adds that he should not land in water but instead he should land on ground because he deserves to experience more pain than water, he blames his mother for everything and says ""I know you're out drinking with Dad"", he explains that Hell is ""not as bad as people say"" and his life is worse than living in Hell, he declares Hell his home and states he will being going there and ""laughing and having a good time"". He ends the message with the phrase ""f**k God!"". We see Charlie stand in front of his front door inside and slit his throat.A series of title cards explain that Charlie Marshall's parents fell into poverty after Charlie's suicide, the other 3 boys were sent to prison for 9 years but died of COVID-19, and Meghan was pimped and murdered.CREDITS"
tt12009240,['Documentary'],"Eleven naked men audition, rehearse and perform for the premiere of master Belgian choreographer Thierry Smits's new contemporary dance piece Anima Ardens. Mixing intimate rehearsal footage with extensive and breathtaking dance sequences, BARE follows the choreographer and his team as they work to explore difficult, often taboo subjects through nudity and dance. In this bold exploration of artistic conflict, gender, and sexuality the one constant is the conceit that the body is the last bastion of personal freedom.Verité-style observations of the dance troupe appear between excerpts of the stunningly choreographed performances. These interludes are as revealing as the dance sequences with their deconstruction of masculinity and gender norms. From the auditions to the final performance, Bare witnesses an erosion of insecurity as some dancers take time to emerge from their shells.The film, however, wrestles with the tensions within the troupe and the personal explorations of the self each dancer undertakes while baring himself to the world. The sumptuous cinematography and ruptured kinetic editing further breaks down the male body with a bacchanal of close-ups as the camera caresses thighs, feet, buttocks, and shafts. These emblems of masculinity appear in rapid-fire montages amid snippets of Hieronymus Bosch paintings and title cards boasting emphatic words like ""male,"" ""phallus,"" and ""strength."" The film strips bare notions of masculinity, gender, and sexuality, creating something altogether new and exciting."
tt12094296,['Documentary'],"Just like other popular European capitals, it seems like Amsterdam is becoming a city where project managers and the ever-expanding tourism industry are running the show. Everywhere?
No!
The subcultural meeting point Vrankrijk is one of the last strongholds resisting the tide in the ever-growing affluence of trendy Amsterdam.The film Vrankrix and the Amsterdam EURnrichment offers a unique and sometimes hilarious insight into the daily lives of people within an almost inaccessible subculture -the stronghold of Vrankrijk, an underground scene of anarchists and activists in downtown Amsterdam. Vrankrijk not only houses 19 residents on its upper floors, but the ground floor is also a core meeting point for international activists and politically radical ideas. Hiphop, punk, queer, refugee issues, do-it-yourself, solidarity, anarchists, sharing economy, veganism, globalization: it all comes together in this micro cosmos.The Vrankrijk community stands in stark contrast with the rest of the city, that is in obvious transition: more and more five-star hotels, luxury condos, shiny shopping malls, busloads of tourists... and neighbors who are moving away to flee from it all. The 'village of savages' is literally becoming more isolated in its fight against their surroundings - people who are proudly resisting the creeping gentrification in the city they love. Please meet Autonomix, Dynamix, Easyfix, Nononsex, Cockadoodledix, Tattootix and Globalixa and their resistance against the worshipping of big money.The comic book of Asterix and the Mansions of the Gods has served as a source of inspiration for Vrankrix and the Amsterdam EURnrichment: the mere existence of a small Gallic village becomes jeopardized by the Roman high-rise construction of hotels, thermal baths, playgrounds and tourists."

The film was split into 88 scenes with 88 teams producing their segment using available resources all while obeying local social distancing guidelines. The result is an absurdly fun, wild ride that sees everything from pro-level live action to killer animation to... bananas and potatoes used to bring Back to the Future Part II to life all over again.Synopsis for original film: On October 26, 1985, Dr. Emmett Brown arrives in the DeLorean time machine and persuades Marty McFly and his girlfriend, Jennifer Parker, to travel to the future with him[N 1] and help their future children, with Biff Tannen witnessing their departure. They arrive on October 21, 2015, where Doc electronically incapacitates Jennifer and leaves her asleep in an alley, explaining that she should not have too much knowledge of future events. He has Marty pose as his own son and lookalike Marty Jr. to refuse an offer to participate in a robbery with Biff's grandson Griff, thus saving both of Marty's children from prison.Marty switches places with Marty Jr. and refuses Griff's offer, but Griff goads Marty into a fight, and a subsequent hoverboard chase ensues. Griff and his gang are arrested, saving Marty's future children. Before rejoining Doc, Marty purchases an almanac, containing the results of major sporting events from 1950 to 2000. Doc discovers it and warns Marty about attempting to profit from time travel. Before Doc can adequately dispose of it, they are interrupted by the police, who have found Jennifer incapacitated and are taking her to her 2015 home. They pursue, as does the elderly Biff, who has overheard their conversation and picks up the discarded almanac.Jennifer wakes up in her 2015 home and hides from the McFly family. She overhears that her future self's life with Marty is not what she expected, due to his involvement in an automobile accident. She witnesses Marty being goaded by his co-worker, Douglas Needles, into a shady business deal, resulting in Marty's firing. Jennifer tries to escape the house but faints after she encounters her 2015 self. While Marty and Doc attend to her, Biff steals the time machine and uses it to travel to 1955 and give the almanac to his younger self, then returns to 2015. Marty, Doc, and an unconscious Jennifer return to 1985, unaware of Biff's actions.The 1985 they return to has changed dramatically: Biff has used the almanac to become one of the wealthiest and most corrupt men in America; changed Hill Valley into a chaotic dystopia; secretly killed Marty's father, George, in 1973; forced Marty's mother, Lorraine, to marry him; and had Doc committed to an insane asylum. Marty and Doc deduce that the 2015 Biff took the time machine to change 1985, and Marty learns from the alternate 1985 Biff that he got the almanac on November 12, 1955. Biff tries to kill Marty, but Marty flees and travels to 1955 with Doc, leaving Jennifer on her own front porch.Marty secretly follows the 1955 Biff, and watches him receive the almanac from his 2015 self. Marty then follows him to the high school dance, being careful to avoid interrupting the events from his previous visit. After several fruitless attempts, Marty finally gets the almanac, leaving Biff to crash into a manure truck. Marty burns the almanac, reversing Biff's changes to the timeline, as Doc hovers above in the time machine. Before Marty can join him, the DeLorean is struck by lightning and disappears. A Western Union courier immediately arrives and delivers a 70-year-old letter to Marty; it is from Doc, who explains that lightning strike transported him back to 1885. Marty races back into town to find the 1955 Doc, who had just helped the original Marty return to 1985. Shocked by Marty's sudden reappearance, Doc faints."

A crook named Lorenzo Rodriguez, AKA Zway-Lo (Nicky Jam), joins him.Mike and Marcus's fellow officers, including Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano), gather at a bar to celebrate Marcus becoming a grandfather. They encounter a woman named Rita (Paola Nunez), who has just been promoted to lieutenant and is also Mike's ex. She informs them that she is also now heading AMMO (Advanced Miami Metro Operations), which employs a younger team of officers. Marcus knows they are getting too old for all the crazy things they used to get into, and he urges Mike to settle down, though he disagrees.

He gets away as the officers rush to help Mike.Mike is in critical condition. Marcus prays to God that Mike be saved, with the promise that Marcus will never bring anymore violence into the world. Rita and Howard then order AMMO - Kelly (Vanessa Hudgens), Dorn (Alexander Ludwig), and Rafe (Charles Melton) - to do what they can do investigate Mike's shooter. Meanwhile, Isabel chastises Armando for going after Mike so soon, as she deliberately wants him to die last so that he suffers watching others die. They proceed to go after a judge, a forensics analyst, and a prosecutor, killing them all in broad daylight.Six months later, Megan and Reggie get married, and Mike has recovered from his injuries. He delivers a speech at the wedding before later asking Marcus to help him catch the shooter, but Marcus refuses, fearing someone else will get hurt, and he insists that he is retired. After learning Mike is awake, Armando uploads his bodycam footage of him shooting Mike. He goes to Rita for help but is also met with the same refusal.Mike takes it upon himself to find his shooter. He visits a retired criminal named Manny The Butcher (DJ Khaled) and beats his hand with a hammer until he gives up the name of a guy named Booker Grassie (Rory Markham), who would have info on the owner of the motorcycle, and therefore the shooter.

She was also heavily into witchery, which gave her the nickname ""La Bruja"".

He recalls running joyously across the island every day, relishing in life and making full, open use of his natural-born powers despite being told to keep them secret.The toddler Sonic rushes home to the treehouse where his doting surrogate mother, Longclaw the Owl is resting, and playfully bumps into her to wake her up. Longclaw warns Sonic that he might have been noticed because of his coveted powers, and sure enough, as Sonic affectionately presents a sunflower to her, they are ambushed by a tribe of echidna archers. Longclaw desperately flies away with Sonic, only for one of the echidnas to fire his arrow and successfully strike her, causing her to plummet to the ground with Sonic still clinging to her. Though injured, Longclaw reminds Sonic of the importance of keeping himself and his powers hidden, and uses a golden ring to open a portal to a world on the far side of the universe, called Earth. She gives the rest of the rings to Sonic in a small bag and tells him to flee to Earth, where he will be safe. The reluctant Sonic runs through the portal while Longclaw stays behind to hold off the approaching echidnas. Seeing her in danger, Sonic desperately runs back to try to save her, but the portal closes just before he can reach her, leaving Sonic heartbroken and alone.Ten years later, Sonic has adjusted to life on Earth. Tom Wachowski, the local sheriff of Green Hills, Montana, is sitting bored in the empty speed trap, waiting for cars, and Sonic playfully messes with him by zipping past his radar gun at ridiculous speeds. Tom discovers one of Sonic's blue quills lying in the long grass and brings it with him as he is called away by his deputy, Wade to address a minor issue. Sonic saves a turtle from being run over by an approaching car and takes the excited reptile for a wild ride before leaving it and zipping back to his hidden cave of a makeshift home. Sonic seems to love his life, since he has great fun with the discarded items he uses to occupy himself, and feels safe since he knows what to do if he is ever discovered. Should he ever be found, he'll escape to one of the worlds depicted on a map included in the bag of rings; an uninhabited world full of giant mushrooms. He hates the idea, but he is not worried, since Green Hills feels like a home to him. He frequents the town every day and secretly observes the people, his favorite of whom is Tom (or ""Donut Lord,"" as he calls him). He also likes Tom's veterinarian wife Maddie, whom he nicknames ""Pretzel Lady"" for her yoga flexibility. He also likes to mess with old, eccentric Crazy Carl, the only person in town who actually knows about him and who is constantly trying in vain to catch him. Having formed a strong bond with Tom and Maddie from afar, Sonic often hangs out around their house, especially on movie nights. But even with this fun place and all of these so-called ""friends"" of his, Sonic still feels very lonely in his self-imposed isolation.After coming home one night to find raccoons in his trash can, Tom receives from Maddie his long-awaited letter of acceptance into the San Francisco Police Department, and the two discuss the difficult decision to move away from Green Hills. The next day, as Tom recites his departure speech to a donut, Sonic observes the local youth baseball playoffs. That night, Sonic goes into the vacant baseball field and plays by himself, using his speed to assume the roles of all the players. He manages to make a perfect play and rejoices, but when he looks around and sees that no one is there to cheer him on, he realizes he is truly alone forever. In his despair, he tries to work off the pain by running desperately around the field, until the energy emitting from his body generates a massive electromagnetic pulse that knocks out power across the entire Pacific Northwest. With the entire town in the dark, the panicking Wade contacts Tom, who gives him instructions but ends the call prematurely when he sees the quill he discovered earlier glowing with electric, blue light.News of the event soon reaches the Pentagon, and the baffled Department of Defense enlists the help of brilliant roboticist and scientific genius, Dr. Robotnik to discover the cause. After Robotnik and his partner, Agent Stone take charge of the military detachment stationed at the baseball field, Robotnik's flying, high-tech, egg-shaped drones head into the forest and discover one of Sonic's footprints. Robotnik discovers that his computer can't find a single match in Earth's animal kingdom to identify the creature responsible for the print. As the military troops and the drones search the forest for Sonic, Sonic rushes back to his cave to collect his valuables and prepares to leave Earth forever. But just before he can use the rings, the troops and drones draw close to his cave and Sonic flees to avoid them, sentimentally bidding goodbye to his cave.Meanwhile, Tom is on the phone with Maddie, who has flown out to San Francisco to visit her sister, Rachel and niece, Jojo. As Tom tells Maddie about the blackout, he hears a disturbance and sees his trash can toppled over. Thinking the raccoons are back, Tom takes Maddie's tranquilizer gun and goes out to investigate the shed. Inside the shed, Sonic prepares to use his ring, but just before he can, Tom bursts into the shed and sees him. Both of them scream in terror at the sight of each other, and Tom fires a dart into Sonic's leg. The weakening Sonic sees a picture of San Francisco's Transamerica Pyramid on Tom's T-shirt, and as he drops his ring, it opens a portal above the actual building itself. Sonic accidentally drops the bag of rings into the portal, and it lands on the building's roof. The portal thusly closes as Sonic passes out, and Tom brings Sonic inside, placing him in a dog cage.Tom examines Sonic and realizes he is Crazy Carl's ""Blue Devil."" Sonic awakens and climbs out of the cage, and the two finally meet for real just as Robotnik's truck arrives. Sonic begs for Tom's help and Tom hides Sonic in the attic as he goes out to meet Robotnik, who dispatches his drones to search the house while the two talk outside. Sonic hides from the drones and curls up into a ball to hide among the various sports balls stored in the attic, but when the drones get too close, Sonic flees the attic and causes a noise. Robotnik barges into the house to find only a raccoon eating a cake that Maddie baked for Tom. As he turns to leave, however, he discovers the quill. As Robotnik threatens Tom to reveal where Sonic is, Sonic shows himself and begs Robotnik to spare Tom, eliciting a terrified scream from Robotnik. Seizing the opportunity, Tom punches Robotnik and knocks him out cold, and after a battle in the house with one of Robotnik's drones, Tom and Sonic escape the house. Agent Stone arrives to check on Robotnik, who berates Stone for not trying to stop the fugitives and tells him to bring the quill.With Tom and Sonic now on the run, Tom asks Sonic to explain himself, and Sonic says that he needs to get to San Francisco so he can get back his lost rings. At first, Tom tells Sonic to go himself, but Sonic doesn't know where San Francisco is, and following Tom's directions to simply head west only causes him to crash straight into the Pacific and run back to Tom wet, cold, covered in seaweed, and wearing a fish. Sonic blames Tom for his fate and insists he can't accomplish his goal alone. Reluctantly, Tom agrees to take Sonic with him to San Francisco.As the two begin their travels, Sonic treats the journey as a fun road trip, admiring the attractions along the way, such as the world's largest rubber band ball. That night, they stop in a certain section of town and Tom tells Sonic to stay in the car as he uses a nearby payphone to call Wade, who reveals that Robotnik and his agents are searching for Tom, and are with him in the station. Furious at having been punched in the face, Robotnik warns Tom that he is coming for him. Meanwhile, Sonic tries desperately to control his excitement over an extremely entertaining-looking biker bar, but eventually caves in. Tom comes back to his car with a purchased meal, only to find Sonic missing. He finds Sonic in the bar and Sonic persuades him to stay and have fun with him. Sonic compiles a ""bucket list"" of the things he'd like to do on Earth, but becomes sad when he realizes he might not be able to do them since he has to leave Earth soon. But Tom encourages Sonic to try to do as much as he can right where they are, and the two take a while to enjoy themselves with all the bar's activities. Unfortunately, a group of rough-looking punks come looking for trouble and Sonic aggravates their leader, starting a bar fight. The leader of the punks attacks Sonic, but Sonic speeds up his awareness and runs around the bar, saving Tom from attackers and setting up sassy pranks and traps to end the fight, all in the span of the single moment before the punk leader can reach him. The fight is ended abruptly by Sonic's devices and the punk leader crashes through the window wearing a wall-mounted bear head. Tom and Sonic flee the bar, outrunning the angry patrons, and spend the night in a local motel.After Sonic runs around the room enjoying himself with various activities, Tom asks him about this other planet to which he must go when he leaves Earth. Sonic reveals that it's a very unenviable place and wonders aloud about whether Longclaw might have been wrong. He ponders having a life on Earth and soon falls asleep. As Tom tucks him in, he sees that one of the items on Sonic's bucket list is to ""make a real friend."" At that moment, the news report features a warning about Tom, who has been declared a domestic terrorist because of his actions in protecting Sonic from Robotnik and the military.The next morning, Robotnik and Stone interrogate the bar patrons, including the punk leader, learning that Tom and Sonic are heading to San Francisco. Robotnik triangulates their location and gives chase. On the road, Sonic asks Tom about what he would have on his own bucket list. Tom reveals his intentions to leave Green Hills to become a San Francisco street cop and prove himself as a hero, but Sonic is baffled by the fact that Tom would want to leave such a perfect town and all the people he cares about. Robotnik finds them and sends out a battle machine called Mayhem. A battle on the road ensues, with Tom and Sonic defeating each of the machine's smaller phases, though the car is badly damaged in the fight. Eventually, Sonic finds himself with a bomb stuck to his hand, and they pull off the road to get rid of it. But just when Sonic manages to get it off, it explodes, knocking Sonic out cold.Tom is relieved to find that Sonic is alive, but Robotnik is enraged, and berates Stone for sympathizing with them. At that moment, however, Robotnik finds that the quill in Stone's pocket is glowing with blue, electric light.Finally reaching San Francisco, Tom rushes to Maddie's house, only to be greeted by a fiercely antagonistic Rachel, who has seen the news reports on him and refuses to let him in until Maddie intervenes. Jojo and Tom's dog, Ozzy come to greet him, and as Rachel and Maddie argue about Tom, Ozzy pulls away the towel in which Tom has wrapped Sonic, revealing him. Rachel faints at the sight and Maddie and Jojo just stare.Robotnik, meanwhile, analyzes the quill and the energy it contains whilst amusing himself by dancing to a tune, until he is startled half to death by the sudden appearance of Agent Stone, who has come to offer a latte. At that moment, the machine finishes analyzing the quill, revealing it to contain unlimited energy, which Robotnik believes can enable his machines to reach their full potential.Tom and Maddie tend to the injured Sonic, while Rachel sits bound in a chair. Maddie uses smelling salts to awaken Sonic, who zips around the room at breathtaking speed before frantically coming to grips with his surroundings and enthusiastically greeting Pretzel Lady. The terrified Maddie asks Tom who and what Sonic is, and Tom reveals the truth of their adventures together and Sonic's intent to reach the Transamerica Pyramid. Jojo brings Sonic a new pair of bright, red shoes, to which he takes an instant liking. Sonic also meets Ozzy, of whom he is jealous, but from whom he enjoys an affectionate face-licking.Tom and Maddie borrow the indignant Rachel's car and head with Sonic to the Transamerica Pyramid, where Tom uses the false pretense of saving a jumper to gain the needed clearance to travel to the roof. Tom and Maddie carry Sonic inside a bag, eliciting grave concern from onlookers who believe that the pair are carrying an abducted child. The three finally reach the roof, where Sonic at last finds and retrieves his bag of rings. After an emotional goodbye between Sonic and Tom, Sonic attempts to throw a ring to open the portal, but it bounces off of one of Robotnik's drones. Many more drones surround the three and Robotnik himself appears in his own flying craft to meet them. After a brief exchange between Robotnik and Tom, Sonic taunts Robotnik by calling him ""Eggman"" after his egg-shaped drones. Robotnik readies his drones to blow the three away, but Sonic pushes Tom and Maddie off the top of the building. Robotnik fires his missiles at Sonic, who speeds up his awareness to avoid them and casually pushes them aside. But Robotnik is able to press a button that charges his vehicle with energy from the quill, and achieves supersonic speed. He fires a blast which Sonic only narrowly avoids, and which knocks him into momentary delirium. Sonic awakes to find Tom and Maddie still falling. He grabs one of the rings falling with him and throws it, opening a portal beneath them that transports the two back to Green Hills. Tom and Maddie end up in a farmer's barn, while back in San Francisco, Sonic lands in a tree before crashing to the ground, along with the rest of the rings and Robotnik's destroyed drones. Meanwhile, the owner of the barn greets Tom and Maddie, asking for their help in aiding a cow's effort to give birth.Robotnik corners Sonic and taunts him, but Sonic gathers up his spilled rings and runs through the city as Robotnik gives chase in his vehicle. Narrating again, Sonic notes how this has brought the film full circle, and earnestly continues the story, wanting to know what happens next just as much as the audience. Robotnik chases Sonic through San Francisco, and Sonic is shocked by Robotnik's ability to keep up with him. Sonic opens a portal to France, with him and Robotnik disrupting a mime act being performed for a young girl as they rush past. Sonic's next ring portal brings him and Robotnik to China, where Robotnik chases Sonic along the Great Wall. Next, Sonic opens a portal to Egypt, where Robotnik destroys many centuries-old monuments in his zeal to catch Sonic. Sonic uses his speed to create a sand whirlwind that temporarily disrupts Robotnik's visual contact, but Robotnik sees Sonic running up the side of one of the Great Pyramids and follows him to the top, firing a blast just as Sonic manages to open another portal ring.The portal brings Sonic back to Green Hills, now at night, but the blast sends him hurtling through the ring and into the street, where he lays motionless. Robotnik's vehicle emerges through the portal and the terrified onlookers flee. Robotnik prepares to kill Sonic, but Tom engages him in physical combat inside the open cockpit of his vehicle. Unfortunately, Tom is knocked out of the cockpit and Robotnik questions why Tom would be willing to throw his life away for a ""silly little alien."" The locals come to defend Tom, but Sonic remains motionless and silent. Robotnik suggests putting the body on ice to keep it fresh and remarks that Sonic was just an alien who didn't belong. Tom responds by telling Robotnik that Sonic knew more about being human than he ever will, proclaiming him to have been his friend, which wakes Sonic up from his wounded daze. Fueled by passion, Sonic charges up with incredible energy and boldly proclaims to Robotnik that he will no longer run away, but use the power which is rightfully his to protect his friends. Robotnik pulls down his goggles and the two opponents prepare to meet in full-on battle. Robotnik fires his missiles, but Sonic avoids them and bounces off the buildings to strike Robotnik's vehicle with an increasingly rapid barrage of body-slams. With the vehicle severely damaged, but still afloat, Sonic calls for Tom to open a portal to the mushroom planet behind Robotnik. Then, at last, Sonic dashes straight at Robotnik's vehicle and strikes it with enough force to send it flying backwards through the portal to the mushroom planet just as the portal closes.Tom and Sonic reunite and Tom gives Sonic back his rings, as well as a high-five: a gift desired by Sonic ever since his having seen a young baseball batter high-five his teammates. Tom tells Maddie that he has decided not to leave Green Hills, feeling that he has already saved a life. As the crowd disperses, Sonic follows Tom and Maddie.The next day, as Tom and Maddie are repairing and repainting their house, one of the officials from the Pentagon comes to thank Tom for defeating Robotnik, and to inform him that his guilt has been erased, along with all records of Robotnik's existence. As a bonus, he presents Tom with an Olive Garden gift card and asks if Sonic might be willing to talk to the President, but Tom falsely claims that Sonic has left so as to spare him that. After the official leaves, Sonic asks if they'd like to see a movie, but Maddie tells him that it's time to go back to his cave. However, when Sonic tries to go, they tell him that they meant something else. Opening the attic door, Tom and Maddie show Sonic his new room, which he is astonished to find contains all of his belongings. Overcome with joy, Sonic runs around and relishes in having his things back. Tom and Maddie sit with Sonic on the bed and welcome him home, and Sonic gives them heartfelt thanks. As the view zooms out and away from the house, Ozzy comes to lick Sonic again, with Sonic still jealous but enjoying the licking.Meanwhile, on the mushroom planet, Robotnik has completely lost his sanity. As he finishes shaving himself totally bald, he gazes at his reflection in a pool of water, now with an extremely long, grown-out mustache that looks completely zany. Talking to a rock that he has carved to resemble Agent Stone, he throws it and tells it to perform ""rock-connaissance"" for him. He reflects on his situation and remarks that a lesser man would die in such a place. But then, he holds up a small container with the quill inside it, and says that he'll be home by Christmas. Pulling down his goggles, he walks like a robot until he finds the stone, which he throws again as he yells out ""rock-connaissance"" once more and laughs maniacally.A mid-credits scene shows forested hills, and on one hill, the leaves stir as a ring portal opens. From it emerges a young, orange fox with two tails, who uses a small handheld device to determine from the present levels of energy whether Sonic might be near. Finding the readings to be sufficient, the young fox hopes aloud that he is not too late to find him and uses his twin tails like helicopter blades to take off flying into the vast forest."

tt6824530,['Documentary'],"United Nation: Three Decades of Drum & BassA shocking and entertaining exposé of the origins of the electronic dance music scene. EDM was born out of the Drum & Bass movement, which began in the early 1990's. The scene and its many style permutations have survived and thrived, and heavily influences Grime and the modern EDM arena.Drum & Bass developed from the London-centric rave scene as an underground movement that rapidly spread across the UK, and then throughout the world. The scene had serious issues with violence and, a sometimes uneasy, drugs culture that plagued its early growth. Governments reacted by bringing in draconian laws in an attempt to kill off the movement. We tell the behind-the-scenes story of what was truly going on, away from the eyes of the 'sorted' masses on the dance floors: the guns, the drugs, the sex, the knives, the gangs and, of course, the artists and performers who, despite all this, advanced the musicTerry ""Turbo"" Stone was a working-class kid brought up on a council estate who, in his teens, saw opportunities in this budding scene. Against the odds, he rose from being on welfare, through handing out flyers to become one of the world's most significant club promoters of the era. He founded ""One Nation"", a massive club movement, and is an award-winning promoter. We were given exclusive access to Turbo's video archive and, through tell-it-all interviews with him, the artists, and those who provided security at the events, document what it was like to be involved in the inception of a whole new musical movement, which still heavily influences the clubs and the music of today."

For centuries, people have been going to war, and when they come home from these battles, everyone says the same thing, 'My loved one came home a different person.'This riveting documentary looks at the lives of warfighters and their families and the struggles they face after returning from combat. For many, the battles continue even out of uniform, as they recover from war-related trauma through a multitude of prescription medicines.In his first feature-length motion picture, producer, director, and military veteran Steve Ellmore presents us with stories from fellow veterans, spouses, and family members on coping with war-related injuries and the loss of loved ones due to suicide. We quickly discover that all the stories are the same. After returning from combat they've all been prescribed what many refer to as the 'combat cocktail' or 'zombie dope,' leading many to believe that suicide is a possible solution to their pain.As the opioid epidemic continues to rise and nearly 22 veterans a day lose their lives to suicide, more and more veterans have turned to marijuana as a safer, more effective alternative to the dangerous mix of drugs they've been prescribed.Since it was first prohibited nearly 100 years ago, we have been taught that marijuana is bad, it's dangerous, it is a gateway drug that leads to more dangerous substances. Now we are learning that we have been systematically lied to through government controlled propaganda.This film turns to experts like Dr. Sue Sisley, the only FDA approved researcher for the efficacy of marijuana for treating PTSD, to find the answer to the question, 'is marijuana safe?'"
tt7713068,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Crime']","The film starts with Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) telling her story from the beginning through an animated intro. As a child, her deadbeat alcoholic dad tried to get rid of her multiple times until he finally dumped her at a Catholic girls school. Harley was always a troublemaker, but she got educated and earned a PhD, becoming a psychologist. That's where she met The Joker and fell in love, leading her to go from Harleen Quinzel to Harley Quinn. However, they have recently broken up since he helped her escape from prison (shown at the end of the previous film 'Suicide Squad'), and despite Harley saying she was fine, she does not take it well and ends up staying alone in a crummy apartment with a hyena she adopted and named Bruce (after Bruce Wayne).Harley goes to the Black Mask club where she gets plastered (drunk) and annoys a nearby thug who insults her. She ends up smashing his leg, and is told by the club's owner, Roman Sionis/Black Mask (Ewan McGregor), that that was his driver. He does nothing because Harley hasn't told anybody that she and Joker are broken up, since them being a couple gave her immunity from the wrath of Gotham's other thugs. Harley is out with other women whom she overhears saying that she's nothing without Joker and that she'll go running back to him soon enough. Harley decides to challenge this by driving a truck into Ace Chemicals where she and Joker used to stay, obliterating the plant into an explosion of fireworks.Moments before this, Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) is investigating what appears to be a mob hit at a restaurant. A flashback shows Helena Bertinelli/Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) killing the men inside with a crossbow, which has earned her the alias, ""The Crossbow Killer."" Montoya then hears the chemical plant explosion and goes to find Harley's J necklace, which is a clear sign to both cops and criminals that she and Joker are no more, meaning Harley has just declared open season on herself.Among the criminals that want Harley dead are Roman and his best friend/right hand man Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina), a psychopath who carves a tally on his body for every one of his victims. They are shown torturing the Keo family and cutting their faces off.Harley is getting her ""perfect egg sandwich"", but Montoya and a few other pissed off crooks find and go after her. Montoya tackles Harley and causes her to drop her sandwich into the street, which devastated Harley. When it seems like she's cornered, she throws a bag of garbage at Montoya, which blindsides one crook and causes him to shoot an incoming truck-driving crook, allowing Harley to get away. Unfortunately, she runs into a large thug that she and Joker face-tattooed, but before he can get her, he is killed by Helena on her motorcycle. Harley is then surrounded by Roman's thugs.Montoya returns to the police station where she is mocked by other officers. She meets with Captain Patrick Erickson (Steven Williams), who was her former partner that took credit for her hard work and got promoted, and District Attorney Ellen Yee (Ali Wong), who is also Montoya's ex. She is building a case against Roman but doesn't have much support from either of them. Montoya is then brought to Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), a young girl brought in for pick pocketing. Montoya then gets a call from Dinah Lance/Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), saying that Cass has a diamond with her. Soon, Harley comes in and tries to go after Cass, but she realizes she is getting ahead of herself in the story.A week earlier at the club, Roman was telling Mr. Keo (Francois Chau) about the Bertinelli Diamond, which contains codes to their massive fortune and is now in Roman's possession. The diamond was also the reason Helena's whole family was slaughtered. Keo refused to work with Roman, which is what later leads to the demise of him and his family. Dinah works at the club as a singer, noted for her beautiful voice. She later talks to a drunken Harley, who admits to her that she and Joker broke up. Harley then drinks with another man who later tries to abduct her. Dinah sees this and beats up the man and his buddies. Roman observes this from his window and is impressed, and he has Zsasz bring Dinah up so he can hire her as his new driver. This leads Montoya to try and get info from Dinah on Roman, but she refuses to help.Dinah knows Cass because they live in the same building, and Dinah has a soft spot for Cass since she knows she lives with abusive foster parents. Later on, Cass picks Zsasz's pocket and steals the diamond, just before she is arrested for other stuff she stole.Just after Harley gets away from Montoya, Roman's guys capture her. She knows he had a long list of grievances against her (such as ""voting for Bernie, pronouncing it 'expresso', and calling him Romey""). Roman smacks Harley around, at which point she has a fantasy about herself as Marilyn Monroe in a ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"" sequence. Before Roman can have Harley killed, he learns from Zsasz that the diamond is gone. Harley offers a chance to recover the diamond, which Roman agrees to. After she leaves, he orders a bounty on Cass.Cut to Harley attacking the police station with colored smoke and confetti bombs. She breaks Cass out but also lets loose other crooks who want to kill her. Harley fights them all on her own, with a little help from Cass, utilizing a baseball bat and lighter, among other things. More goons who want Cass and the diamond shows up, and after inhaling some coke, Harley kills them. She escapes the station with Cass in tow and takes her somewhere safe.Roman learns that Harley and Cass got away from his goons. He loses his shit and spots a woman, Erika (Bojana Novakovic), in his club laughing, and Zsasz convinces Roman that she is laughing at him. He orders Erika to dance on the table and to take off her dress, going as far as to order her friend to cut it off of her. This shows Dinah just how monstrous Roman is.Harley learns that Cass swallowed the diamond and goes to a supermarket to buy laxatives, warning her that anyone else will have no problem cutting it out of her. They rob their supplies and go back to Harley's apartment, which is above a Taiwanese restaurant run by Doc (Dana Lee), a kindly man who keeps Harley safe. After Harley and Cass go upstairs, Helena approaches Doc to ask for Harley. Harley then cuts to Helena's backstory: after her family was murdered by mob boss Stefano Galante (Roberto Catrini), one of Galante's goons saw that she survived but took her away to Sicily to stay with his brother and father. They trained Helena to become the killer that she is now. She killed Galante, and the mob guys from earlier were the firing squad that killed her family. Zsasz is the last name on her list.Back at the police station, Montoya finds out that Yee went behind her back and told Erickson that she stole evidence from a crime scene. Erickson suspends Montoya.Harley's apartment comes under attack by one of Roman's goons. The place gets blown up, and Bruce goes missing. Harley learns that Doc sold her out to Roman's goons because they paid him well. Harley then contacts Roman and offers to trade Cass in exchange for immunity. He agreed and has Dinah drive Zsasz to meet them, but Zsasz spots a text exchange between Dinah and Montoya to let her know where they are headed. He informs Roman, who becomes upset and puts on his Black Mask.Harley arranges to be met at an amusement park in a spot called the Booby Trap where she used to hide with Joker. Cass learns about the betrayal as Harley straps her to a toilet so she can pass the diamond. Montoya shows up first and fights Harley, nearly taking her in until Harley uncuffs herself and kicks Montoya out of the building. Dinah and Zsasz show up, but Zsasz hits Harley with a tranquilizer and prepares to kill her. Helena shows up and shoots Zsasz in the neck with an arrow, killing him. The ladies then confront each other until they see Roman show up outside with a whole army of thugs. Knowing that he has a bone to pick with all of them, Harley suggests they team up to fight them all. They reluctantly agree and grab a bunch of old weapons (mallet for Harley, bat for Dinah, brass knuckles for Montoya, etc) and head off to fight. They smash and bash their way through a bunch of goons before Roman manages to kidnap Cass. The ladies are cornered by armed goons until Dinah lets out a supersonic scream to take them down and allow Harley to go after Roman on roller blades.Harley chases Roman and gets knocked over by other goons. Helena rides by and gives Harley a pull, managing to kill those other goons before causing Roman's car to crash. He takes Cass to the pier and tries to taunt Harley, saying she needs him. She hits back that the criminals in Gotham should fear her, not him or Joker. Before Roman can hurt Cass, she reveals she planted a grenade on him and pulled the pin out. Harley throws Roman off the pier where he explodes into bloody chunks before hitting the water. The others join Harley and Cass, relieved that Roman is now gone.The next morning, the ladies gather for tacos and margaritas. Cass goes to pass the diamond, but she and Harley just steal Dinah's car and ride off.Later on, Erickson once again takes credit for Montoya's work in bringing down Roman and his empire. She quits the GCPD and joins Dinah and Helena to form the Birds of Prey using the money in the Bertinelli accounts.Harley and Cass pawn the diamond and ride away with Bruce (who turned up alive), with Harley taking Cass on as her apprentice. Harley says she may be a softie, but she dares anyone else to call her that.After the credits:Harley's voice can be heard getting ready to tell the audience a big secret about Batman... only for the audio to cut off."

tt7934860,['Documentary'],"The author of more than forty works of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, which have been translated into more than thirty languages, Barry Gifford writes distinctly American stories for readers around the globe. He has been honored with numerous awards, ranging from Italy's Premio Brancati to recognition by the Writers Guild of America and the Christopher Isherwood Foundation. From screenplays (including LOST HIGHWAY, co-written with David Lynch, and CITY OF GHOSTS, a collaboration with Matt Dillon), poetry, and librettos to his acclaimed Sailor and Lula novels (a series which began with WILD AT HEART),
Gifford's writing is as distinctive as it is difficult to classify. Born in Chicago in 1946, the son of a former Texas beauty queen and a father involved with organized crime, Gifford also spent time in Havana, Key West, and New Orleans
while growing up. This varied geography proved significant: throughout his career, Gifford's fiction is born of the clash between what he has referred to as his ""Northern Side"" and ""Southern Side.""This ""Northern Side"" is explored in Gifford's Roy stories, an autobiographical cycle of interlocking tales written over a period of more than forty years which serve as the foundation of ROY'S WORLD: BARRY GIFFORD'S CHICAGO. Roy, a kid coming of age largely on the gritty streets of 1950s Chicago, is essentially a fictional version of Gifford, tracing his childhood from around the age of five through his teenage years. Through this surrogate, the reader/viewer experiences a slice of Chicago history, from its pervasive municipal corruption, typified in the rise to power of Mayor Richard J. Daley, to the dawn of the tumultuous 60s. ""I realized what I was doing, especially in writing the Roy stories, was writing a kind of a literary history."" says Gifford, in voiceover from the documentary. ""A friend of mine whom I'd gone to high school with, he said, 'You know, you're really writing history here. Not necessarily just your life or your observations but, you know, thinking about the history of a place and people and language.'""In ROY'S WORLD, excerpts from the Roy stories performed by Willem Dafoe, Matt Dillon, and Lili Taylor are interwoven with Gifford's recollections of his childhood in the Second City. Fusing archival materials with animated sequences and an evocative jazz score, ROY'S WORLD presents an impressionistic portrait of a vanished world."

tt8477336,['Drama'],"Amadi, a musician from Lagos, Nigeria, arrives in São Paulo, Brazil, with a mission: to locate his brother, Ikenna, who has recently broken all ties with their family - becoming, as the Igbo say, ""lost in transition"" - and bring him back to Nigeria. Amadi, who was always been more laid-back and carefree, in contrast to Ikenna's more objective-driven personality, has to rise to the occasion so as to not frustrate his parents, as well as for self-serving reasons: he is worried that if Ikenna is not found, the older-brother mantle will be left to him, and with it, the responsibility to provide for their family. In Brazil Amadi follows the faint footsteps left by Ikenna in this foreign urban landscape: he learns that his brother is not the distinguished Mathematics professor he was made out to be, but actually has contrived an intricate and nearly- delusional series of schemes to accumulate wealth in Brazil, which includes, among other things, the supposed discovery of the statistical principles behind horse-race gambling. Slowly, Amadi closes in his brother, always finding himself one step behind, having to confront the remnants of his presence in progressively more ominous underworld surroundings. Amadi's wonderment with this foreign land, as well as the bitter feelings he harbors towards his brother for always being the chosen one, is focused on Emília, Ikenna's Brazilian ex-lover who provides a tempting excuse for Amadi to ignore his assignment and start imagining a life in this weird alien land. Finally, when confronted with a concrete possibility of actually meeting his now dejected sibling, Amadi is forced to choose between his faithfulness to his family abroad or the yearning to start a new life in São Paulo."

After the wedding, Burr congratulates Hamilton on his position as aide-de-camp to Washington; Hamilton admits that he would much rather have Burr's position on the battlefield (""The Story of Tonight (Reprise)""). Burr reflects on Hamilton's swift rise while considering his career as more cautious (""Wait For It"").As conditions worsen for the Continental Army, Hamilton aids Laurens in a duel against Charles Lee (""Stay Alive""), who insulted Washington. Laurens injures Lee, who in turn yields (""Ten Duel Commandments""). Hamilton is temporarily suspended by Washington (""Meet Me Inside"") over the duel and is sent home. There, Eliza reveals that she is pregnant with her first child, and asks Hamilton to slow down to take in what has happened in their lives (""That Would Be Enough""). After Lafayette convinces France to get involved on the colonists' side (""Guns and Ships""), he urges Washington to call Hamilton back to help plan the final Siege of Yorktown. Washington agrees but explains to Hamilton-who is convinced he should die a martyr and a hero in war-that he should be careful with his actions because whatever he does will be known for ages to come (""History Has Its Eyes on You""). At the Siege of Yorktown, Hamilton meets up with Lafayette to take down the British, revealing that Mulligan was recruited as a spy, helping them figure out how to trap the British and win the war (""Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)"").Soon after the victory at Yorktown, King George asks the rebels how they will succeed in governing on their own (""What Comes Next?"").

Burr switches political parties and defeats Philip Schuyler, making Hamilton now a rival (""Schuyler Defeated"").In another Cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in its conflict with Britain. President Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument for remaining neutral (""Cabinet Battle #2""). In the wake of this, Jefferson, Madison, and Burr decide to join forces to find a way to discredit Hamilton in Washington's eyes (""Washington on Your Side""). Washington decides to retire from the presidency, and Hamilton assists in writing a farewell address (""One Last Time"").A flabbergasted King George receives word that George Washington has stepped down, and will be replaced by Paris signatory John Adams (""I Know Him""). John Adams becomes the second President and fires Hamilton, who publishes an inflammatory critique of the new president as a response (""The Adams Administration""). In the face of accusations of speculation of government funds by Jefferson, Madison, and Burr-and out of fear that his affair with Maria Reynolds will be used against him in his political career (""We Know"")-Hamilton chooses to publicize his affair (""Hurricane"") in the Reynolds Pamphlet (""The Reynolds Pamphlet""), damaging his relationship with Eliza. Eliza, in a heartbroken retaliation, burns all the letters Hamilton wrote her, trying to erase herself from history (""Burn"").

During the duel, both Burr and Hamilton fire at each other after ten paces, with Hamilton intentionally missing (throwing away) his shot. Hamilton dies as a result, with Eliza and Angelica at his side. Burr laments that even though he survived, he is cursed to be remembered as the villain who killed Hamilton (""The World Was Wide Enough""). The musical closes with a reflection on historical memory, showing how Eliza kept Hamilton's legacy alive (""Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story"")."

Aware that any wish of his mother's could be her last, Ryan begrudgingly agrees and sets off to collect Sunny in a banged up Vauxhall Corsa that will become their home for the next 3 days.

Ryan travels back alone, lamenting the way he and Sunny parted. As he arrives home to see his mother in worsening health he realizes he will soon be all alone. And 4 months later that proves to be the case. Having seen, but not spoken to Sunny, at his mother's funeral Ryan cautiously visits Sunny at her home. Ryan produces a bag of pinecones, but his romantic gesture is batted away when Sunny tells him they're everywhere so she has plenty. They're back to square one. Maybe even further back. But determined not to let her slip out of his life, he tells her how much the time they spent together meant to him. To his surprise, Sunny reveals she feels the same. Ryan takes his car keys from his pocket, both sharing the realisation that they have the whole world and the rest of their lives in front of them, and in a weird and wonderful way they are the perfect companions for each other on that journey.

Years ago, he lost touch with his inner ego and his marriage to JEANNE FOURQUET-MAIER (44) was just a logical consequence of his strict work ethic. Which does not mean that he does not suffer from the separation: Alexander makes every effort not to lose contact with his son THÉO (16), and has not given up the hope that Jeanne would return to him if he only his changed his priorities.
But then HANS-WERNER BROCKMANN (59) burst into Alexander's life.

Alexander suddenly feels a long-lost power and energy in him - a blossoming masculinity that is even noticed by Jeanne.
But what looked like a great venture to new shores, soon becomes a fierce battle for the future of the company. How sustainable should the changes be? How risky is restructuring? Alexander painfully realizes that Brockmann did not really take his ideas seriously and wants to pursue a growth course that will either give the company unexpectedly high profits - or ruin them mercilessly.

I remember being at concert in Mumbai and watching some Sufi Fakirs from Sindh perform, I was so blown away, I ran home and googled Sindh for the first time. When I found out Sindhi migration was the largest migration of a culture in history and I being a Sindhi had no idea, I knew it was time to start.What is Sindh?
In 1947 when India was partitioned, Punjab and Bengal were divided but Sindh was left intact in Pakistan. In the province, it was believed that nothing would change - the Hindus had been a minority for centuries, they were the ones with the wealth and power. However, when the time came, the best they could do was escape with their lives. Hordes of prosperous people became homeless and penniless overnight. A large majority had never left Sindh before. They crossed the new border to settle in unfamiliar lands with unfamiliar food, language and customs, stepping from a zone of sparse rain into monsoon country.There are lots of books written on Sindh and loads of information online but I did not want my film to be a history lesson. It took me 2 years to figure out how I want to tell my story. This moment with my grandma came to mind. I had just started getting inked And remember covering myself to meet my grandmother for lunch one day. She looked at me and called me old fashioned. I couldn't believe a 70 year old woman was calling me old fashioned. She told me when we first came on this planet we lived in tribes we didn't have borders and governments and countries. We had extended families and all had their own markings. ""When I see you I see you are going back to your roots and that makes me very happy.""
It was evident that ink was going to be the ink I would write their stories with.I figured, the best way to tell this story was to become the story.My documentary includes many stories. Some from India and some from Sindh (which now lies in Pakistan) along with mine illustrating their journey on my skin. I aim at inking my legs using an art form from Sindh (Ajrak) and one from India (Madhubani) to tell the story of a land carried on the shoulders of its people and not rooted in any soil.My legs, symbolising our journey and my feet, the lack of our roots.""no one leaves home unless
home is the mouth of a shark
you only run for the border
when you see the whole city running as well""

Moreover, much of media coverage is often misinformed or misleading and the general public is still confused about the technology and its larger implications.Can this technology, designed to operate independent of trust and within a decentralized network, really provide a robust alternative?
Can it and the people behind it be trusted to secure elections, prevent financial meltdowns and keep our private information safe?
Or are cryptocurrencies just as unfairly distributed, easily manipulated and dangerous as our current systems?Join award-winning filmmaker Torsten Hoffmann four years after his first Bitcoin documentary, Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It, on his journey to find the answers to these important questions that may redefine the future of the Internet (Web 3.0).With the proliferation of the Internet, the power of Governments and large tech corporations has reached unprecedented levels. In fact, in the past few yearsOur privacy has been jeopardized,
Our social media weaponized,
And our democracies compromised
